0225669264fddf6468671f32f24ac05e3e84fdbd,A blended learning approach for teaching computer science in high schools,"The purpose of this research is to determine the proficiency levels of teachers giving computer education in high schools regarding blended learning. In this study, the competencies of teachers who give computer education in high schools regarding blended learning were handled in accordance with the survey model, which is one of the quantitative research methods. The study group of the research consists of 345 computer teachers who teach in high schools in the city of Almaty, Kazakhstan in the 2021–2022 academic year. The data of the study were collected with the blended learning proficiency scale developed by the researchers. As a result of the research, it was seen that the teachers giving computer education in high schools were high in the motivation sub-dimension of blended learning and moderate in the application sub-dimension. It has been determined that the blended learning competencies of the teachers are at a moderate level throughout the scale. Teachers’ competencies in blended learning show a significant difference according to the gender variable. As a result of the research, it was determined that the blended learning competencies of female teachers were higher than male teachers. It was concluded that teachers’ blended learning competencies did not show a significant difference according to the seniority variable. In-service training courses should be organised to increase the blended learning competencies of teachers giving computer education in high schools.

6c87a0bf0c731c9459b26fc689ff6564e52125af,Expanding Computer Science Access by Studying the Impact of AP CS Principles Curriculum,"This lightning talk describes the effort to expand access to computer science at IDEA Public Schools, with a goal of 33% of students enrolling in computer science before graduation. The primary driver of this effort is a 30-school randomized control trial (RCT) that is studying the impact of Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles curriculum from Code.org and The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC). Each school has each been assigned, at random, either Code.org or BJC and will use the assigned curriculum for a period of 3 years while the impact is evaluated. The 2021-2022 school year is the first year of this program. As a means of providing support to teachers and schools, a district-level computer science manager is creating and curating resources, including pacing guides, unit plans, exam reviews, and topic videos. In addition to the provider-facilitated summer trainings, the district provides a 3-day new-teacher content training, quarterly full-day course collaboration sessions, and bi-weekly one-hour support webinars, all focusing on AP Computer Science Principles. Further, four course leaders, current teachers with proven track records of success have been assigned to facilitate professional development and provide informal coaching to our cohort. The need for schools to competently implement the Code.org or BJC curriculum as part of the 30-school RCT has been the key factor in deciding the depth of support to provide for the AP CS Principles program.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3478432.3499249?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3478432.3499249, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

FEATURES OF VESTIBULAR MIGRAINE DIAGNOSIS Zlata Borshchova 4th year student, 4th medical faculty Kharkiv Nationa","Actuality. Dizziness and headache are two very common conditions in the general population. However, the main disorder associated with dizziness and headache is vestibular migraine (VM) (formerly known as migraine dizziness or migraine-related dizziness) [1]. Despite the prevalence of VM and published diagnostic criteria, it still remains an underdiagnosed condition, which does not allow for specific therapy and obtain the desired positive effect. The cause of this diagnostic problem can be a wide range of additional symptoms, lack of headache in almost half of VM cases, as well as poor knowledge of diagnostic criteria and lack of cooperation between the neurological and otolaryngological community [2].",Grail of Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.36074/grail-of-science.29.04.2022.119', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.36074/grail-of-science.29.04.2022.119?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.36074/grail-of-science.29.04.2022.119, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The future of the nation is in their hands. Adolescent girls as teenagers besides being the nation's successors in the field of development also play a role in giving birth to the next generation biologically. As the nation's successor, young women are expected to be healthy so that the quality of the nation's children is physically, psychologically and intellectually healthy. Normally, young women experience menstruation every month with a span of 21-35 days each time they menstruate. The normal menstrual cycle physiologically describes the reproductive organs that tend to be healthy and not problematic. When young women are stressed, it can cause menstrual cycle disorders, This study aims to determine the relationship between stress levels and menstrual cycle disorders in adolescent girls in grades X and XI at the Nafsiah Stabat Health Vocational School in 2022. The type of research used is descriptive correlation with a cross sectional study design. The research was conducted at the Nafsiah Stabat Health Vocational School with a sample of 34 people. Based on the results of the chi-square test using a computer, the results (p value) = 0.000 which is smaller than 0.05 can be concluded that Ho is rejected and Ha is accepted at a 5% significance level.

8cf701132d60e936c82a45beb20f05b483e7d4cf,Overview of the Special Issue “2022 Year of Mineralogy”,"“Year of Mineralogy 2022” is a global initiative that aims to highlight the importance of mineralogy not only as a basic science, but also in our everyday lives (Fig. 1). It consists of coordinated activities at regional, national, and international levels, and takes place under the patronage of the International Year of Basic Science for Sustainable Development, which is supported by UNESCO. 2022 marks the bicentennial of the death of French mineralogist René-Just Haüy (1743­1822), who is known as a father of modern mineralogy and crystallography. It is also the 200th anniversary of the publication of “Traité de mineralogy” and “Traité de cristallographie,” which were authored by Haüy. It is, therefore, significant that we have been given an opportunity to publish a special issue of this journal, which reviews contributions of minerals and mineralogy to geology, as a part of our activities during the “Year of Mineralogy.” Minerals are not only interesting natural materials that play significant roles in industry as resources, but are also important in geology and other sciences for providing evidence of research results and as specimens to be preserved for future generations. Mineralogy is a science with a long history. It has played a key role in the development of science and technology, including our understanding of the nature of materials. This special issue consists of eight review articles and one original article by expert mineralogists, petrologists, crystallographers, and geologists in Japan who are leaders in the mineral sciences. Theophrastus wrote that stone comes from earth, based on Aristotle’s four elements─earth, fire, air, and water. Pliny featured stone extensively in his “Natural History.” In the 16th century, when Agricola wrote “De re metallica” and “De Natura Fossilium,” stone was collectively referred to as fossil (dug up), along with current fossils and stone tools. Tagai (2022) traces the history of mineralogy back to the Greek and Roman periods, covering contributions to classical mineralogy by Werner and others, the establishment of classical crystallography by Steno and Haüy, and the inception of modern mineralogy and modern crystallography through the discovery of X-rays by Röntgen and X-ray diffraction experiments by Laue and Braggs. He also reviews the progress in mineralogy and crystallography in modern Japan, which is based on work by Wada. A mineral substance is a naturally occurring solid that has been formed by geological processes, either on the Earth or in extraterrestrial bodies (IMA Nomenclature; Nickel and Grice, 1998). A mineral species is a mineral substance with well defined chemical composition and crystallographic properties, such as an arrangement of chemical bonds in a crystal structure, and which merits a unique mineral name. The Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names, a predecessor of the Commission on New Mineral, Mineral Name and Classification, of the International Mineralogical Association was established in 1959 for the purpose of controlling the introduction of new minerals and mineral names and, of rationalizing mineral nomenclature.

Technical summary We synthesize 10 topics within climate research where there have been significant advances or emerging scientific consensus since January 2021. The selection of these insights was based on input from an international open call with broad disciplinary scope. Findings concern: (1) new aspects of soft and hard limits to adaptation; (2) the emergence of regional vulnerability hotspots from climate impacts and human vulnerability; (3) new threats on the climate–health horizon – some involving plants and animals; (4) climate (im)mobility and the need for anticipatory action; (5) security and climate; (6) sustainable land management as a prerequisite to land-based solutions; (7) sustainable finance practices in the private sector and the need for political guidance; (8) the urgent planetary imperative for addressing losses and damages; (9) inclusive societal choices for climate-resilient development and (10) how to overcome barriers to accelerate mitigation and limit global warming to below 2°C.

The new curriculum  is needed as a way out of the  learning process that is in line with the demands of the times and pandemic conditions, where changes in regulations and the learning process can occur at any time. This paper aims to explain the concept of the Prototype Curriculum at the PAUD level which is implemented in PAUD Mutiara Yogyakarta for the 2022/2023 Academic Year. This research uses a normative or literature approach, with primary data sources in the form of documents related to the research  focus.  The results  showed that through the Driving  School Program, a new curriculum concept called the Prototype Curriculum was obtained. At the PAUD level, the learning process is directed at 3 (three) Learning Outcomes (CP), namely: religious values and ethics; identity; the basis of STEAM literacy (science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics).  Learning Outcomes themselves have been previously known through the 2013 Curriculum with the terms Basic Competencies (KD) and Core Competencies (KI).

Our objective is to analyze research trends in CM field and compare contributions from different countries, institutions and authors. Methods We extracted all CM-related publications published from 1997 to 2022 from the Web of Science database and applied Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer to review publication data, analyze publication trends, and visualize relevant data. Results A total of 708 publications were identified. The United States contributed the most publications (280) and citations (8,781 times) with the highest H-index value (47). The Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, British Journal of Ophthalmology, American Journal of Ophthalmology and Cornea were the most productive journal concerning CM, and Shields CL, Shields JA, Jager MJ as well as Finger PT had published the most papers in the field. Keywords were classified into three clusters: clinical research, management-related research and genetic research. The keywords “primary acquired melanosis”, “metastasis” and “BRAF mutations” were most frequently emerged. According to the average appearing year (AAY), targeted therapy (AAY of 2019.0) and nivolumab (AAY of 2018.7) were identified as the main focuses of the field in the near future. Conclusion In the past 25 years, the United States, Germany, England and the Netherlands held the leading position in the CM research. A group of scholars made important contributions to CM research and will continue to guide cutting-edge research. Treatments that have been shown to be effective for advanced cutaneous melanoma, such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, are potential focuses for future CM research.",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0,4,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.960494/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9433576, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Even though the precise mechanism of sepsis remains unclear, scientific advances have highlighted the key role of various programmed cell death processes in the pathophysiology of sepsis. The current study aims to explore the worldwide research trend on programmed cell death in the setting of sepsis and assesses the achievements of publications from various countries, institutions, journals, and authors globally. Material and methods Associated publications during 2002–2022 with the topical subject of sepsis and programmed cell death were extracted from the Web of Science. VOSviewer was utilized to evaluate and map the published trend in the relevant fields. Results All 2,037 relevant manuscripts with a total citation of 71,575 times were screened out by the end of 1 January 2022. China accounted for the largest number of publications (45.07%) and was accompanied by corporate citations (11,037) and H-index (48), which ranked second globally. The United States has been ranked first place with the highest citations (30,775) and H-index (88), despite a low publication number (29.95%), which was subsequent to China. The journal Shock accounted for the largest number of publications in this area. R. S. Hotchkiss, affiliated with Washington University, was considered to have published the most papers in the relevant fields (57) and achieved the highest citation frequencies (9,523). The primary keywords on the topic of programmed cell death in sepsis remarkably focused on “inflammation” “immunosuppression”, and “oxidative stress”, which were recognized as the core mechanisms of sepsis, eventually attributing to programmed cell death. The involved research on programmed cell death induced by immune dysregulation of sepsis was undoubtedly the hotspot in the pertinent areas. Conclusions The United States has been academically outstanding in sepsis-related research. There appears to be an incompatible performance between publications and quantity with China. Frontier advances may be consulted in the journal Shock. The leading-edge research on the scope of programmed cell death in sepsis should preferably focus on immune dissonance-related studies in the future.",Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,2022.0,4,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2022.999569/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537822, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This review examined studies carried out on adolescent/youth-friendly SRHS with focus on availability, accessibility, utilization as well as perception of health care providers, and adolescents about the services. The study design was systematic review of empirical studies using a well-defined strategy. Online journal was searched comprehensively using Web of Science, Google Scholars databases, PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE. Other sources were identified through the scanning of references of selected sources. The articles selected were between 2016 and 2022 and had qualitative/quantitative and mixed methods. The articles that met the selection criteria were also screened using PRISMA-P guidelines and SPIDER framework for systematic review was further used for inclusion criteria based on the following concepts: sample, phenomenon of interest, design, evaluation and research type. A total number of 32 studies were included in the study and findings were reported based on the five emerging themes. The review showed that majority of the adolescents were not aware of adolescent/youth-friendly SRHS, some health care providers were not also in support of the services which accounted for low utilization of the services among adolescents. The review further showed poor accessibility and nonavailability of AYFSRHS as the only available SRHS were meant for married adults. Therefore, these findings serve as evidence for policy-makers at all the levels of healthcare delivery system to considered all the factors observed in this review and develop strategies that will make adolescent/youth-friendly SRHS available and accessible to adolescents. More so, other stakeholders, especially health care providers must improve their attitude toward provision of adolescent/youth-friendly SRHS.",Journal of Integrative Nursing,2022.0,5,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.4103/jin.jin_79_22', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4103/jin.jin_79_22?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4103/jin.jin_79_22, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

AI also has made it possible to execute human tasks without the need for humans. However, there is one important concern with consciousness. This is because consciousness is one of the most defining qualities between AI and humans. So, this study presents a literature review and bibliometric analysis of artificial and mind consciousness research around the world from 2000 to 2022 in order to provide researchers and scholars around the world with an overview of the results and trends in artificial and mind consciousness research. A textual query on two databases; Scopus (289 papers), and Web of Science (303 papers) using the term “artificial consciousness” OR “mind consciousness” was performed on 10 June 2022 retrieving 509 scholarly papers from 2000 to 2022 related to artificial and mind consciousness studies for in-depth analysis. Bibliometric analysis were performed using Rstudio software version 4.2.0 and biblioshiniy for bibliometrix to visualize and analyze trends of artificial and mind consciousness research. This bibliometric analysis was analyzed the annual scientific publication growth, the most productive authors, most frequent word has been using, most famous journal name, and which countries has highest collaboration with other country. According to the findings of the analysis, there is significant inconsistency in global trends in annual scientific production, with the number of publications increasing and decreasing. Among all countries, United States (USA) contributed the most publications in the field of artificial and mind consciousness research. According to the findings has show the most relevant authors is Kelley TM (Scopus), and Patel AD (WoS). Moreover, the most relevant journals articles in artificial and mind consciousness studies is Procedia Computer Science (Scopus), and Journal Of Consciousness Studies (WoS). The implication of this study is can help new researchers in this field by providing information on relevant publications and authors to consult when conducting research on this topic. Furthermore, this research helps other researchers understand current trends in this area of study. As a result, the justification for doing this study is to provide the first bibliometric analysis and to fill research gaps in bibliometric studies of artificial consciousness and the mind by providing information in the form of a literature review, overview, and guidelines.",e-Bangi Journal of Social Science and Humanities,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'http://journalarticle.ukm.my/20925/1/A%20LITERATURE%20REVIEW%20AND%20BIBLIOMETRIC%20ANALYSIS%20OF%20MIND%20AND%20ARTIFICIAL%20CONSCIOUSNESS%20WORLDWIDE%20OVER%20THE%20YEAR%202000%20%E2%80%93%202022.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17576/ebangi.2022.1905.01?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17576/ebangi.2022.1905.01, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Three priority areas are featured in the plan: strengthening the global psychological science community, making psychological science more meaningful in the public sphere, and using resources wisely and efficiently to advance the mission of the society. As explained in the plan itself, the third of these priority areas is “inwardly focused” (p. 8) and concerns the manner in which APS does business. The other two are “public-facing” (p. 8) and concern the audience that APS serves and aspires to serve. As one of the tools available to APS to further these agendas, it is reasonable and appropriate for Psychological Science to contribute to the effort. Accordingly, in this editorial, I introduce three initiatives for Psychological Science designed to promote the two public-facing priorities. Two initiatives are aimed at strengthening the global psychological science community by diversifying the populations represented in the research published in the journal and diversifying the scientists who author it. The third initiative is aimed at making psychological science more meaningful in the public sphere by bringing greater authenticity to the research we publish.",Psychology Science,2022.0,4,"{'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/09567976221133816', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/09567976221133816?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976221133816, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

87afda2e4e97bcc786283216413dd69af9f22caf,Mapping the health science librarianship research field in 2012–2022,"Introduction Evidence-based practice is an important aspect of health science librarianship. However, good evidence-based practice can only occur if the body of evidence is also of adequate quality. By using bibliometric techniques to map the health science librarianship research field, one can better understand the properties of the evidence base in health science librarianship. Methods The Library Literature & Information Science Full Text database was used to generate a bibliography of publications pertaining to health librarianship limited to the time span of 2012–2022. Using Excel and Microsoft Power BI, a descriptive analysis was conducted. VosViewer was used to create a subject term co-occurrence map. Results The average number of publications per year is 207.3 and it was trending downwards for 2012–2022. The most frequently assigned subject term was “survey”. The average number of authors per paper is 2.5 and was trending upwards. The subject term co-occurrence map identified 5 clusters of keywords, which were interpreted as major themes found in the body of literature.

What are students’ feelings and opinions towards online education? 3. What are the impacts of distance learning on students’ development of their PCK skills? And 4. What is students’ academic achievement in taught online science education courses? To collect data, a total sample of 117 students enrolled in undergraduate program for science teaching at the elementary level, was used. Data was collected over three semesters, during the academic years 2020/2021 and 2021/2022. The data collection tools used are: a. a questionnaire administered to students enrolled in their 2nd through the 6th semesters, at the Faculty of Education, Lebanese University, at the end of science education courses, b. students’ grades in formative and summative assessments in science education courses, c. students’ drawing themselves as remote learners, and d. a post-interview of a purposeful sample. Data analysis was done using interim analysis in the form of post-zoom class conferences and data validation using member check at the end of courses. Findings showed that students at the beginning of the state successive and long lockdowns were happy to learn remotely. But as time passes, they were dissatisfied with online learning, 38% of students missed the campus life and 16% lacked the interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, students’ academic performance decreased significantly and many were concerned about the little expertise to deal with students in real classes. For 57% of students, distance learning was difficult than classroom, and 70.5% admitted that home environment was not suitable for participating in online lectures due to distractions by their families.

Considering that the worldwide travel restriction and the impact of COVID-19, this conference was carried out in the virtual form to avoid personnel gatherings. Because most participants were still highly enthusiastic about participating in this conference, we chose to carry out via online platform according to the original schedule instead of postponing it. 
MMTCS 2022 brought together innovative academics and industrial experts in the fields of modern medicine technology and clinical science and applications to a common forum. The primary goal of the conference is to promote research and developmental activities, and another goal is to promote scientific information interchange between researchers, developers, engineers, students, and practitioners working all around the world. The conference will be held every year to make it an ideal platform for people to share views and experiences in related areas. 
This scientific event brought together more than 70 national and international researchers. During the conference, the conference model was divided into three sessions, including oral presentations, keynote speeches, and online Q & A discussion. All the papers have been processed to meet the requirements of international publication standard. We selected a bunch of high-quality papers and compiled them into proceedings after rigorously reviewing. 
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the distinguished keynote speakers, as well as all the participants. We also want to thank the publisher for publishing the proceedings. May the readers could enjoy and gain some valuable knowledge from the MMTCS 2022 proceedings. We are expecting more and more experts and scholars from all over the world to join this international event next year.

e223cb4eb11bf676d7c71e2fe7a1cea310d52a23,'Only One Earth' – Celebrating soil science on World Environment Day 2022,"This Editorial introduces a EJSS Thematic Virtual Issue to highlight the importance of soils to celebrate World Environment Day 2022. The collection of papers selected by Dr Dan Evans is available here: https://bsssjournals. onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2389. world-environment-day Soils are one of the most significant components of terrestrial environments. They deliver an array of supporting, regulatory and provisioning roles across multiple spatial and temporal scales. It was therefore essential that soils—their diversity, their multifunctionality, and their complex and dynamic relationships with other ecosystems—were celebrated on annual World Environment Day, held this year on Sunday 5th June. Led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the theme of the 2022 World Environment Day was “Only One Earth”. It called for collective, transformative action on a global scale to celebrate, protect and restore our planet. Confronted with ongoing and, in some cases, accelerating rates of land degradation and soil erosion, this year’s theme was particularly relevant to soils. It acted as a reminder that, in human timeframes, soils are non-renewable, and that global efforts are needed to conserve them for future generations. #OnlyOneEarth This Thematic Virtual Issue of the European Journal of Soil Science serves to spotlight the importance of soil across a wide range of terrestrial environments, and to showcase the multifarious functions that soils play within these systems. The papers that have been curated for this Virtual Issue demonstrate that soil properties and processes are not only eclectic and often specialist across space and time, but that they are, to various degrees, sensitive to change, be it a short-term perturbation event (e.g. extreme weather episodes), or a longterm shift in the environment (e.g. climate change). Moreover, it will remain clear throughout reading the Virtual Issue that to bring about this “transformative action on a global scale to celebrate, protect, and restore our planet”, we must first advance our understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes in soils, how these govern soil functions, and how they react to, and interact, with environmental changes imposed upon them. The significance of soils at a continental scale, and how soil functions are modulated across contrasting climatic regimes and land management practices, is exemplified at the beginning of this Virtual Issue by Zwetsloot et al. (2021). This study represents one of the first to assess and monitor soil multifunctionality across Europe. Critically, whilst multifunctionality in soil can be achieved, the authors suggest that constraints and trade-offs do exist. In the spirit of World Environment Day, the paper serves as a fitting reminder that finding solutions to protect and restore all terrestrial ecosystems simultaneously may be overly optimistic, and that optimization polices may be more effective. Noted by Zwetsloot et al. (2021) as one of the functions delivered less frequently at high capacity across Europe, protecting and restoring biodiversity is critical across many environments, globally. Soil biodiversity in particular is often sacrificed for primary productivity and nutrient cycling, as demonstrated by Vazquez et al. (2021). Here, the authors show that a careful application of pesticides and fertilisers can address this trade-off and increase soil multifunctionality, a point which is also reiterated by Shi et al. (2020) in their field-based study of the impact of long-term fertilisation on soil fungal assemblies. Land management changes can therefore play a role in governing below-ground communities, alongside long-term climatic changes. However, as Shen et al. (2020) reveals, some soil biology can acclimatise. Under a long-term warming experiment in a steppe ecosystem, the authors found that soil heterotrophic respiration acclimated to long-term warming via modifying the constitution of cell membranes. Meanwhile, the impacts of changing climatic conditions on soil macrofauna are illustrated in Singh et al. (2021) who find that seasonality plays a seminal role in modulating the effects of future climate change. The need to advance our understanding of soil chemistry to better manage terrestrial environments is also highlighted here. Part of that advancement requires improved monitoring infrastructure, as showcased by Corwin (2021) who demonstrates how proximal sensors and remote imagery can be used to assess soil salinity on dryland agricultural soils.

Looking back on the last year, I would like to thank the global measurement community for their continued support for Measurement Science and Technology. This year has been another successful year for the journal. Both our submission and acceptance rates have increased as well as the number of articles downloaded having increased by nearly 20%. The impact factor has increased to 2.398. Our Editorial Team is mindful of authors’ desire to publish work as quickly as possible while still ensuring work undergoes a rigorous refereeing process. With this in mind, the articles are published online with a DOI within 24 hours of acceptance. As ever we have continued to publish topical reviews giving comprehensive overviews of areas of measurement. This year we have published eleven reviews covering a wide range of topics: electromechanical resonators for sensing fluid density and viscosity, high speed imaging for x-ray computer tomography, seismography, thermometry, aeroacoustics, magnetic position sensing, digital holography, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) supporting geotechnical monitoring and nanotechnology used for sensing SARS-CoV-2. The breadth of topics strongly reflects not only the diversity of the journal, but also exemplifies a common theme of excellence in measurement science. Our Special Issues have also been popular. This year they have covered, metrology for additive manufacturing, acoustics in measurement, industrial vision and automation, measurement-based decision making in structural health monitoring, pressure-sensitive and temperature-sensitive paints for measuring high speed and unsteady flows. The Special Issue on metrology in manufacturing highlighted the industrial importance of metrology. The journal has also continued to publish a few design notes describing small pieces of work. A collection of six Emerging Leaders articles have been published bringing together work from some of the best early-career researchers in measurement and metrology [1–6]. This year also saw the publication of our first road map [7]. It covered the important area of signal processing for next generation measurement systems; something that relates to almost every area of measurement. This road map was followed up by a successful webinar where several authors gave presentations on their contributions. A road map on imaging is in preparation for publication in 2023. As with previous years, awards were made for Outstanding Papers [8]. This year awards were presented in the areas of optical and laser-based techniques [9], sensors and sensing systems [10], precision measurement [11] and fluid mechanics [12].",Measurement science and technology,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6501/ac9995', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1361-6501/ac9995?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6501/ac9995, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 days before this admission, when he noticed several itchy white “bumps” around the anus that subsequently evolved into ulcerative lesions. The next day, he sought evaluation at a primary care clinic of another hospital. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were performed. An injection of penicillin G benzathine was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir was started. During the next 5 days, the perianal ulcers did not abate, and the patient stopped taking valacyclovir. Painful proctitis with rectal bleeding and malodorous, mucopurulent discharge developed, along with fever, chills, drenching sweats, and new tender swelling in the groin. Three days before this admission, a new painless ulcer appeared on the penis that was similar in appearance to the perianal ulcers. Two days before this admission, new scattered vesicular lesions appeared on the arms and legs, and the patient presented to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital for evaluation. Additional history was obtained from the patient. Fourteen years before this evaluation, sore throat and upper body rash developed; he received a diagnosis of secondary syphilis and was treated with penicillin G benzathine. He also had a history of recurrent oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, for which he was treated intermittently with valacyclovir. He took daily oral emtricitabine and tenofovir for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a suburban area of Massachusetts with two roommates and a cat. Two weeks before this evaluation, he had traveled to an urban area of southeastern Canada. During this trip, he had had sex with male partners without the use of barrier protection. There was no other recent travel. The patient did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol rarely.

1888d23395931994cef9138b40b270718035ce77,2022: A Challenging Year for LIMUJ,"2022 was a transition year for the Libyan International Medical University Journal (LIMUJ). The transfer process from our old publisher (Medknow) to our new publisher (Thieme) was not smooth and took longer than expected. Besides, we were faced with many difficulties at the beginning that resulted in a loss of communication with many of our authors, readers, and referees; we apologize to them for any inconveniences they faced in reconnection with LIMUJ. However, our train now is back on track, and we hope for a smooth fast ride toward our goals.1 With Thieme, we have received 16 articles (excluding the editorials), 3 were rejected before review, two were rejected after review, and 11 articles were accepted after review with an acceptance rate of approximately 69%. The average review time from the first submission to the final decision was 33.6 days, and the average handling time after acceptance till article publication was 32.7 days.

All plenary reports in their own way were interesting and relevant. Prof. M. Nodzynska-Moron’s report was dedicated to non-formal natural science education realities. Various practical examples were presented, non-formal natural science education experiences were analysed. Prof. M. Bilek analysed chemistry didactics issues in his report. A special attention was paid to virtual chemistry experiments, as well as to experiments using computer tools. Prof. A. James discussed the implementation of STEM programme while working with primary school teachers. Preparation and practical implementation aspects of such programme were analysed, concrete educational experiences were presented. 
In the first section, the reports were mainly devoted to the problems of pre-school, primary and general natural science education. A total of 9 reports were presented. In the second section, issues of natural science and technological education in gymnasium and in higher education institutions were discussed. A total of 10 reports were presented. It is interesting that in the second section, three reports of foreign researchers were presented.
The topics of the research were diverse, basically various areas of natural science and technological education were discussed. It is important that the participants were active, intense discussions and sharing of experiences took place. The results of the ongoing international project “Bridge2Teach” were presented at the conference. More information about this project can be found on the project website (https://www.bridge2teach-project.eu). Various natural science education topics were presented in other reports.
On the second day of the conference, a seminar was held for natural science teachers “Integrated science education in Lithuania: achievements and future perspectives” (The project is funded by the Lithuanian Science Council No. P-REP-21-8).

d1d27aa4eecedb4f830238fe827b05e3c5356a6b,Deep Learning for Intelligent Human–Computer Interaction,"In recent years, gesture recognition and speech recognition, as important input methods in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI), have been widely used in the field of virtual reality. In particular, with the rapid development of deep learning, artificial intelligence, and other computer technologies, gesture recognition and speech recognition have achieved breakthrough research progress. The search platform used in this work is mainly the Google Academic and literature database Web of Science. According to the keywords related to HCI and deep learning, such as “intelligent HCI”, “speech recognition”, “gesture recognition”, and “natural language processing”, nearly 1000 studies were selected. Then, nearly 500 studies of research methods were selected and 100 studies were finally selected as the research content of this work after five years (2019–2022) of year screening. First, the current situation of the HCI intelligent system is analyzed, the realization of gesture interaction and voice interaction in HCI is summarized, and the advantages brought by deep learning are selected for research. Then, the core concepts of gesture interaction are introduced and the progress of gesture recognition and speech recognition interaction is analyzed. Furthermore, the representative applications of gesture recognition and speech recognition interaction are described. Finally, the current HCI in the direction of natural language processing is investigated. The results show that the combination of intelligent HCI and deep learning is deeply applied in gesture recognition, speech recognition, emotion recognition, and intelligent robot direction. A wide variety of recognition methods were proposed in related research fields and verified by experiments. Compared with interactive methods without deep learning, high recognition accuracy was achieved. In Human–Machine Interfaces (HMIs) with voice support, context plays an important role in improving user interfaces. Whether it is voice search, mobile communication, or children’s speech recognition, HCI combined with deep learning can maintain better robustness. The combination of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks can greatly improve the accuracy and precision of action recognition. Therefore, in the future, the application field of HCI will involve more industries and greater prospects are expected.",Applied Sciences,2022.0,65,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/22/11457/pdf?version=1668165580', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/app122211457?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/app122211457, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

bf74b72959206d6883bf11b3417ac235d7c25f36,A Transformative Project between Two-State Colleges and a-4-year Institution for Student Success in STEM,"The session will report on the success and lessons learned from the five-year implementation of a collaborative DOE project between two Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) State Colleges and an HSI university with a combined 140,000+ undergraduate students. The session will also report on revising a Systemic, Evidenced-Based, and Student-Centered (SE-SC) framework due to the COVID-19 situation over the last two years. The original aim of the SE-SC framework was to maximize the number of academically-talented, Hispanic students who complete their AA degrees at State Colleges and transfer to a 4-year institution to complete their BS degree and are career-ready to enter engineering and computer science (ECS). The revised SE-SC framework addresses the online education challenge of the project due to the COVID-19 situation. The session will report on how the professional relationships among three large post-secondary institutions have evolved and how the partners have become more intentional about project outcomes. In addition, the design and implementation of articulation agreements have increased programmatic alignment, a more seamless and easy-to-navigate transfer process for students. Furthermore, the collaboration to reach out to industry partners has increased the authenticity of experiences provided to the students across all three institutions. The session will also report on the faculty's adaptation of their instructional practices to include using newer digital technologies for hybrid and remote learning while maximizing student interests and motivating degree completion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Project success has been assessed by applying quantitative and qualitative measures, informal assessments, and anecdotal records. The institutional infrastructure in supporting diverse student interests and success in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Computer Science degree programs and their career pathways are presented. Other institutions interested in promoting STEM programs may replicate the implemented model due to its effectiveness, as reported in the session. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/41499.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41499?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41499, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

360c886d1b5a94d2e18c470b14a7d5bbb79db1dd,A Systematic Review of the Applications of Multi-Criteria Decision Aid Methods (1977–2022),"Multicriteria methods have gained traction in academia and industry practices for effective decision-making. This systematic review investigates and presents an overview of multi-criteria approaches research conducted over forty-four years. The Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases were searched for papers on multi-criteria methods with titles, abstracts, keywords, and articles from January 1977 to 29 April 2022. Using the R Bibliometrix tool, the bibliographic data was evaluated. According to this bibliometric analysis, in 131 countries over the past forty-four years, 33,201 authors have written 23,494 documents on multi-criteria methods. This area’s scientific output increases by 14.18 percent every year. China has the highest percentage of publications at 18.50 percent, followed by India at 10.62 percent and Iran at 7.75 percent. Islamic Azad University has the most publications with 504, followed by Vilnius Gediminas Technical University with 456 and the National Institute of Technology with 336. Expert Systems With Applications, Sustainability, and the Journal of Cleaner Production are the top journals, accounting for over 4.67 percent of all indexed works. In addition, E. Zavadskas and J. Wang have the most papers in the multi-criteria approaches sector. AHP, followed by TOPSIS, VIKOR, PROMETHEE, and ANP, is the most popular multi-criteria decision-making method among the ten nations with the most publications in this field. The bibliometric literature review method enables researchers to investigate the multi-criteria research area in greater depth than the conventional literature review method. It allows a vast dataset of bibliographic records to be statistically and systematically evaluated, producing insightful insights.

c4a3a9bb2dfba38d3dc689438c50f3e5bbf64e4d,The TAS Test project: a prospective longitudinal validation of new online motor-cognitive tests to detect preclinical Alzheimer’s disease and estimate 5-year risks of cognitive decline and dementia,"Background The worldwide prevalence of dementia is rapidly rising. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), accounts for 70% of cases and has a 10–20-year preclinical period, when brain pathology covertly progresses before cognitive symptoms appear. The 2020 Lancet Commission estimates that 40% of dementia cases could be prevented by modifying lifestyle/medical risk factors. To optimise dementia prevention effectiveness, there is urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD for targeted risk reduction. Current preclinical AD tests are too invasive, specialist or costly for population-level assessments. We have developed a new online test, TAS Test, that assesses a range of motor-cognitive functions and has capacity to be delivered at significant scale. TAS Test combines two innovations: using hand movement analysis to detect preclinical AD, and computer-human interface technologies to enable robust ‘self-testing’ data collection. The aims are to validate TAS Test to [1] identify preclinical AD, and [2] predict risk of cognitive decline and AD dementia. Methods Aim 1 will be addressed through a cross-sectional study of 500 cognitively healthy older adults, who will complete TAS Test items comprising measures of motor control, processing speed, attention, visuospatial ability, memory and language. TAS Test measures will be compared to a blood-based AD biomarker, phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181). Aim 2 will be addressed through a 5-year prospective cohort study of 10,000 older adults. Participants will complete TAS Test annually and subtests of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB) biennially. 300 participants will undergo in-person clinical assessments. We will use machine learning of motor-cognitive performance on TAS Test to develop an algorithm that classifies preclinical AD risk (p-tau181-defined) and determine the precision to prospectively estimate 5-year risks of cognitive decline and AD. Discussion This study will establish the precision of TAS Test to identify preclinical AD and estimate risk of cognitive decline and AD. If accurate, TAS Test will provide a low-cost, accessible enrichment strategy to pre-screen individuals for their likelihood of AD pathology prior to more expensive tests such as blood or imaging biomarkers. This would have wide applications in public health initiatives and clinical trials. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05194787 , 18 January 2022.

4b7b34f319dfdf3e9e08dd4ae16bc05b90130fe4,Prevalence of dental caries in the permanent dentition amongst 12-year-olds in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Dental caries (DC) is highly prevalent condition affecting mostly young children. There has been no systematic review done on the prevalence of DC amongst 12-year -olds in Africa. Although some African countries have reported a decrease in DC prevalence, others have shown an increase and it is essential to measure current trends in order to identify strategies and programmes that could assist in reducing DC in Africa. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence of DC (condition) amongst the permanent dentition of 12-year-old children (population) in Africa (context). Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. Peer reviewed cross-sectional articles from January 2000 until December 2021 was searched and this included the following databases: Pubmed (Medline); SCOPUS; CINAHL (via EBSCOhost); Academic Search Complete (via EBSCOhost); Dentistry and Oral Sciences Sources (via EBSCOhost); and Science Direct. The search was last updated on the 10th January 2022. Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools were used to assess risk of bias. Prevalence figures were stratified by Urban/Rural status, country and time using a random-effects model. All studies performed on children 12-year-olds on the African continent were included. The prevalence of DC and the DMFT scores were the primary and secondary outcome measures, respectively. Only articles consisting of 12-year-old children who reside in Africa were included in this study. The systematic review was registered with Prospero CRD42021293666. Results 18,080 participants were included in this review. A total of thirty studies were included in the review. The pooled effect size of dental caries severity was 1.09 (CI 0.91–1.27) and the overall prevalence was 36% (CI 29.4–41.7%). Eritrea (78%) had the highest prevalence of DC while Zambia had the lowest (11%); Eritrea also had the highest DMFT score (2.5) with Sudan having the lowest score (0.49). Urban cities had the highest DMFT score (1.32, CI 0.97–1.68), compared to rural cities (1.13, CI 0.86–1.4) and there was an increasing trend in DC prevalence over time from 28% (CI 23–34%) in 2000 to 2005 to 57% (CI 43–72%) in studies conducted after 2015. The risk of bias was very low where majority of the studies scored more than 50% in the JBI critical appraisal tool.

With the development of related research, the relationship between NETs and diseases such as sepsis, cancer, and systemic lupus erythematosus has received close attention. However, there is a lack of reports that comprehensively and objectively present the current status of NETs-related studies. Therefore, this study aims to visually analyze the current status and trends of NETs-related research by means of bibliometrics and knowledge mapping. Methods NETs-related articles and reviews were retrieved using the Web of Science core collection subject search, and bibliometric analysis was performed in Excel 365, CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix (R-Tool of R-Studio). Results A total of 4866 publications from 2004 to 2022 were included in the bibliometric analysis. The number of publications shows an increasing trend from year to year. Collaborative network analysis shows that the United States and Germany are the most influential countries in this field, with the highest number of publications and citations. The journal with the most publications is Frontiers in Immunology. Brinkmann Volker is an authoritative author in this field, and his publication “Neutrophil extracellular traps kill bacteria” is the most frequently cited. The literature and keyword analysis shows that the relationship between NETs and diseases (hematological diseases, sepsis, cancer, etc.) and cell death (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, etc.) is a popular research topic. Currently, NETs and SARS-CoV-2-related studies are at the forefront of the field. Conclusion This study is the first to visualize the research in NETs-related fields using bibliometric methods, revealing the trends and frontiers of NETs research.

Methods: Publications associated with the treatment of liver fibrosis were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection on 16 April 2022. CiteSpace 5.8.R3 and VOSviewer 1.6.18 were calculated to perform bibliometric and knowledge-map analysis. Results: A total of 72,686 authors from 200 institutions in 134 countries/regions published 15,237 studies in different academic journals. United States was the most productive country, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University was the most published institution. Trauner Michael had the most published articles, whereas Scott L. Friedman was the most frequently co-cited author. Moreover, there was frequent inter-institution cooperation between countries in the years 2015 and after, but the before years showed rare inter-institution cooperation. The journal HEPATOLOGY was both the most published publication and the most frequently co-cited one in this field. Screened keywords, such as virus infection, inflammation, oxidative stress, activation of hepatic stellate cell (HSC), and hepatocellular apoptosis, could be both therapeutic targets and pathological mechanisms in terms of liver fibrosis. Furthermore, long-term suppression of hepatitis B virus replication and the activation of HSC were the latest hotspots and topics related to the treatment of liver fibrosis. Besides, the treatments of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis were also involved in the treatment of liver fibrosis, which were both emerging topics and rapidly developing hot fields. Conclusion: This bibliometric analysis conducted a full overview of the treatment of liver fibrosis, which provided important clues and ideas for scholars focusing on this field.

22e5e1482b43dc61dcbbe54fa0e368e9cfe3f806,"Crop year, harvest date and clone effects on fruit characteristics, chemical composition and olive oil stability from an Empeltre clonal selection grown in Aragon","Abstract BACKGROUND In this study, the effects of crop year, harvest date and clone on the fruit characteristics and chemical composition of Empeltre olive oils were evaluated. For this purpose, the weight and oil content of fruit and the fatty acid composition, polyphenol content and oxidative stability of the olive oil was analysed throughout ripening during three successive seasons. RESULTS The weight and moisture in the fruit, as well as the fatty acids and polyphenol content in the olive oil, were mainly affected by crop year. In contrast, the stability was strongly influenced by the harvest date. Both factors had an influence on the fruit's oil content. The clone was not a substantial component in terms of variability, although the interaction with crop year was notable for some of the characteristics. The oil content increased significantly along with the harvest date and reached maximum values in the last period (44.9%). Conversely, stability and polyphenols decreased significantly (depending on the year, by 30–70%) from October to December, reaching the highest mean values between 1 October and 10 November (15.5 h; 500 mg caffeic acid kg−1). Oleic acid and monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFA/PUFA) did not show significant differences depending on the harvest date, but between years, with 2018 having the highest percentage of oleic acid (72.72%) and MUFA/PUFA (8.38). CONCLUSION Early harvesting of Empeltre olives would provide considerably more stable olive oils, regardless of the clone selected, with higher phenolic content. It would not affect the MUFA/PUFA ratio, mainly influenced by the crop year. © 2022 The Authors.

RESULTS Simple sugar and anthocyanin content increased with maturation but total acidity and flavonoids content decreased, and cinnamic acids did not show a clear trend. Climatic conditions seem to have a decisive influence on the elderberry maturation, namely the total number of hot (>30 °C) days. The PAL, PPO, and POD activity can explain the differences observed in elderberry phenolic content. CONCLUSION These results highlighted the influence of climatic conditions in each harvesting season on elderberry development and quality. © 2022 The Authors.

Signed by Director Alondra Nelson, this updated guidance eliminated the 12-month embargo period on publications arising from U.S. federal funding that had been allowed from a previous 2013 OSTP memo. Although reactions to this updated federal guidance have been plentiful, to date there has not been a detailed analysis of the publications that would fall under this new framework. The OSTP released a companion report along with the memo, but it only provided a broad estimate of total numbers affected per year. Therefore, this study seeks to more deeply investigate the characteristics of U.S. federally funded research over a 5-year period from 2017–2021 to better understand the updated guidance’s impact. It uses a manually created custom filter in the Dimensions database to return only publications that arise from U.S. federal funding. Results show that an average of 265,000 articles were published each year that acknowledge US federal funding agencies, and these research outputs are further examined by publisher, journal title, institutions, and Open Access status.

It is of interest to review how the sustainable development index has evolved according to the global fulfillment of the development goals (SDGs) in the world (2000-2022). It was found that since the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and subsequently the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were proposed, the greatest increase in the index was reported in periods prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Among the continents, the European continent is positioned with the highest SDGs index values, mainly the countries of Finland, Sweden, and Denmark (≥ 85 points).

Computer-aided translation (CAT) provides a promising solution to yield a high-quality translation with a guarantee. Unfortunately, due to the lack of popular benchmarks, the research on CAT is not well developed compared with machine translation. In this year, we hold a new shared task called Word-level AutoCompletion (WLAC) for CAT in WMT. Specifically, we introduce some resources to train a WLAC model, and particularly we collect data from CAT systems as a part of test data for this shared task.

In recent years, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), a new class of drugs, has shown good therapeutic effects on CVD patients in several clinical studies, reducing the morbidity and mortality of CVD patients. In this study, we retrieved publications on ARNI research in the cardiovascular field from the Web of Science core collection and analyzed the annual output, spatial and temporal distribution, institutions and authors, core journals, keywords and co-cited literature based on CiteSpace. As a result, 604 publications were retrieved, and the number of annual publications generally increased year by year, with the largest number of articles. The analysis of the co-occurrence of output countries and authors showed that a few developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom are the most active in this field, forming academic groups represented by John Joseph Valentine McMurray and Scott D. Solomon, and New England Journal of Medicine, Cirulation, and Journal of the American College of Cardiology are the most popular journals in the field, with research hotspots focused on ARNI in the treatment of total ejection fraction heart failure, hypertension and its target organ damage, with the potential for future benefit throughout the cardiovascular event chain as research progresses.

We aimed to evaluate the survival of GC in China from 2000 to 2022 through a nationwide systematic review of hospital-based studies and to identify whether hospital-based studies show higher survival rates than population-based studies. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Chinese databases of CNKI and Wanfang for hospital-based studies on GC survival published between January 1, 2000, and January 20, 2022. We calculated the nationwide GC survival rate (SR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) and conducted subgroup analyses on histologic type, subsite, tumour node metastasis (TNM) stage, therapy type, study design, and participant region. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD-42019121559). Results The initial literature search returned 36 613 publications, among which 664 studies (180 798 participants) matched the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled one-, two-, three- and five-year SRs of GC were 75.4% (95% CI = 74.0%-76.8%), 54.3% (95% CI = 50.1%-58.6%), 53.4% (95% CI = 50.4%-56.4%), and 44.5% (95% CI = 41.5%-47.5%), respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed an increase in three- and five-year SRs from 2006 to 2022. The five-year SR was highest among patients without lymph node metastasis (pooled SR = 67.8%, 95% CI = 62.8%-72.7%) and lowest among those with distant metastasis (pooled SR = 8.4%, 95% CI = 5.1%-11.7%).

Even so, results from these and subsequent clinical trials showed efficacy and tolerability. Based on the phase 3 results and additional preclinical investigations, Forteo (teriparatide) was approved for use in the United States with an indication for the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at high risk for fracture, a boxed warning regarding potential risk of osteosarcoma, a 2‐year lifetime limitation of use, other risk mitigations, and a requirement to assess for risk of osteosarcoma in humans treated with teriparatide. Subsequent investigations included five real‐world studies directed at assessing a connection between teriparatide and osteosarcoma risk in humans. The early studies did not identify an increased risk of osteosarcoma but were inadequate to sufficiently characterize risk, given the low incidence of this rare form of bone cancer. Learning from these efforts, two studies were undertaken using claims data to identify large cohorts of patients treated with teriparatide and assess whether these patients were found to have osteosarcoma by linking pharmacy claims data with data from cancer registries. These studies showed no increase in osteosarcoma in patients using teriparatide compared with unexposed groups, as well as to the expected population‐based background incidence of the disease. Based on this real‐world evidence and the totality of data collected from postmarketing use and other clinical investigations, the label was updated in 2020. The changes included addition of information from large observational studies using real‐world evidence, removal of the boxed warning, and a revision of the 2‐year lifetime limitation. Thus, observational studies with large sample sizes using real‐world data can provide supportive evidence to facilitate regulatory decisions including the elimination of a boxed warning. © 2022 Eli Lilly and Company.

0ad42e1598c1cf18880b412e021a04df36ac7419,JPR starts 2022 with a new design -Towards a new frontier in prosthodontics.,"As the Journal of Prosthodontic Research (JPR) enters 2022, I sincerely thank all authors, reviewers and readers in our community as well as the editorial team members for their continuous support despite these difficult times in the COVID-19 pandemic. The first issue of the year provides an exciting opportunity to start something new or introduce changes. On behalf of the Editorial Committee Members, I am happy to announce that the front cover of the JPR has been renewed (Fig. 1). Along with this update, a new design has been also introduced to all articles in this issue. The simplified design based on green, the journal color, represents our commitment to a fresh start while cherishing tradition. I would like to use this opportunity to thank the public relations team of the committee, especially Dr. Sayaka Tada, for their great contribution to the renewal. The COVID-19 pandemic has unavoidably changed our life and work styles in academia, and in dental practices as well. While the pandemic is not over, a new beginning is now in sight. Compared to last year, I believe that it will be much easier for us to positively move ahead with a “new normal” in 2022. This new normal results from the establishment of evidence-based risk management of COVID-19 and the implementation of widespread vaccination, particularly for healthcare personnel. In the first issue of this year, a broad-spectrum review by Yonenaga et al. describes the characteristics of COVID-19 from a dental perspective [1]. In addition, Nagarsekar et al. provide a timely and informative letter to the editor on trends in patient attendance and complaints for prosthodontic treatments during the pre-pandemic, lockdown and unlock periods in India [2]. These articles could contribute to new standards in prosthodontics to prevent recurrences of such challenging situations for dental services in future pandemics. The pandemic has also inspired us through the emergence of digital transformation (DX), which is the process of using digital technologies to create new values. A simple example is found in web and video conferencing. We never thought before the pandemic that all social activities in academia could be conducted in digital formats. Social distancing measures have caused us naturally adapt ourselves to virtualization through technology, including not only online conferences for research and educational activities, but also teledentistry for effective exchange of clinical information over remote distances, used in consultation and treatment planning for patients [3]. Through this process, we have more clearly realized the usefulness and importance of digital databases representing clinical settings for dental healthcare and treatments. In this regard, it should be noted that prosthodontics should be one of the most suitable medical fields for DX initiatives. Indeed, current prosthodontic treatments are closely related to digital dentistry. This issue of JPR contains several topics covering digital technologies, such as digital impression [4] and computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) [5] for digital dentures, implant computer-guided surgery [6] and 3D printing [7]. In addition, a review article by Kishimoto et al. on dental applications of artificial intelligence (AI) [8] illustrates the dawning of a new era, in which digital data provide effective diagnosis and suitable treatment planning for future prosthodontic treatments. In the Editorial of the last issue, Prof. Kazuyoshi Baba, the current President of the Japan Prosthodontic Society, posited that prosthodontics could generate new value through AI analysis of patient “big data”, thus contributing to quality of life in the emerging superaged society through “database-driven prosthodontics” [9]. I do hope we will shift our mindset to recognize that the “new normal” in prosthodontics actually now provides a chance to create and accelerate a new paradigm through DX. As Editor-in-Chief, I would like to devote myself to the JPR’s contribution to new standards in step with global society as an international public asset [10]. Lastly, on behalf of the committee members, I wish you and your loved ones a happy and healthy 2022 with much professional success. Thank you for growing and building the JPR with us.",Journal of Prosthodontic Research,2022.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jpr/66/1/66_JPR_66_1_ed/_pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2186/jpr.JPR_66_1_ed?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2186/jpr.JPR_66_1_ed, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

aeed774d31c807d97867ef5afc5d9eb418820c4c,Second-Year Review of the NSF-DoD REU Site: HYPER,"The challenges associated with achieving hypersonic flight, developing advanced propulsion systems, and designing reusable launch platforms are strongly interdisciplinary. Exposing undergraduate students to interdisciplinary research is recognized as a means to equip society's future engineers and scientists with the broad skillset necessary to contribute to these areas. The jointly funded NSF-DoD REU site Advanced Technologies for Hypersonic Propulsive, Energetic and Reusable Platforms (HYPER) unites multidisciplinary interests to study advanced structures and systems with application to hypersonics, space, propulsion, and energy. Over the course of two 10-week summer sessions (2019 and 2021), participants have gained hands-on training in contemporary challenges such as: (1) utilizing advanced manufacturing techniques for high-value components, (2) integrating in situ monitoring of stress-strain evolution, (3) developing novel methods for improved internal cooling and heat transfer effectiveness, (4) mitigating flutter through advanced rotor dynamic control, etc. Eleven research projects have been crafted to engage students in PhD-level topics. Many of these challenges rely on approaches that cut across disciplines and research techniques (e.g., experiments and computer simulation). The present reporting serves as a synopsis of challenges, advances, and lessons learned conducting the research thus far. The site HYPER has six core objectives that relate to: (1) preparing students for graduate school and/or research-oriented careers, (2) fostering technical skills in student participants, (3) improving participants' communication skills, (4) marketing to and recruiting a diverse group of participants, and more. Assessment of the program outcomes according to these objectives are reported here with data gathered after two years. Program outcomes were conducted with an external evaluator affiliated within the University of Central Florida's Program Evaluation and Educational Research Group (PEER). Results demonstrate a very effective site with strongly positive outcomes for all participants. Insights are provided so this research effort may be confirmed by other independent sites. It should be noted that the 2020 session was postponed out of an abundance of caution based on the uncertain and evolving conditions facilitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/42076.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--42076?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--42076, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fb21c155d026dcd2f1d64857ec0a0169fed10998,Science Mapping for Nutrition Education in Sports Recovery Research: A Bibliometric Analysis,"This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the literature on sports nutrition as recovery published between 1964 and 2022. This study illustrates the structure and trends in sports nutrition publications by using scientific mapping and analyzing publication performance. This study identified the contributions of authors, journals, countries, and widely cited articles. While there was no massive expansion in the first year of publication, the results show that high growth emerged in the 2010s. Several countries have made significant contributions to recovery research in sports nutrition. European countries account for the majority of publications on this subject. Latin American and Asian countries are also keeping an eye on the study's growth. Another finding is that various multidisciplinary publishers publish articles about sports nutrition. The International Journal of Sports Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, on the other hand, is the journal that publishes the most articles. Burke L.M. has established himself as a prolific writer in this field, producing many documents and total citations. Several keywords have large nodes associated with their frequency of occurrence.

bdd35e7b1a1c2f2bd72c48065ad4ba91b06e31f1,Research progress of E-cigarette-A bibliometric analysis during 2010–2022,"Introduction Electronic cigarettes have been widely used all over the world. It is not clear what the advantages and disadvantages of a novelty in daily life are that is attracting increasing attention. Up to now, no bibliometric studies on e-cigarettes have been published in databases. Therefore, we are willing to explore directions and research hotspots in this emerging field by using bibliometrics to analyze research areas, publishing countries and institutions, high-output authors, and future trends of e-cigarettes in recent years. Compared with the traditional review, the bibliometric study can provide some information on core journals, articles, researchers, institutions, and countries concentrating on this topic to guide experimentation strategies and funding decisions. Methods A bibliometric analysis was performed by CiteSpace and VOSviewer up to April 2022 in the core collection of Web of Science. HistCite, VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and the R-based Bibliometrix 4.1.0 packages were used to analyze literature information, including year, journal, country, institute, author, keywords, and co-cited references. Results Research related to e-cigarettes has proliferated since its inception around 2010. A total of 2,302 studies were published in 689 journals by our search method. Nicotine and tobacco research was the most published journal. The most prolific country was the United States, while the most influential institution was Virginia Commonwealth University. Eight of the top ten authors were from the United States. Oxidative stress, high school students, smoking cessation, delivery, behavioral economics, and exposure were the top topics. Conclusions As an emerging social phenomenon, research on e-cigarettes has increased significantly over the past decade, particularly from 2015 to 2020. The top three core journals are Nicotine and Tobacco Research, the International Journal of Environmental Research, and Public Health. Eisenberg-Thomas had published numerous articles on e-cigarettes that had been co-cited in many papers. Oxidative stress, high school students, and smoking cessation are the top three areas of e-cigarette-related research, which were also important areas for further investigation.",Frontiers in Public Health,2022.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.928059/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9376676, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6dfe6673adb51e4dc6688cf4ac2d949e84829886,DiSSCo Flanders: A regional natural science collections management infrastructure in an international context,"DiSSCo Flanders aims at developing a standardised natural science collections management infrastructure, ensuring proper long-term conservation, and future re-usage of the collections. Meise Botanic Garden coordinates the Flemish consortium. This four-year project, funded by the FWO (Research Foundation – Flanders), started in January 2021. 
 The consortium brings together both the more classical ‘museum’ collections (Meise Botanic Garden, Ghent University Museum), with research collections (Research Institute for Nature and Forest, Flanders Research Institute for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Flanders Marine Institute, universities), and living collections (Belgian Association of Botanic Gardens and Arboreta, Zoo of Antwerp (Poo 2022)). Many of the research collections are smaller orphan collections, lacking a (full-time) curator, for which collection management is not the core business of the hosting institute. The Belgian federal DiSSCo members are associated with the project, allowing close collaboration between European, national and regional (digital) collection management inititatives.
 Building on the expertise of the European DiSSCo-related projects, an initial high-level inventory and assessment of the collections has been made and will provide a better understanding of the collections landscape in Flanders (Van Baelen 2022). This step in the digitization will increase the findability of the diverse regional collections and highlight the available knowledge to the research community. Close collaboration with the TDWG Collections Descriptions interest group and the development of the Latimer Core standard (Woodburn 2021) will ensure maximal interoperability of the collection data.
 In order to be relevant for research, the Flemish collections need to be more interconnected and linked to other data sources. To ensure that collection data is adhering to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Resuable) and ready to connect to the DiSSCo research infrastructure, DiSSCo Flanders will have a large focus on the collection(s) management system (CMS). Depending on the needs and specificities of each collection, a strategy will be chosen to implement and/or collection data will be migrated to (an) optimised system(s).
 Parallel to the digital inventory and CMS choice, the consortium addresses specific themes in the format of working groups. Most of the institutes have identified that their molecular collection (DNA, tissues) has not been properly acknowledged as a separate long-term collection. Challenges such as the storage and curation of e-DNA and environmental samples (e.g., soil) have been identified.
 Very often it will only be feasible to add basic data in the CMS and essential data is not available to the researchers. DiSSCo Flanders invests in the enrichment of specimen data to ensure that a maximal amount of information becomes available to the community. This can be accomplished either through the use of citizen science/crowdsourcing using the DoeDat platform (Groom 2018), or by using machine learning techniques performed by the IDLab at Ghent University (Thirukokaranam Chandrasekar 2021). 
 Besides the technical aspects of the DiSSCo research infrastructure, the consortium is covering topics such as data publication, legal aspects of collections, standard operating procedures, etc. through knowledge sharing and active dialog.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2022.0,2,"{'url': 'https://biss.pensoft.net/article/94350/download/pdf/', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.6.94350?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.6.94350, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The descriptive-correlational design gathered relevant data to determine the relationship between learning readiness and the level of learning outcomes. Through a survey questionnaire, data were gathered from 273 Grade 11 students enrolled in a public High School during the School Year 2021-2022. Based on the results, the students are moderately ready in terms of self-knowledge, analyzing context, and activating knowledge. Similarly, they are also moderately ready in terms of designing learning pathways, clarifying knowledge, and apply understanding. Likewise, the respondents are at the level of moderately engaged in their learning outcomes in Science in modular distance modality as to knowledge in terms of content, process, and nature of science knowledge, and behavior and stewardship; as to skills in terms of science inquiry and self-efficacy; as to attitude in terms of interest and motivation. Finally, a significant relationship was found between learning readiness and the level of learning outcomes in Science in modular distance modality.

It also aimed to find out if the teachers’ role in developing school students’ creative thinking skills differed as per their work place (Jordan and Oman) and whether or not there were statistically significant differences at the significance level (0.05=α) in the teachers’ role in developing school students’ creative thinking skills from the perspective of teachers attributed to the variable of teaching experience. To achieve the study objectives, the descriptive survey approach was used through developing a questionnaire with 31 statements which was distributed to a sample of 140 teachers teaching science to grades 4 to 8 in public schools in Jordan and Sultanate of Oman in the academic year 2021 – 2022. 5- point Likert scale was used to analyze the data collected. The findings showed that primary education science teachers practiced creative thinking skills with their students to a high degree as the mean of their responses to the questionnaire statements was 3.43 with a standard deviation 1.12. There were no statistically significant differences in the science teachers’ response means in Jordan and Oman. However, there were statistically significant differences at the significance level (0.05=α) in the teachers’ response means in favor of the female teachers whose response mean was 4.25 which was higher than the male teachers’ response mean which was 3.35. This result might be attributed to a number of factors such as women in Arab societies try to prove themselves and try to prove that they are more distinguished than men.

6809db6203a2eb3586ed0452e5688794b1440b10,"John Rensenbrink, 1928–2022: In Memoriam","John Rensenbrink, a professor emeritus of political science at Bowdoin College, and a co-founder of the Green Party, passed away on July 30, 2022 at the age of 93. Rensenbrink’s life epitomized the values of scholar-activism as he was both an author of books on ecological politics and an influential political activist. Rensenbrink was born on August 30, 1928 in Pease, Minnesota, one of seven children born to a family of Dutch immigrant dairy farmers. He operated the family’s dairy farm after his father’s untimely death in 1943 and, as a result, John was not able to attend high school. Instead, he took correspondence courses, which allowed him to attend Calvin College (1946–1950) in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he graduated with a B.A. degree. In 1951, Rensenbrink earned a Master’s degree in political science from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He subsequently accepted a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the University of Amsterdam (1951–1952) and, upon returning to the United States, Rensenbrink attended the University of Chicago, where he received his Ph.D. in political science (1956) with an emphasis on political philosophy, American politics, and U.S. Constitutional law. In 1956, Rensenbrink began his academic career at Coe College in Iowa, but after a year he accepted a position at Williams College (1957–1961) in Massachusetts. In 1961, Rensenbrink moved to Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine to teach political philosophy and history. He remained at Bowdoin College until 1989, when he took early retirement to concentrate on organizing the Green Party. Rensenbrink began his career as a member of the Republican Party but his disgust with the politics of Joseph McCarthy and the appeal of Democratic U.S. Presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson convinced him to join the Democratic Party. By 1968, however, Rensenbrink was becoming disillusioned with the Democratic Party so he helped organize the Reform Democrats of Maine (1968–1970) for the purpose of ending the Vietnam War and democratizing the Democratic Party. Later, while visiting Poland in 1983, Rensenbrink learned of the West German Green Party, which had recently won seats in the country’s Bundestag.

dbfeb82aa3c644d0d8bcbca7d25bec138eefe491,Successfully Inverting the Classroom - Recommendations to Teach (fully online): Practical marginal conditions to succeed lecturing science implementing the inverted classroom method,"Inverting the classroom is a method to let students study the science of engineering materials on their own and then take time to discuss their questions and do extended hands-on lectures or exercises in class - or in the case of the covid-19 pandemic during plenary online sessions. First year mechanical engineering students use different materials to study and comprehend the principle underlying science in theory and then the plenary lectures offer the opportunity to apply their knowledge and transfer different aspects of material science to get the bigger picture. To meet the course learning outcome and overcome the diversity of a first year class many practical leads have to be fulfilled. Also, a sufficient number and variety of teaching materials, lecture videos, lightboard videos and micro-module lectures are provided aiming at different learning skills of the students. Students may individually choose, combine and study from alone or in study groups from a distance. Exercises, worked solutions, self-assessed tests and peer-instruction during present time help students to check on their learning progress. However, the self-study periods and (online) plenary sessions need to be guided carefully. If the inverted classroom teaching method follows a holistic approach it has been proven to be successful and increase the fun of learning (online) throughout the first year. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.

Stratego is one of the few iconic board games that artificial intelligence (AI) has not yet mastered. It is a game characterized by a twin challenge: It requires long-term strategic thinking as in chess, but it also requires dealing with imperfect information as in poker. The technique underpinning DeepNash uses a game-theoretic, model-free deep reinforcement learning method, without search, that learns to master Stratego through self-play from scratch. DeepNash beat existing state-of-the-art AI methods in Stratego and achieved a year-to-date (2022) and all-time top-three ranking on the Gravon games platform, competing with human expert players. Description Machine learning to play Stratego Stratego is a popular two-player imperfect information board game. Because of its complexity stemming from its enormous game tree, decision-making under imperfect information, and a piece deployment phase at the start, Stratego poses a challenge for artificial intelligence (AI). Previous computer programs only performed at an amateur level at best. Perolat et al. introduce a model-free multiagent reinforcement learning methodology and show that it can achieve human expert–level performance in Stratego. The present work not only adds to the growing list of games that AI systems can play as well or even better than humans but may also facilitate further applications of reinforcement learning methods in real-world, large-scale multiagent problems that are characterized by imperfect information and thus are currently unsolvable. —YS Reinforcement learning achieves human expert–level performance in the large-scale imperfect information board game Stratego.",Science,2022.0,180,"{'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.15378', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15378, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8afc0b761587ae05f2cc3406fbfadcfc30769dd4,Journey towards competency-based grading for mechanical engineering computer applications,"Over the past several years, increasing effort has been invested interrogating the very structure of assessment in higher education. In addition to a rising awareness of the mental health impacts of high-stakes assessment, questions have arisen around accessibility and equity in our assessment practices. From this conversation, the practice of competency-based or mastery-based education has become a hot topic in pedagogically minded circles. To summarize, competency-based assessment is the practice of developing targeted assessments and standards of performance for each individual skill or outcome present in the course and building an assessment scheme based on how many of those outcomes are sufficiently mastered in the allotted time. A defining trait of these schemes is the ability to repeat individual outcome assessments as needed to demonstrate mastery, significantly lowering the stakes of any individual attempt. Efforts have manifested at every level, up to and including entire mastery-based programs. In this work, the five-year-long reinvention of a mechanical engineering computer applications course is examined as it was transformed from traditional to flipped to competency-based, navigating the onset of COVID along the way. In the most recent iteration, the course involves a framework of repeatable assessments across an array of outcomes, including both traditional exam format assessment as well as more involved project-based assessments, a set of video modules, and a group project. The rationales for and lessons learned from this journey are explored, along with student comments and evaluations, and an examination of overall course grades and achievement of course outcomes. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/41349.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41349?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41349, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

46169fb4bc966b5c2faf90d0cafb0e7fa3e43544,Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer,"I October 2022, Cancer published part one of the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, which provides statistics on incidence and mortality rates across cancer types and demographics.1,2 The new report highlights the progress made in reducing the burden of cancer through advances in prevention, early detection, and treatments as well as the ongoing challenges in accelerating progress. The report holds no surprises, but the findings are a mixed bag of good and bad news according to Ahmedin Jemal, DVM, PhD, head of the Department of Surveillance and Health Equity Science at the American Cancer Society and the senior author of the report. The good news Overall, cancer mortality decreased during the most recent period, and incidence rates remained relatively stable for many cancer types. The report showed that between 2015 and 2019, overall cancer death rates fell by 2.3% per year for men and by 1.9% per year for women; these declines were seen for 11 of the 19 most common cancers in men and for 14 of the 20 most common cancers in women. Mortality also declined among children younger than 15 years and adolescents and young adults between the ages of 15 and 39 years, with an overall reduction in cancer mortality of 3.0% per year from 2001 to 2005. The largest declines in cancer death rates—more than 4% per year—occurred for lung cancer and melanoma because of the development and dissemination of targeted therapies and immunotherapies for these cancers over the past decade, says Dr Jemal. The decline in lung cancer mortality was the major contributor to the steep decline in overall cancer mortality during the most recent period. Another piece of good news is the decline in incidence rates for several common cancers in men and women. In women, incidence rates decreased for seven of the most common cancers (thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cancers of the brain and other nervous systems), with the largest decrease seen in thyroid cancer (2.9% per year). For men, incidence rates decreased for eight of the most common cancers (lung and bronchus cancer, laryngeal cancer, urinary bladder cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, cancers of the brain and other nervous systems, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and thyroid cancer), with the largest decreasing trend seen in lung cancer (2.6% per year).

e870f2bf2da081be3ef03d939ba871d9b6842655,Ambient air pollution and clinical dementia: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Objective To investigate the role of air pollutants in risk of dementia, considering differences by study factors that could influence findings. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Psycinfo, and OVID Medline from database inception through July 2022. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies that included adults (≥18 years), a longitudinal follow-up, considered US Environmental Protection Agency criteria air pollutants and proxies of traffic pollution, averaged exposure over a year or more, and reported associations between ambient pollutants and clinical dementia. Two authors independently extracted data using a predefined data extraction form and assessed risk of bias using the Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool. A meta-analysis with Knapp-Hartung standard errors was done when at least three studies for a given pollutant used comparable approaches. Results 2080 records identified 51 studies for inclusion. Most studies were at high risk of bias, although in many cases bias was towards the null. 14 studies could be meta-analysed for particulate matter <2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5). The overall hazard ratio per 2 μg/m3 PM2.5 was 1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.09). The hazard ratio among seven studies that used active case ascertainment was 1.42 (1.00 to 2.02) and among seven studies that used passive case ascertainment was 1.03 (0.98 to 1.07). The overall hazard ratio per 10 μg/m3 nitrogen dioxide was 1.02 ((0.98 to 1.06); nine studies) and per 10 μg/m3 nitrogen oxide was 1.05 ((0.98 to 1.13); five studies). Ozone had no clear association with dementia (hazard ratio per 5 μg/m3 was 1.00 (0.98 to 1.05); four studies). Conclusion PM2.5 might be a risk factor for dementia, as well as nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxide, although with more limited data. The meta-analysed hazard ratios are subject to limitations that require interpretation with caution. Outcome ascertainment approaches differ across studies and each exposure assessment approach likely is only a proxy for causally relevant exposure in relation to clinical dementia outcomes. Studies that evaluate critical periods of exposure and pollutants other than PM2.5, and studies that actively assess all participants for outcomes are needed. Nonetheless, our results can provide current best estimates for use in burden of disease and regulatory setting efforts.

9ba150032c324273ecc38a663c32a21c161e0cfc,Sustainable development goals: a bibliometric analysis of literature reviews,"The research in sustainable development goals (SDG) increases year by year since its approval in 2015. Typically, after a phase of exponential growth, the number of publications increases at lower rates, suggesting a consolidation process in which literature reviews become a relevant and high-evidence type of document. In this context, the aim of this study was to perform an unprecedented bibliometric analysis of literature reviews on SDG to assess the evolution and consolidation of the scientific research. Article reviews on SDG from 2015 to 2022 were retrieved from Web of Science core collection and a descriptive bibliometric analysis was performed by growth rate, research area, source, citation, and region. Mapping and cluster analysis using keyword co-occurrence, co-authorship, and bibliographic coupling were also applied. The result revealed that SDG is a fast-growing field, with a trend in the diversification of research areas. Most of the review documents were categorized in general aspects of sustainability. Technology (SDG 9) and economic growth (SDG 8) were spotted as hidden key research areas. This result is contrary to previous bibliometric studies on SDG, demonstrating the rapid evolution and change in the field. In addition, literature reviews on reduced inequalities (SDG 10), gender equality (SDG 5); oceans, seas, and marine environments (SDG 14); and peace, justice, and strong institutions (SDG 16) were revealed as research gaps. Thus, the results demonstrated that the research on SDG cannot yet be considered a consolidated area of research, as it leaves many SDG unexplored.

1e364e90fd03ffe58df1a34606ae2b06df54360a,"Paul Ginsborg, 1945–2022","Paul Ginsborg was the most influential British historian of Italy of his generation. Like Denis Mack Smith before him, he was well known not only to fellow historians but to general readers of history and the wider public in Italy. If he achieved this standing, it was on account of his writing, his public engagement, his political activism and his teaching. Unlike Mack Smith, who – as a Fellow of All Souls had few students despite being widely regarded as the ‘maestro’ of many (including Ginsborg), he was a passionate and brilliant teacher. Greatly admired by his many undergraduate and postgraduate students in the UK and Italy, he influenced numerous others who learned about the history of modern and contemporary Italy from his books. At the time of his death in May 2022, Paul was honorary president of the Association for the Study of Modern Italy, a society he helped found in 1982 and to whose development he was always committed. Paul was born in London in 1945 and was raised in Ealing, the son of a doctor and a pharmacist and the second of three brothers. He won scholarships to St Paul’s school and then to Queen’s College, Cambridge, where he studied History and subsequently undertook his PhD on Daniele Manin and the Venetian revolution of 1848. His supervisor was Brian Pullan. He would return to Cambridge in 1980 as a University Lecturer in Politics and Fellow of Churchill College. It might be wondered how a historian of the Risorgimento, who had been a lecturer in History at York University and who had given up that post to teach and research in Italy, came to be appointed to teach European politics. The Cambridge Social and Political Sciences committee (it did not have the status of a department or faculty) was an atypical environment. Headed by the anthropologist John Barnes, it included the sociologists Anthony Giddens and Geoffrey Hawthorn as well as the political theorist John Dunn and the Soviet historian John Barber. Regarded as off-beat by UK political scientists and far lower profile than Oxford (where the Philosophy, Politics and Economics BA had existed since the 1920s), it was a vibrant community in which radical ideas and alternative approaches enjoyed full citizenship (the core first year course in Politics was called ‘Revolutions’). Paul was no stranger to radicalism, having been engaged on the far left during his years in Italy and involved in Cambridge with protests against university complicity with the Greek military junta that culminated in the famous Garden House riot in 1970. He had also, by the time he returned to Cambridge, been commissioned by Penguin to write what would become his best-known and most successful book, A History of Contemporary Italy: Society and Politics, 1943-1992. It was the long gestation of this work that had led him to give up his lectureship at York for temporary teaching contracts in Milan and Turin so that he could research the contemporary period.

1b5662f20a9fe787cbf99f46e72d7076231a91c0,Editorial: Technological Frontiers in Dinosaur Science Mark a New Age of Opportunity for Early Career Researchers,"Implementation of innovative techniques and methodologies is currently fundamental to better understand and improve our knowledge of extinct faunas, like those of the dinosaurs. Today, dinosaur science is experiencing a revolution thanks to these innovative techniques that stem from multiple scientific disciplines (Figure 1). In fact, young researchers are taking the lead in research with new scientific approaches (e.g. Falkingham et al., 2018; Lefebvre et al., 2020; Manafzadeh and Gatesy, 2020; Bailleul et al., 2021; Nieto et al., 2021; Serrano-Martínez et al., 2021; Van Bijlert et al., 2021;Ma et al., 2022; Wiemann et al., 2022). Young scientists are the key to bringing new perspectives into science and pushing technological and methodological developments. By publishing this collection we wanted to showcase this, and present high-impact scientific projects mainly developed by worldwide young researchers in vertebrate palaeontology. The innovative approaches presented in this volume will, not only advance palaeontological knowledge but also provide new tools to all vertebrate palaeontologists, since working protocols and tasks can be easier and faster to carry on with these techniques. One impressive example is the implementation of deep learning algorithms when automating image processing, like in the labelling and segmentation of computed tomography images or when osteohistological features need to be identified. Yu et al. analyze how deep neural networks can efficiently segment protoceratopsian dinosaur fossils, which can save significant time from current manual segmentation. In the case of the implementation of deep neural network-based methods, Quin et al. have tested this technique for getting segmented maps with different osteon regions on a histological dataset from various taxa within alvarezsaurian theropods. These works set an important base for analyzing larger sets of images and samples, but also developing more complex deep learning algorithms. It is a fact that the use of 3D models in descriptive studies and for soft tissue reconstructions is growing exponentially year after year. One really nice example is the partial ankylosaur skull from the mid-Cretaceous of Queensland (Australia), which Frauenfelder et al. have digitized by synchrotron radiation X-ray tomography and then reconstructed in 3D to facilitate the virtual preparation of the separate cranial bones. Although encased in a limestone concretion, thanks to this technique the palatal anatomy of Australian ankylosaurs has been elucidated, being indeed an important element in resolving ankylosaur phylogenetic relationships. It is essential to study well-preserved fossils when assessing anatomical features for descriptions, comparisons and phylogenetic analyses.

b468b2badcf18fc5f373bea5ff8a194c54996057,Risk factors for falls among community-dwelling older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background and objective The prevalence of falls among older adults living in the community is ~30% each year. The impacts of falls are not only confined to the individual but also affect families and the community. Injury from a fall also imposes a heavy financial burden on patients and their families. Currently, there are different reports on the risk factors for falls among older adults in the community. A retrospective analysis was used in this study to identify risk factors for falls in community-dwelling older adults. This research aimed to collect published studies to find risk factors for falls in community-dwelling older adults. Methods We searched for literature from the founding of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Web of Science, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the China Science and Technology Periodicals Database (VIP), and the Wanfang database until September 2022. The studies were selected using inclusion and exclusion criteria. We collected information from relevant studies to compare the impact of potential risk factors such as age, female gender, fear of falling, history of falls, unclear vision, depression, and balance disorder on falls among community-dwelling older adults. Results A total of 31 studies were included with 70,868 community seniors. A significant risk factor for falls in the community of older adults was dementia (2.01, 95% CI: 1.41–2.86), age (1.15, 95% CI: 1.09–1.22), female gender (1.52, 95% CI: 1.27–1.81), fear of falling (2.82, 95% CI: 1.68–4.74), history of falls (3.22, 95% CI: 1.98–5.23), vision unclear (1.56, 95% CI: 1.29–1.89), depression (1.23, 95% CI: 1.10–1.37), and balance disorder (3.00, 95% CI: 2.05–4.39). Conclusion This study provides preliminary evidence that falls among community-dwelling older adults are associated with factors such as age, female gender, fear of falling, history of falls, unclear vision, depression, and balance disorders. The results of this research may help improve clinician awareness, risk stratification, and fall prevention among community-dwelling older adults.

d35b8a5c8799ed8c47ab12a924284bda086f3e36,Dealing with insecurities and geopolitics: science diplomacy at the poles,"Global environmental crises are destabilizing the cryosphere and, as a result, the capacity of the planet's glaciated regions to absorb or even persist in the face of the current velocity of physical changes (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2019, Chown et al. 2022). According to the latest data, warming in the polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic) is occurring at three to four times global average rates. These regions should not be narrated through the prism of climate change alone, as the complex regional changes engendered by the environmental and climate crises also have profound effects on the rest of the world. At both poles, climate and environmental changes provide key warnings of potential global tipping points and underpin global environmental security concerns. The polar regions are vastly different in their geographies, populations and governance structures. However, in spite of these differences and ongoing crises, scientific cooperation has – at least until now – been a major contributor to regional governance at both poles. In the south, on top of international legal norms such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), since 1961 the Antarctic continent and surrounding Southern Ocean south of 60° of latitude has been governed by a major international treaty – the Antarctic Treaty – and its component instruments and their measures, referred to as the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). Apart from year-round but transient scientific operations, the Antarctic has never had a permanent human population. Under the Antarctic Treaty, national territorial claims in the region are held in abeyance. Seven states as well as the Russian Federation (as the successor state to the USSR) and the USA have made or 'reserved their right' to make territorial claims to parts of or the entire continent. However, Article 4 of the Antarctic Treaty places these claims on hold – meaning no state can make new or expand their own sovereign claims. The ATS also prohibits military activities, the use of nuclear technologies and the disposal of radioactive waste, and it provides the frameworks for marine ecosystem and fisheries management and for environmental protection in Antarctica. Above all, the ATS provides the infrastructural mechanisms that enable state cooperation to achieve consensus governance of the Antarctic continent and surrounding Southern Ocean collectively and peacefully through science. Due to its contrasting geography, Arctic governance differs from that of its southern counterpart. As landmasses surrounding the Arctic Ocean, the eight Arctic states (the A8; Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark (Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland), Norway, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, the Russian Federation and the USA) exercise their sovereignty over the land, with five of them having Arctic coastlines and sovereign rights over parts of the Arctic Ocean. Beyond general international law, the UNCLOS provides the regulatory framework to govern those parts of the Arctic Ocean and Southern Ocean not subject to sovereign rights. Since the 1990s, the A8 have cooperated at first through the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy and later through the Arctic Council. Founded in 1996 under the Ottawa Declaration – a political declaration as opposed to an international treaty – the Arctic Council has served as a high-level intergovernmental forum for the A8 and six Indigenous political representations to flexibly work together on scientific research and policy recommendations relating to social and environmental issues. Thus far, both regions, however, have somehow been able to respond to significant geopolitical and environmental challenges. Despite their structural differences, science diplomacy and scientific research have provided two pillars for both Arctic and Antarctic cooperation. Science therefore offers an avenue to think about solutions for future geopolitical polar challenges and security issues. However, can polar governance survive both the unfolding threat of a melting Earth and the latest upsurge in global geopolitical instabilities, in particular driven by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine? This is where polar science and the science–policy nexus become matters of regional and international security. Through a critical international relations lens, security in the Arctic and the Antarctic clearly extends beyond environmental and economic security, although this should not be only understood as military security, especially since military issues are often – deliberately – off the table in both governance settings. For instance, the 1996 Ottawa Declaration explicitly expressed the wish of the A8 to keep military matters out of the Arctic Council's mandate. However, it is notable that, as a consequence of the current conflict and the massive global geopolitical ramifications that this is leading to, the Arctic Council has currently postponed all planned meetings for an undefined period, even though Russia currently holds the Council's Presidency.

The carbon dynamics in three contrasting case study regions, the Baltic Sea, the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and the South China Sea, are compared in terms of the spatio-temporal variability of surface pCO2. Ocean carbon models that range from box models to three-dimensional coupled circulation-biogeochemical models are reviewed in terms of the ability to simulate key processes and project future changes in different continental shelf regions. Common unresolved challenges remain for implementation of these models across RiOMar and OceMar systems. The long-term trends in coastal ocean carbon fluxes for different coastal systems under anthropogenic stress that are emerging in observations and numerical simulations are highlighted. Knowledge gaps in projecting future perturbations associated with before and after net-zero CO2 emissions in the context of concurrent changes in the land-ocean-atmosphere coupled system pose a key challenge. ▪ A new synthesis yields an estimate for globally integrated coastal ocean carbon sink of −0.25 Pg C year−1, with greater than 90% of atmospheric CO2 removal occurring in polar and subpolar regions. ▪ The sustained coastal and open ocean carbon sink is vital in mitigating climate change and meeting the target set by the Paris Agreement. ▪ Uncertainties in the future coastal ocean carbon cycle are associated with concurrent trends and changes in the land-ocean-atmosphere coupled system. ▪ The major gaps and challenges identified for current coastal ocean carbon research have important implications for climate and sustainability policies.

 WEAVE, the new wide-field, massively multiplexed spectroscopic survey facility for the William Herschel Telescope, will see first light in late 2022. WEAVE comprises a new 2-degree field-of-view prime-focus corrector system, a nearly 1000-multiplex fibre positioner, 20 individually deployable ‘mini’ integral field units (IFUs), and a single large IFU. These fibre systems feed a dual-beam spectrograph covering the wavelength range 366−959 nm at R ∼ 5000, or two shorter ranges at R ∼ 20 000. After summarising the design and implementation of WEAVE and its data systems, we present the organisation, science drivers and design of a five- to seven-year programme of eight individual surveys to: (i) study our Galaxy’s origins by completing Gaia’s phase-space information, providing metallicities to its limiting magnitude for ∼3 million stars and detailed abundances for ∼1.5 million brighter field and open-cluster stars; (ii) survey ∼0.4 million Galactic-plane OBA stars, young stellar objects and nearby gas to understand the evolution of young stars and their environments; (iii) perform an extensive spectral survey of white dwarfs; (iv) survey ∼400 neutral-hydrogen-selected galaxies with the IFUs; (v) study properties and kinematics of stellar populations and ionised gas in z < 0.5 cluster galaxies; (vi) survey stellar populations and kinematics in ∼25 000 field galaxies at 0.3 ≲ z ≲ 0.7; (vii) study the cosmic evolution of accretion and star formation using >1 million spectra of LOFAR-selected radio sources; (viii) trace structures using intergalactic/circumgalactic gas at z > 2. Finally, we describe the WEAVE Operational Rehearsals using the WEAVE Simulator.",Monthly notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,2022.0,35,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/mnras/stad557/49512757/stad557.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03981, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6dc07a95ea5f9f100f48f1ce86518c93d48615d7,The Future of Cybersecurity in the Age of Quantum Computers,"The first week of August 2022 saw the world’s cryptographers grapple with the second shocker of the year. Another one of the four post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms selected by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in a rigorous 5-year process was cracked by a team from Belgium. They took just 62 min and a standard laptop to break the PQC algorithm to win a USD 50,000 bounty from Microsoft. The first shocker came 6 months earlier, when another of the NIST finalists (Rainbow) was taken down. Unfortunately, both failed PQC algorithms are commercially available to consumers. With 80 of the 82 PQC candidates failing the NIST standardization process, the future of the remaining two PQC algorithms is, at best, questionable, placing the rigorous 5-year NIST exercise to build a quantum-safe encryption standard in jeopardy. Meanwhile, there is no respite from the quantum threat that looms large. It is time we take a step back and review the etiology of the problem de novo. Although state-of-the-art computer security heavily relies on cryptography, it can indeed transcend beyond encryption. This paper analyzes an encryption-agnostic approach that can potentially render computers quantum-resistant. Zero-vulnerability computing (ZVC) secures computers by banning all third-party permissions, a root cause of most vulnerabilities. ZVC eliminates the complexities of the multi-layered architecture of legacy computers and builds a minimalist, compact solid-state software on a chip (3SoC) that is robust, energy-efficient, and potentially resistant to malware as well as quantum threats.",Future Internet,2022.0,31,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/14/11/335/pdf?version=1668584391', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/fi14110335?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/fi14110335, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

32582345fac6a062134a107ea6f578a2dd2334f1,C. Thomas Caskey (1938–2022),"A pioneer of the genetic code and then genomics, Dr. C. Thomas Caskey, passed away at the age of 83 on January 13, 2022 in Houston, Texas, after a brief illness. He is survived by his wife of 62 years, Peggy Pearce Caskey, his two children, Clifton Caskey and Caroline Caskey Goodner, and three grandchildren. He will be sorely missed by them and his many trainees and colleagues around the world. The breadth of Tom’s contributions to the fields of human molecular genetics and genomics during his approximately 60year career is extraordinary. He can be credited for: contributing key work to decipher the genetic code (Caskey 1970); cloning the third human gene to be so analyzed (Brennand et al. 1982, 1983); discovering short tandem repeat expansions in human disease (Caskey et al. 1992); building a robust and ubiquitously used DNA-based human identification system (Edwards et al. 1991); founding and leading an internationally acclaimed academic department focused on molecular and human genetics; leading a division atMerck Research Laboratories in drug and vaccine development; and advancing genomic medicine in the clinic. Throughout all these endeavors, he was tremendously active in the community, both at the policy level and as an inspirational and collaborative scientist. He trained andmentored an enormous number of individuals, making an indelible impression on more than one generation of scientists. His influence was pronounced in academics, industry, and even outside the world of science. Other articles paying tribute to Tom will surely celebrate his career achievements, describe his deep passion for competitive ocean sailing, and elaborate on his multitude of trainees that now populate the research enterprise. Within the scope of Genome Research, it is particularly appropriate to note his foundational work in genomics and his impact on both genomics and genetics as the fields co-evolved. Tom trained as an M.D., then worked with Marshall Nirenberg at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) on deciphering the genetic code (Marshall et al. 1967) and, with his colleague Ed Scolnick, on the role of release factors in peptide chain termination (Scolnick and Caskey 1969). He moved to Baylor College of Medicine in 1971 to explore the molecular bases of Mendelian diseases. For much of his ensuing career, Tom studied the molecular genetics of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and the underlying gene, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT1, previously known as HPRT), co-authoring more than 60 related publications. In 1982, he undertook a sabbatical with Sydney Brenner at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK, with the specific aim of learning themolecular cloning techniques that would enable him to isolate the HPRT cDNA (Brennand et al. 1982). The momentum from this work consolidated his commitment to advancing genetics by focusing on technology development and application. In 1984, he founded the “Institute for Molecular Genetics” (later becoming the Department of Human and Molecular Genetics) at Baylor College of Medicine and soon recruited faculty, fellows, and clinicians, who together brought expertise that ranged from the basic sciences to clinical genetics. Through the work in his own laboratory, and his presence and influence in the clinic, he led the entire Institute in exploring the molecular causes of genetic diseases and building models that could be used for experimentation and therapeutic development. His leadership included the recruitment of model organism geneticists, based on his strong belief that studies in thesemodelswould provide insights that could translate to medical research and practice. Tom attended the earliest meetings on the conceptualization of the Human Genome Project, including the gathering at Alta (1984), the 1986 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium “The Molecular Biology of Homo Sapiens,” and the 1989 NIH and Department of Energy–supported Banbury Center meeting, at which plans to generate a genome-wide physical map were discussed (CookDeegan 1991). He embraced new methods to speed disease gene discovery and molecular diagnostics in his newly formed “Baylor Diagnostic Laboratories.” Meanwhile, he enabled the faculty to build programs in molecular cloning with novel vectors (e.g., cosmids and yeast artificial chromosomes), linkage mapping, and DNA sequencing. Hewas an early and passionate enthusiast for genome sequencing. In 1987, after reading about Yuji Kohara’s physical map of the E. coli genome (Kohara et al. 1987) based on bacteriophage clones, he immediately proposed the idea of pursuing a similar effort for the human X Chromosome. Shortly thereafter, following a visit to the laboratory of Craig Venter, he widely extolled the value of a full human genome sequence. He led by example and, in 1988, began a collaboration with Wilhelm Ansorge at the EMBL laboratories to sequence the entire human HPRT locus (∼44 kb) using the Pharmacia ELF Fluorescent DNA sequencing instrument. The results of this collaborationwere reported the same year as the launch of the Human Genome Project (Edwards et al. 1990) and embodied all of the methods Tom Caskey (left) and Norton Zinder (right) in November 1989 at the Banbury Meeting, “The Human Genome Project: NIH-DOE joint meeting.” (Image courtesy of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Archives.)",Genome Research,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://genome.cshlp.org/content/32/3/vii.full.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8896456, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5a024776b62f48e950f048a0269ebf425f2cc9fa,Effects of Caffeine Intake on Endurance Running Performance and Time to Exhaustion: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is one of the most widely consumed performance-enhancing substances in sport due to its well-established ergogenic effects. The use of caffeine is more common in aerobic-based sports due to the ample evidence endorsing the benefits of caffeine supplementation on endurance exercise. However, most of this evidence was established with cycling trials in the laboratory, while the effects of the acute intake of caffeine on endurance running performance have not been properly reviewed and meta-analyzed. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature on the effects of caffeine intake on endurance running performance. A systematic review of published studies was performed in four different scientific databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and SportDiscus) up until 5 October 2022 (with no year restriction applied to the search strategy). The selected studies were crossover experimental trials in which the ingestion of caffeine was compared to a placebo situation in a single- or double-blind randomized manner. The effect of caffeine on endurance running was measured by time to exhaustion or time trials. We assessed the methodological quality of each study using Cochrane’s risk-of-bias (RoB 2) tool. A subsequent meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) estimated by Hedges’ g and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: A total of 21 randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis, with caffeine doses ranging between 3 and 9 mg/kg. A total of 21 studies were included in the systematic review, with a total sample of 254 participants (220 men, 19 women and 15 participants with no information about gender; 167 were categorized as recreational and 87 were categorized as trained runners.). The overall methodological quality of studies was rated as unclear-to-low risk of bias. The meta-analysis revealed that the time to exhaustion in running tests was improved with caffeine (g = 0.392; 95% CI = 0.214 to 0.571; p < 0.001, magnitude = medium). Subgroup analysis revealed that caffeine was ergogenic for time to exhaustion trials in both recreational runners (g = 0.469; 95% CI = 0.185 to 0.754; p = 0.001, magnitude = medium) and trained runners (g = 0.344; 95% CI = 0.122 to 0.566; p = 0.002, magnitude = medium). The meta-analysis also showed that the time to complete endurance running time trials was reduced with caffeine in comparison to placebo (g = −0.101; 95% CI = −0.190 to −0.012, p = 0.026, magnitude = small). In summary, caffeine intake showed a meaningful ergogenic effect in increasing the time to exhaustion in running trials and improving performance in running time trials. Hence, caffeine may have utility as an ergogenic aid for endurance running events. More evidence is needed to establish the ergogenic effect of caffeine on endurance running in women or the best dose to maximize the ergogenic benefits of caffeine supplementation.",Nutrients,2022.0,29,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/1/148/pdf?version=1672231835', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9824573, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

On January 1, 2022, we used Web of Science to identify the 100 most frequently cited papers on clinical studies investigating anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapy, and extracted the following data: publication year, source title, country/region, institution, and the total number of citations. The research design and area were classified independently by the authors. Subsequently, we carried out a bibliometric analysis to determine the trends and identify the major journals on anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapy. The authors analyzed the current research hotspots based on papers published in major journals from 2020 to 2021. These 100 papers were cited a total of 138,840 times, and the median number of citations was 899.5 (range: 341–7,983). “Safety, activity, and immune correlates of anti-PD-1 antibody in cancer” by Topalian et al. had the highest number of citations (7,983 times). New England Journal of Medicine had the highest number of top-cited papers (40 papers), average citations per paper (1,558.3 citations), and rate of top-cited papers (65.6%). Authors from the USA contributed most of the papers (76 papers). Lung cancer (30 papers, 46,422 citations) and melanoma (20 papers, 30,881 citations) were the most cited research areas. In summary, anti-PD1/PDL1 has become standard treatment for various cancer, while adjuvant anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy is currently a research hotspot. New England Journal of Medicine was identified as the most influential journal in this area. Non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma are the most well-studied cancers, while nivolumab and pembrolizumab are the most commonly investigated anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies. Further studies are warranted to identify effective predictive biomarkers or models, clarify the molecular mechanism of combined therapy, and establish optimal therapeutic strategies.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Background Aging is a significant risk factor in chronic pain development with extensive disability and greater health care costs. Mind-body exercise (MBE) has been scientifically proven to affect the pain intensity and physical health. Objectives To assess the effects of MBE modes (Tai Chi, yoga, and qigong) for treating chronic pain among middle-aged and old people, compared with nonactive and active treatment, as well as function, quality of life, and adverse events. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and Chinese Scientific Journals Full-Text Database (VIP) till March 2022. No restrictions were chartered within the year and language of publication. We included randomized controlled trials of MBE treatment in middle-aged and elderly people with chronic pain. The overall certainty of evidence was evaluated by using the GRADE approach. Results A total of 17 studies (n = 1,332) were included in this review. There was low-certainty evidence indicating that MBE had a moderate effect on reducing pain compared with the nonactive and active control group (standard mean difference (SMD): −0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.86 to −0.42, P < 0.001). Very-low-certainty evidence showed that the pooled SMD for the functional improvement was −0.75 (95% CI: −1.13 to −0.37, P < 0.001). Low-certainty evidence presented that no influence was observed in physical component summary (SMD: 0.23, 95% CI: −0.16 to 0.62, P = 0.24) and mental component summary (SMD: −0.01, 95% CI −0.39 to 0.36, P = 0.95). Conclusion Our results indicated that MBE was an effective treatment for reducing symptoms of middle-aged and elderly people with chronic pain compared with nonactive and active control groups. TC and qigong had obvious benefits for knee osteoarthritis in self-reported function, but the efficacy of chronic low back pain was uncertain. No significant benefit of MBE on quality of life in older adults with chronic pain was found. More high-quality RCTs should be conducted to explore the efficacy and mechanism of MBE on chronic pain in middle-aged and elderly people from various dimensions, such as affective and cognitive dimensions.

Exposure to pornography may affect these experiences. Objective We aimed to synthesize evidence published in the past decade on the relationship between exposure to pornography and sexual behavior (earlier age of first sex [<16 years], condomless sex, past-year multiple partners [>1], lifetime multiple partners [>1], group sex, sexual aggression including forced sex, paid sex, teenage pregnancy, and history of sexually transmitted infection) in adolescents aged between 10 and 19 years. Methods We identified 19 eligible studies by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science databases from January 2010 to November 2022. Results Out of 8 studies that assessed earlier age of first sex, 5 studies, including 1 longitudinal study, found a statistically significant association with exposure to pornography. Given that most studies were cross-sectional or had substantial limitations, causal inference could not be made. Also, exposure to pornography was not measured consistently. The evidence was conflicting or insufficient to draw any conclusions regarding other outcomes. Conclusions More quantitative research is needed to elucidate the association between pornography exposure and sexual behavior, and sex education should adopt evidence-based approaches to minimize the potential harms from pornography.

Heritage building information modeling (HBIM), which is a digital method of conserving architectural heritage, has recently received a great deal of attention from researchers, planners, and policy-makers in related fields around the world. However, there is not yet a complete analysis of the hot spots and trends in this area of research, nor has a complete workflow based on the practical application of HBIM been developed. In this article, we analyzed the research progress, hot spots, and trends in HBIM since 2010. We used the CiteSpace scientometric analysis tool to analyze 372 documents with high relevance to HBIM from the Web of Science core database using literature co-citation analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis, cluster analysis, and keyword emergence detection. The findings show that research in the field of HBIM was still in the conceptualization stage during 2010–2017, and with the continuous development of various technologies, attention to HBIM has gradually accelerated since 2017 by expanding its uses to multidisciplinary fields such as artificial intelligence. In the cluster analysis of literature co-citations, 14 clusters were generated, and four clusters, semiautomatic 3D modeling, heritage information system, pilot study, and virtual reality, which have high rates of citation, are discussed in this paper. These clusters reflect the hot spots and frontiers of research in HBIM to a certain extent. In the “Discussion” section, a systematic and complete workflow of HBIM application to heritage architecture is proposed for three levels: modeling, data exchange, and auxiliary management. On this basis, the development of the field of heritage building conservation and sustainable development is analyzed to provide valuable theoretical and practical references to propose future research directions.",Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,2022.0,17,"{'url': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01414-y.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1057/s41599-022-01414-y?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01414-y, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6d20e101bc837af0fd1e54eb38c81314292b6c7f,Campaigning for a Global Collections Network: Improving the digital representation and visibility of natural science collections from Latin America and the Caribbean,"Global conservation of biodiversity is more important than ever before. The success of the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and monitoring strategy will depend on the availability of reliable, information-rich biodiversity data. Natural science collections throughout the world are repositories for and stewards of primary biodiversity records, which they maintain and preserve in the long-term, and can contribute to biodiversity monitoring specifically at the species and genetic diversity levels.
 Accurate and up-to-date information about scientific collections as data providers and mediators lie at the core of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data (Wilkinson 2016). The visibility and discoverability provided by collections’ digital representations promote an institution’s, a country’s and a region’s wealth in biodiversity records and data; highlight human efforts and social networks for maintaining and providing access to high-quality physical and digital records; and form the basis for attribution and effective transaction managment implementing the CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics; Carroll 2021). Providing powerful functionality, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl) is evolving into the global catalog for information on collections.
 The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region is among the most biodiverse regions of the planet. Throughout the LAC region, a wealth of initiatives exists for describing, recording, protecting and managing biodiversity and biodiversity data. The region’s many collections, their scientists, staff and volunteers are crucial partners in these endeavors. A diversity of local to national and regional networks are active, fostering communication, support and capacity building.
 Last year, the Biodiversity Crisis Response Committee (BCRC) of the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC) in cooperation with the GRSciColl team at GBIF, developed the concept and first materials for a Global Collections Network Campaign. In cooperation with the national GBIF Node, a pilot campaign was conducted in Ecuador. In addition, close connections were formed to the task group developing Latimer Core, TDWG’s upcoming collection description standard, the MaterialSample task group of Darwin Core, as well as the community developing the next-generation data infrastructure based on the Digital Extended Specimen concept (Hardisty et al. 2022) and open FAIR digital objects (Schultes and Wittenburg 2019), e.g. defined by the openDS standard.
 Building on the pilot campaign and continuing the collaboration with the GRSciColl team, a partnership endorsed by GBIF’s SPNHC node and led by two members of SPNHC’s BCRC was formed that includes biodiversity scientists, collections staff and GBIF national node managers from Argentina, Ecuador and Guatemala. Supported by the GBIF Capacity Enhancement Support Programme and starting in August 2022, the partnership has the goal to increase the number, coverage and density of high quality records available through GRSciColl, thereby providing visibility and improving the recognition of natural science collections existing within the three countries and the LAC region. The CESP project contributes towards the aim of the campaign to build step by step an equitable, inclusive and engaged Global Collections Network.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://biss.pensoft.net/article/91356/download/pdf/', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.6.91356?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.6.91356, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It resulted in a series of unique cyber-crime-related conditions that impacted society and business. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) has dramatically increased in recent year. Automated detection of this type of attack is essential to protect business assets. In this research, we demonstrate the use of different deep learning algorithms to accurately detect DDoS attacks. We show the effectiveness of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms to detect DDoS attacks in computer networks with high accuracy. The LSTM algorithms have been trained and tested on the widely used NSL-KDD dataset. We empirically demonstrate our proposed model achieving high accuracy (~97.37%). We also show the effectiveness of our model in detecting 22 different types of attacks. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

652caf01e5f3a29fe5076f5b486c03ddcdd30c37,Reducing Cyber Crime in Africa through Education,"Technology needs and uses are expanding in Africa. Cybersecurity challenges faced daily are: child pornography, stolen money, data breaches, denial of service, online extortion, cred-it-card fraud, identify theft, network takeovers via botnets, fake news and emails, ransomware, and more. Since the Internet is ubiquitous, any security improvement in one location benefits all. This paper postulates that such security achievements can be attained through high-quality engineering education in cybersecurity. ABET is the recognized world leader in accrediting programmes in engineering and computing. In their 2022–23 Criteria for Accrediting Computing Programs, ABET published criteria for accrediting two-year programmes in cybersecurity. The novel research question we examine is what it would take to spawn an ABET-accreditable, two-year degree in cybersecurity from a typical African Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. As experts with a combined $\mathbf{35+}$ years' experience with ABET accreditation, we use a systematic methodology to evaluate and analyse a programme in a de-tailed, step-by-step, easy-to-understand manner and show exactly what needs to be done to build a two-year cybersecurity programme. Our approach is straightforward, comprehensive, and replicable. Two-year programmes are a step toward developing a cybersecurity workforce in Africa, where there are few programmes dedicated to cybersecurity. It is our hope that this work inspires and shows educational institutions a way to spawn two-year programmes in cybersecurity from their existing programmes. The rationale and significance of this work is that it leads the way to develop educational pro-grammes in cybersecurity in Africa. The cadre of workers that could be added to Africa's workforce from this research is relevant and critical to Africa's development and online security. Without having the personnel and tools to fight cyber-crime properly, the continent falls behind on the international stage and is unable to compete successfully for international businesses. News reports of increasing incidents of cyber-crimes originating from particular regions and countries, badly damage their reputations as locations for healthy places to conduct business.

The performance of this stroke at an elite level is influenced by a number of biomechanical, physiological and psychological factors. The present systematic review aimed to synthesise the biomechanical factors influencing elite breaststroke swimming performance. This review aims to provide elite coaches and performance scientists with a breadth of knowledge from which training and racing interventions can be developed. Methods Electronic searches of Medline, Scopus and SPORTDiscus databases were conducted in May 2020 and March 2022. Search results that were peer-reviewed, published in English and published during or after the year 2000 were considered for review. The methodological rigour of studies was assessed using a risk of bias scale previously used for the evaluation of sports science research. Results Thirty-eight articles were included in the present review. Articles investigated elite breaststroke performance in relation to one of the following areas: stroke kinematics, temporal patterns, neuromuscular activity, pacing and kinetics. Discussion Kinematic, temporal and neuromuscular activity comparisons between groups of various race distance, performance or experience level, and athlete sex were common in the literature. These analyses demonstrated differences in stroke rate, stroke length, propulsive time, recovery time, glide time, sum of total integrated EMG and triceps brachii activation patterns between groups. The evaluation of various pacing strategies, and the relationship between kinetics and breaststroke performance was comparatively rare within the literature.

a2af643637938bff57290861b7ec85b192ceb3ac,The Construction of Probabilistic Wildfire Risk Estimates for Individual Real Estate Parcels for the Contiguous United States,"The methodology used by the First Street Foundation Wildfire Model (FSF-WFM) to compute estimates of the 30-year, climate-adjusted aggregate wildfire hazard for the contiguous United States at 30 m horizontal resolution is presented. The FSF-WFM integrates several existing methods from the wildfire science community and implements computationally efficient and scalable modeling techniques to allow for new high-resolution, CONUS-wide hazard generation. Burn probability, flame length, and ember spread for the years 2022 and 2052 are computed from two ten-year representative Monte Carlo simulations of wildfire behavior, utilizing augmented LANDFIRE fuel estimates updated with all the available disturbance information. FSF-WFM utilizes ELMFIRE, an open-source, Rothermel-based wildfire behavior model, and multiple US Federal Government open data sources to drive the simulations. LANDFIRE non-burnable fuel classes within the wildland–urban interface (WUI) are replaced with fuel estimates from machine-learning models, trained on data from historical fires, to allow the propagation of wildfire through the WUI in the model. Historical wildfire ignition locations and NOAA’s hourly time series of surface weather at 2.5 km resolution are used to drive ELMFIRE to produce wildfire hazards representative of the 2022 and 2052 conditions at 30 m resolution, with the future weather conditions scaled to the IPCC CMIP5 RCP4.5 model ensemble predictions. Winds and vegetation were held constant between the 2022 and 2052 simulations, and climate change’s impacts on the future fuel conditions are the main contributors to the changes observed in the 2052 results. Non-zero wildfire exposure is estimated for 71.8 million out of 140 million properties across CONUS. Climate change impacts add another 11% properties to this non-zero exposure class over the next 30 years, with much of this change observed in the forested areas east of the Mississippi River. “Major” aggregate wildfire exposure of greater than 6% over the 30-year analysis period from 2022 to 2052 is estimated for 10.2 million properties. The FSF-WFM represents a notable contribution to the ability to produce property-specific, climate-adjusted wildfire risk assessments in the US.",Fire,2022.0,12,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6255/5/4/117/pdf?version=1660728498', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/fire5040117?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/fire5040117, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The first objective was to quantify how frequently artificial intelligence (AI) was utilized in dental literature from 2011 until 2021. The second objective was to distinguish the focus of such publications; in particular, dental field and topic. The main inclusion criterium was an original article or review in English focused on dental utilization of AI. All other types of publications or non-dental or non-AI-focused were excluded. The information sources were Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, queried on 19 April 2022. The search string was “artificial intelligence” AND (dental OR dentistry OR tooth OR teeth OR dentofacial OR maxillofacial OR orofacial OR orthodontics OR endodontics OR periodontics OR prosthodontics). Following the removal of duplicates, all remaining publications were returned by searches and were screened by three independent operators to minimize the risk of bias. The analysis of 2011–2021 publications identified 4413 records, from which 1497 were finally selected and calculated according to the year of publication. The results confirmed a historically unprecedented boom in AI dental publications, with an average increase of 21.6% per year over the last decade and a 34.9% increase per year over the last 5 years. In the achievement of the second objective, qualitative assessment of dental AI publications since 2021 identified 1717 records, with 497 papers finally selected. The results of this assessment indicated the relative proportions of focal topics, as follows: radiology 26.36%, orthodontics 18.31%, general scope 17.10%, restorative 12.09%, surgery 11.87% and education 5.63%.

This systematic review provides insight into the costs of multimorbidity through addressing the following primary and secondary research questions: What evidence exists on the costs of multimorbidity? How do costs of specific disease combinations vary across countries? How do multimorbidity costs vary across disease combinations? What “cost ingredients” are most commonly included in these multimorbidity studies? We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42020204871) of studies published from January 2010 to January 2022, which reported on costs associated with combinations of at least two specified conditions. Systematic string-based searches were conducted in MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Global Health, Web of Science, and Business Source Complete. We explored the association between costs of multimorbidity and country Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita using a linear mixed model with random intercept. Annual mean direct medical costs per capita were pooled in fixed-effects meta-analyses for each of the frequently reported dyads. Costs are reported in 2021 International Dollars (I$). Fifty-nine studies were included in the review, the majority of which were from high-income countries, particularly the United States. (1) Reported annual costs of multimorbidity per person ranged from I$800 to I$150,000, depending on disease combination, country, cost ingredients, and other study characteristics. (2) Our results further demonstrated that increased country GDP per capita was associated with higher costs of multimorbidity. (3) Meta-analyses of 15 studies showed that on average, dyads which featured Hypertension were among the least expensive to manage, with the most expensive dyads being Respiratory and Mental Health condition (I$36,840), Diabetes and Heart/vascular condition (I$37,090), and Cancer and Mental Health condition in the first year after cancer diagnosis (I$85,820). (4) Most studies reported only direct medical costs, such as costs of hospitalization, outpatient care, emergency care, and drugs. Multimorbidity imposes a large economic burden on both the health system and society, most notably for patients with cancer and mental health condition in the first year after cancer diagnosis. Whether the cost of a disease combination is more or less than the additive costs of the component diseases needs to be further explored. Multimorbidity costing studies typically consider only a limited number of disease combinations, and few have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries and Europe. Rigorous and standardized methods of data collection and costing for multimorbidity should be developed to provide more comprehensive and comparable evidence for the costs of multimorbidity.",BMC Medicine,2022.0,73,"{'url': 'https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12916-022-02427-9', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9295506, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

534bb5720452195efdce041f4bb44682c09dac46,The experiences of spousal and adult child caregivers of stroke survivors in transitional care: A qualitative systematic review.,"AIM
To synthesize and present the currently available literature on the experiences of spousal and adult child caregivers of stroke patients in transitional care.


DESIGN
This is a qualitative systematic review.


DATA SOURCES
Eight electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, PsychINFO, ProQuest and Scopus) were searched from September 2020 to April 2022 for relevant literature and grey literature. Qualitative studies exploring the experiences of sspousal or adult child caregivers of stroke survivors up till 1 year after discharge were included.


REVIEW METHODS
The selection of articles was done by two independent reviewers who screened the titles and the abstracts of studies, and the full texts of selected articles. Quality appraisal and data extraction of selected articles were undertaken by two independent reviewers using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. Data synthesis was conducted using a meta-aggregative approach recommended by JBI.


RESULTS
A total of 19 papers were included in this review. A total of three synthesized findings centred around caregivers' experience with healthcare professionals, changes in their life roles and needs, effects of caregiving and how they adapted to their changes were aggregated.


CONCLUSION
Spousal and adult child caregivers faced multiple barriers during transitional care, such as the lack of resources and an inability to cope with changes in their lives. Support and adequate preparation were key facilitators in easing stroke caregivers into their role.


IMPACT
The findings from this review can be used to guide future implementations of caregiver education programmes and comprehensive discharge planning for stroke survivors.",Journal of Advanced Nursing,2022.0,11,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/jan.15420?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15420, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Due to the minimal contact between lecturers and students in online learning, particularly in science, students must study independently. The significance of individual learning during the CoVD-09 epidemic provides the context for this study. This research intends to identify the profile of junior high school students' independence in scientific learning throughout the academic year 2021-2022. This research is descriptive. This study's population consisted of 116 pupils enrolled in the eighth grade of junior high school. The sample for this research consisted of 37 eighth-grade SMP students selected using a simple random selection procedure. Furthermore, the data gathering approach employed a non-test technique, namely a questionnaire. The analysis of data was conducted using descriptive statistics. The findings indicated that the general average of pupils' freedom in learning was classified as very independent (81%). In addition, 14 students are in the very independent category, which is equal to (40%), 12 students are in the independent category, which is equal to (34%), and seven students are in the fairly independent category, which is equal to (20%), four students are in the less independent category that is equal to (12.9%), and no one is categorized as very less independent than 37 students.

7f84edf0ac43aec2d943f3c7d6bb1c0e3811174d,Global and regional prevalence and incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus in low-and-middle income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be more prevalent among most ethnic groups in the low-and-middle income countries (LMICs), still these countries are under-represented in epidemiological data on SLE. The aim of this study was to review the prevalence and incidence of SLE in LMICs and use meta-analytic techniques. The MEDLINE, CINHAL, Web of Science, Scopus and Global Index Medicus databases were searched for relevant studies published up to July of 2022. Papers selected for full-text review were included in the systematic review if they provided the prevalence or incidence of SLE in LMICs and published in English language. The reference lists of included articles were also searched for additional studies. Two individuals independently performed abstract and full-text review, data extraction, and quality assessment of the papers. The prevalence and incidence of SLE were pooled through random effects model. Pooled estimates were expressed with 95% confidence. Out of 2340 papers, 23 studies were included in the review. The mean age at diagnosis ranged from 25.5 to 45.8 years. Three studies were conducted in Argentina and Brazil, two studies in China and one study in Cuba, Colombia, Democratic Republic Congo, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkey, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. The SLE prevalence and incidence varied from 3.2 to 159 per 100,000 and 0.3–8.7 per 100,000 persons, respectively. In a random effects meta-analysis (n = 10), the pooled prevalence of SLE was 103 (95% confidence interval [CI] – 17 to 224) per 100,000. Meta‐analysis of data from 6 incidence studies revealed an incidence of 5 cases per year (95% CI 2–8) per 100,000. According to WHO regions, the pooled prevalence of American and Western Pacific regions was 300 (95% CI – 200 to 900) and 36 (95% CI 35–37) per 100,000, respectively. The pooled incidence of the American region was 10 (95%, 0–14) per 100,000 inhabitants. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a common disease with considerable variation in prevalence and incidence among the general population in LMICs. Accurate estimates of prevalence and incidence of SLE are required to put in place appropriate programmes to reduce its burden in LMICs.

8843648fc53fc6c7b2efbda3c53265071d5fe6f8,Enhancing the quality of cognitive behavioral therapy in community mental health through artificial intelligence generated fidelity feedback (Project AFFECT): a study protocol,"Background Each year, millions of Americans receive evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of mental and behavioral health problems. Yet, at present, there is no scalable method for evaluating the quality of psychotherapy services, leaving EBP quality and effectiveness largely unmeasured and unknown. Project AFFECT will develop and evaluate an AI-based software system to automatically estimate CBT fidelity from a recording of a CBT session. Project AFFECT is an NIMH-funded research partnership between the Penn Collaborative for CBT and Implementation Science and Lyssn.io, Inc. (“Lyssn”) a start-up developing AI-based technologies that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient, to support training, supervision, and quality assurance of EBPs. Lyssn provides HIPAA-compliant, cloud-based software for secure recording, sharing, and reviewing of therapy sessions, which includes AI-generated metrics for CBT. The proposed tool will build from and be integrated into this core platform. Methods Phase I will work from an existing software prototype to develop a LyssnCBT user interface geared to the needs of community mental health (CMH) agencies. Core activities include a user-centered design focus group and interviews with community mental health therapists, supervisors, and administrators to inform the design and development of LyssnCBT. LyssnCBT will be evaluated for usability and implementation readiness in a final stage of Phase I. Phase II will conduct a stepped-wedge, hybrid implementation-effectiveness randomized trial ( N  = 1,875 clients) to evaluate the effectiveness of LyssnCBT to improve therapist CBT skills and client outcomes and reduce client drop-out. Analyses will also examine the hypothesized mechanism of action underlying LyssnCBT. Discussion Successful execution will provide automated, scalable CBT fidelity feedback for the first time ever, supporting high-quality training, supervision, and quality assurance, and providing a core technology foundation that could support the quality delivery of a range of EBPs in the future.

4c0f5aad2597d975eadfd436366b39a451d92dc5,U.S.-China trade relations in an era of great power competition,"Abstract The tech war is having an effect on U.S.-China trade. For high-tech products like telecommunications equipment, semiconductors, and computer accessories, there has been a sharp drop in trade in both directions. This is not simply a drop in demand in the U.S. for these items because imports of them from other partners has soared. Vietnam’s exports to the U.S. jumped in the sensitive categories, and overall Vietnamese exports to the U.S. more than doubled between 2018 and 2021. Despite these effects from the tech war, however, overall U.S.-China trade has held up surprisingly well. The year 2022 will almost certainly see a new historical high for trade in both directions. This resilience of trade, in the face of tariffs and tech sanctions, indicates that there is a strong economic foundation for the two-way relationship. For both China and the U.S., it is hard to replace the other one as a trade partner. It is possible for production of a few specific items to shift from China to Vietnam, but there is no way to replace China’s huge manufacturing output. From China’s point of view, the technologically advanced countries are all allies of the U.S., and it is not easy for China to turn to Europe for the technology it cannot get from America. Because U.S.-China trade is based on strong fundamentals, it will probably continue at a high level, in an uneasy equilibrium in which certain trade and investment is off-limits, while other business goes on.",China Economic Journal,2022.0,7,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/17538963.2022.2117185?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/17538963.2022.2117185, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

301a55d4dc9919653587d2ab47dd25be67a92747,Trends in Artificial Intelligence in Nursing: Impacts on Nursing Management.,"OBJECTIVE
Investigate the academic use of artificial intelligence in nursing.


BACKGROUND
Bibliometric analysis combined with the VOSviewer software quantification method has been utilized for literature analysis. In recent years, this approach has attracted the interest of scholars in various research fields. Thus far, there is no publication using bibliometric analysis combined with the VOSviewer software to analyze the applications of artificial intelligence in nursing.


METHOD
A bibliometric analysis methodology was used to search for relevant articles published between 1984 and March 2022. Six databases, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, WoS, and MEDLINE, were included to identify relevant studies, and data such as the year of publication, journals, country, institutional source, field, and keywords were analyzed.


RESULTS
Most relevant articles were published from institutions in the United States of America. The League of European Research Universities has published most research studies that use artificial intelligence and nursing. Scholars have mainly focused on nursing, medical informatics, computer science AI, health care sciences services, and physics particles fields. Commonly used keywords were machine learning, care, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, prediction, and nurse.


CONCLUSION
Research articles were mainly published in Nurse Education Today. Research topics such as artificial intelligence-assisted medical recording and medical decision-making were also identified. According to this study, artificial intelligence in nursing has the potential to attract more attention from researchers and nursing managers. Additional high-quality research beyond the scope of medical education, as well as on cross-domain collaboration, is warranted to explore the acceptability and effective implementation of artificial intelligence technologies.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT

Good quality will give good results as well, to improve the quality of each lecturer, it is necessary to have an award given to lecturers from the campus so that it becomes a motivation for lecturers to improve the quality given to students and the community. Amik Mitra Gama is a private campus located in the Duri Riau area, in this case to improve the quality of education one of the steps taken is to give awards and appreciation to the best lecturers who will be selected every year. To realize this, we need an easy calculation system that is carried out in the form of ranking according to the final value, therefore a decision support system using the ARAS method is chosen because it is very appropriate for the selection process and provides convenience in the calculations which are determined based on ranking. The decision support system using the ARAS method uses 8 criteria that are set as a reference in determining the best lecturers, namely Recent Education, Lecturer Functional Position, Lecturer Certification, Number of Journal Publications, Roles in Research, Journal Publication History, Research Grants, and Community Service.

Methods On the 1st of March 2022, the top 100 most cited papers regarding endometrial carcinoma published from 1971 to 2021 were identified through searching Web of Science Core Collection database and the following data: title, author, journal, publication year, country and institution were extracted. Microsoft Office Excel (2019) was used for descriptive statistical analysis. VOSviewer (1.6.18) was used to perform and visualize co-authorship analysis and co-occurrence analysis. Results These 100 papers were cited a total of 45, 685 times, and the mean number of citations was 456.85 (range, 228 to 2487). Most papers were published between 1996 and 2000, and between 2006 and 2010. The Lancet published the largest number of papers (n=12), followed by Gynecologic Oncology (n=11). Most of the papers were from the United States (n=58), followed by Italy (n=8) and Netherlands (n=7). Duke University, Johns Hopkins University, University of California San Francisco and University of Southern California (all in United States) contributed the most papers (n=4, respectively). Nicoletta Colombo contributed the most papers (n=3) as the corresponding author. The co-occurrence keywords were classified into three clusters: cluster 1 (epidemiology study), cluster 2 (molecular biology study) and cluster 3 (clinical treatment study). Early research that was published prior to 2005 in this field was mainly focused on epidemiology and molecular biology; the mean publication year for keywords in cluster 3 was later than other clusters. The keywords “external-beam radiotherapy,” “uterine serous carcinoma,” and “intermediate-risk” showed relatively later mean publication year and lower mean frequency of occurrence. Conclusions This study provides medical researchers with bibliometric information relating to endometrial carcinoma. Our results show that the United States is a clear leader in this field. The clinical treatment of endometrial carcinoma has received increasing levels of attention over recent years and is likely to remain a major area of research in the future.

The review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) statement. A literature search was carried out in April 2020 (updated in January 2022) using seven electronic databases, including ERIC, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed with Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool. Cohen’s d effect sizes and post-hoc power analyses were conducted for the included studies. Altogether 22 studies (1883 children) met the inclusion criteria, representing children at-risk for learning difficulties, due to family background (nstudies = 8), children with learning difficulties (nstudies = 7), learning disabilities (nstudies = 5), and physical disabilities (nstudies = 2). Two of the included 22 studies displayed strong, one moderate, and 19 studies weak methodological quality. The intervention effects appeared to be somewhat dependent on the severity of the learning difficulty; in cognitive and language skills, the effects were largest in children at-risk due to family background, whereas in executive functions the effects were largest in children with learning disabilities. However, due to the vast heterogeneity of the included studies, and a rather low methodological quality, it is challenging to summarize the findings in a generalizable manner.

The aim of the present study was to identify and record the proportion of Scoping Reviews in orthodontics that have been clearly and adequately justified, based on the methodological framework of such types of reviews. Associations with a number of publication characteristics were also sought. Three major databases, namely PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection, as well as 11 specialty orthodontic journals were electronically sought from inception until August 1, 2022, for ScRs. The primary outcome pertained to whether the published reports of the ScRs included an appropriate justification and explanation for the selection of this kind of knowledge synthesis methodology. Potential association with year, journal, continent of authorship, number of authors, methodologist involvement, appropriate reporting guidelines and registration practices followed were explored. Results A total of 40 ScRs were eligible for inclusion, with the majority not being adequately justified (22/40; 55.0%). The majority of studies were published from 2020 onward (32/40; 80.0%). The regression model did not reveal any significant association between justification of ScRs and a number of publication characteristics ( p  > 0.05 at all levels).

Kenya has a high rate of HAP, mainly caused by solid fuels. This review assesses its effect and identifies factors that could improve policy in Kenya. A systematic review approach is used, mainly considering 88 research articles on the Web of Science, published from 1951 to 2022. We excluded studies on HAP caused by other forms of fuel, subjective study types, and studies focusing on animals. The results show that rural settings and urban slums have more HAP, ventilation is an important factor, HAP is high in the evening, and children and women health is significantly affected. There is a need for interventions to reduce the use of biomass fuels in Kenya. The interventions include improved access to efficient cookstoves with ventilation, community health awareness about ventilation, housing rules for better ventilation in rural and urban areas, and NGO partnership for improving access to improved cookstoves in rural areas. The government’s role includes subsidizing the supply and cost of renewable energy and adopting energy policies that encourage populations to switch to more efficient cookstoves, cleaner energy, and modern biofuels.",Frontiers in Environmental Science,2022.0,6,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.996038/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/fenvs.2022.996038?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.996038, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8f35bbf036df1ef894d8c8a79f16b7a2521e4f23,A Review of Automatic Question Generation in Teaching Programming,"Computer programming is a complex field that requires rigorous practice in programming code writing and learning skills, which can be one of the critical challenges in learning and teaching programming. The complicated nature of computer programming requires an instructor to manage its learning resources and diligently generate programming-related questions for students that need conceptual programming and procedural programming rules. In this regard, automatic question generation techniques help teachers carefully align their learning objectives with the question designs in terms of relevancy and complexity. This also helps in reducing the costs linked with the manual generation of questions and fulfills the need of supplying new questions through automatic question techniques. This paper presents a theoretical review of automatic question generation (AQG) techniques, particularly related to computer programming languages from the year 2017 till 2022. A total of 18 papers are included in this study. one of the goals is to analyze and compare the state of the field in question generation before COVID-19 and after the COVID-19 period, and to summarize the challenges and future directions in the field. In congruence to previous studies, there is little focus given in the existing literature on generating questions related to learning programming languages through different techniques. Our findings show that there is a need to further enhance experimental studies in implementing automatic question generation especially in the field of programming. Also, there is a need to implement an authoring tool that can demonstrate designing more practical evaluation metrics for students. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

c04ff2919173adcf7aae346a6bd70652a68ad4f9,Development of A Bootcamp for Freshman Student Success During COVID-19 Transition,"Results from internal assessments show that passing rates in introductory courses as well as retention rates of first-year students in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, a predominantly Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), significantly dropped with the advent of COVID-19. Such results and trends provide an overall perspective on the academic preparation of incoming students. There is a high concern that the necessary skill set (e.g., adaptability, persistence, and performance) of the new cohort, who are primarily underrepresented Hispanics from underserved and challenged communities from the Rio Grande Valley, is not optimal for the rigor of engineering education. To this end, an onboarding bootcamp for incoming and transfer students was created to bridge the transition from secondary education to higher education by priming students to overcome academic deficiencies, develop a critical skills portfolio, learn problem-solving techniques, build a sustainable community of mentoring support with faculty and students, and provide a template to sustain academic and professional success during their undergraduate education. This research-to-practice paper presents the bootcamps' design process steps: curricular analysis, identification of areas of opportunities, skills inventory, and blueprinting process, as well as its initial implementation in the mechanical engineering program. In this regard, the bootcamp was organized over a week span with hands-on engineering activities, faculty and student talks, and engineering lab tours;and was based on a design thinking approach. Daily activities were structured based on challenge-based instruction, innovation, design, and mentoring, and focused primarily on promoting critical thinking, being assertive in the face of adversity, making informed decisions, and prioritizing tasks. Results indicate that the bootcamp increased student confidence and established a valuable network system amongst other findings. Future work will focus on expanding the bootcamp to include students from other engineering and computer science departments and to offer the template to institutions with similar academic challenges. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/41401.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41401?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41401, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The present study assessed the prevalence, sociodemographic characteristics, risky behaviors, mental health conditions, and type of drug use associated with suicidal behaviors among IVDUs. Methods Studies in English published from January 1, 1995 to February 1, 2022 were searched on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science to identify papers on variables associated with suicidal behaviors (ideation and attempts) among IVDUs. Results Out of 10,795 papers, 21 studies met the eligibility criteria. Among IVDUs, the findings indicated a past-year pooled prevalence rate of 35% for suicide ideations (95% CI, 22%–48%) and 25% for suicide attempts (95% CI, 13%–36%). Generally, suicide ideations were associated with being homeless, having a previous history of physical and sexual abuse, and depression. Suicide attempts were associated with being female, having a previous history of physical and sexual abuse, having depression or other mental health disorders (e.g., anxiety, stress, and serious mental health disorders), and having cocaine, methamphetamine, sedative-hypnotic, and polysubstance use disorders. Conclusions Integrated treatment and assertive community treatment approaches may be promoted to prevent suicidal behaviors. Such programs can be implemented for referring individuals to receive suicide attempt-concerned interventions and motivational therapy.",Journal of Substance Use,2022.0,4,"{'url': 'https://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/47009/1/1596244_Griffiths.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/14659891.2022.2120435?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/14659891.2022.2120435, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Material/Methods A literature search was performed using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley Library, and Web of Science database keywords and medical, applied medical science, dental colleges headings, followed by a summary and analysis of results. We included all related studies that used DREEM as a tool and were published up to 2022. The following information was extracted from the included studies: researcher’s name(s), publication year, overall DREEM, domain, gender, and educational levels. Results Among the 40 studies included in this review, 25 papers were conducted in medical colleges, 5 in applied medical science, and 10 in dental colleges. Overall, DREEM scores among all involved colleges were “more positive than negative,” with scores between 101 and 150. In relation to the 5 domains of DREEM, the percentages of medical colleges ranged from 75% to 88% for all domains, whereas it was higher in dental (80% to 90%) in most domains, but considerably lower for applied medical science (50% to 75%). Females had higher DREEM values in dental than medical and applied medical science colleges, whereas educational levels were higher in applied medical science colleges.

99acc0adc7623e2cd62da8bd45db4519154fad32,498 Investing in Translational Science: Forging Critical Connections with Investment Professionals,"OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The Virtual CTSA Visiting Scholars Program allows KL2 scholars to serve as visiting professors at host CTSA consortium institutions. This program facilitates connections with faculty outside scholars home institutions, as well as fostering collaboration among different CTSA hubs. Stanford aimed to incorporate participants into its KL2 program. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Stanford is one of 57 host institutions for the Virtual CTSA Visiting Scholars Program. The program includes a virtual meeting between each participant and a chosen faculty at the host institution. Program participants also give a virtual Grand Rounds lecture, open to the entire CTSA consortium. As well as encouraging Spectrum KL2 Scholars to participate in the virtual exchange, the Spectrum KL2 program incorporated the visiting scholars into weekly activities over the course of 3 months. Visiting scholars were invited to participate virtually in KL2 educational sessions, which provide career development training and mentoring. As meetings transitioned to in-person, KL2 scholars were allowed to attend virtually when needed. Hybrid in-person sessions were also conducive to participation by visiting scholars. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Stanfords Spectrum KL2 program was virtual (Zoom) for academic year 2020-2021 and included 1:1 mentoring sessions, weekly career development seminars, and 1:1 peer virtual lunches to integrate the 9 junior faculty scholars. Visiting scholars joined the weekly Zoom meetings when their schedules allowed. KL2 faculty mentored visiting scholars for 3 months, exchanging ideas and forming collaborations. Each visiting participant was paired with a KL2 Scholar, who provided 1:1 peer mentorship. In addition, visiting scholars presented a work-in-progress seminar, to obtain feedback before the more formal Grand Rounds lecture. For academic year 2021-2022, Spectrum KL2 meetings include virtual and hybrid in-person sessions, allowing visiting scholars to join by Zoom during the 3-month virtual exchange program. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: What set Stanfords Virtual CTSA Visiting Scholars Program apart was faculty engagement and mentorship provided to visiting participants. By incorporating visiting scholars virtually into the ongoing KL2 education program, participants could engage fully with mentors and scholars, even surpassing opportunities of pre-pandemic on-site visits.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/092C9E81174BC0F02DAF11CF1E3AE207/S205986612200293Xa.pdf/div-class-title-498-investing-in-translational-science-forging-critical-connections-with-investment-professionals-div.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9209304, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

64fc3d3f52a71cf80642db675513088f990f2060,Proximity and Political Science: How Distance was Overcome (Partially) by COVID-19,"DOI:10.1017/S1049096522000312 Akey enemy of understanding is isolation. Distancemakes itmore difficult to craft scholarly insights, to obtain feedback, and to share ideas with other scholars. Because of this, tight-knit communities have long demonstrated advantages in research and learning. In the current globalized world, distance remains a problem for scholars of the Asia–Pacific region. In contrast to Europe and the Americas—regions characterized by continents—the Pacific is an ocean with a diverse set of nations, most of which exist separated from one another, on the rim. This physical geography complicates attempts to study and to communicate insights about regional affairs. Arguably, our understanding of the region is hampered by one of its most important attributes: the physical separation of its component nations. Cyberspace overcomes distance. Its most useful attribute is the ability to transmit ideas and images across space, linking individuals and groups—especially in situations in which geographic separation is a significant impediment. Although they are a distant second-best to actually being in person, virtual meetings through cyberspace for some time have been an alternative or complement to conferences and talks at remote locations. They are most attractive where the physical movement of people is most difficult, such as in the Asia–Pacific region. The Pacific International Politics Conference Online Seminar Series (PIPCOSS) is an online workshop designed to encompass the intellectual interests of international relations (IR) scholars based in or engaging with the Asia–Pacific region. The series emerged in part from the annual meetings of the Pacific International Politics Conference (PIPC), which were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. PIPCOSS’s audience consists mainly of PhD-holding academics, researchers, and political science students, including not only previous PIPC participants but also newcomers. Seminars last about an hour, with a short presentation from the author and formal comments from two discussants, followed by a general Q&A session. Authors are expected to circulate a draft paper to the discussants one week before the presentation. Since June 2020, we have held 38 meetings (as of the end of March 2022). The affiliated institutions of the presenters are located in Australia (four), Canada (one), China (two), Germany (one), Hong Kong (seven), India (one), Japan (four), Singapore (one), South Korea (one), Switzerland (one), Taiwan (one), the United Kingdom (one), and the United States (13). The size of the audience varies between 10 and 35 people, depending on the date and time of the sessions. Thursday and Friday sessions tend to draw a larger audience. Community building is one of the critical tasks for online workshops. We circulate information on upcoming talks, which includes the title of the presentation and author information, to the PIPC listserv and other country-based and IR listservs, about a week before and on the day of the presentation.We also encourage past participants to introduce PIPCOSS to colleagues and serve as discussants to stay connected and build a community. Ironically, the average number of participants was higher during the peak of the pandemic. As vaccinations mitigated the pandemic, institutions have begun in-person teaching, which imposes more time constraints on potential participants and discussants. Once inperson teaching is restored everywhere, wewill increase our efforts to expand the community by reaching out to scholars in countries that have not been included yet (e.g., Southeast Asian countries). If there is a greater demand to set a regular meeting day and time, we will consider doing so as well. In addition, we want to hold an online mixer to receive feedback from previous and potential participants about community building. The PIPCOSS steering committee, which is composed of six members diverse in terms of age, gender, and location, diligently addresses issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The committee works to create an environment in which people from different backgrounds feel comfortable participating. PIPCOSS reduces the barriers for participants from underrepresented groups in that workshop organizers are doing the legwork of networking for the presenter, who may not have the resources to reach out to higherprofile scholars or scholars in another country. PIPCOSS also gives priority to graduate students, who have had fewer opportunities to present their research due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, PIPCOSS sessions usually are held during Asian working hours while also being accessible for those joining from Europe and North America. This addresses issues of equity and inclusion for scholars who otherwise would find it difficult to participate due to their geographic location. Cross-border travel within the Asia–Pacific region is costly because it usually is by air. Therefore, PIPCOSS enables intraregional inclusion by providing an easily accessible and friendly platform to exchange ideas for scholars in distant locations across the region. As vaccination rates increase and the pandemic gradually comes under control, it is important to consider how the community of Asia–Pacific IR scholars can continue to benefit from our online presence and the creative adaptations it has made to date. Although there can be no replacement for in-person meetings, PIPCOSS and similar online seminar series have distinct advantages, three of which are cost, convenience, and reduced carbon footprint. Whereas many universities faced serious financial difficulties— or at least cost constraints—during the pandemic, web-based meetings provided a lowor no-cost alternative to international travel. Even as our institutions recover financially in the coming years, the perennial challenge of managing what for many is the scarcest resource (i.e., time) will remain. Web-based research meetings are highly efficient in terms of time. We do not need to leave our desks to attend, different time zones usually can be accommodated, chat functions allow a parallel Q&A session that can be downloaded and saved after the meeting, and sessions can be recorded easily for viewing by those who cannot attend in real time. Many political scientists also are greatly concerned about climate change. Online meetings have proven to be a viable tool that has the potential to significantly reduce our collective carbon footprint. Those of us who travel frequently in the Asia–Pacific region typically cover vast distances by air each year. For instance, a roundtrip Los Angeles to Seoul flight produces about 885 kg of carbon, according to the United Nation’s International Civil Aviation Organization web calculator.1 Given the vastness of the",PS: Political Science & Politics,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/S1049096522000312?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096522000312, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Study participants were all medical students at King Saud University of Medical Sciences in the first and second years (648 students), and the study was conducted from December 2021 to January 2022. We administered the survey on paper as well as online. We used three types of questionnaires in this study. The first was a self-administered questionnaire, the second was a validated Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for finding sleeping problems, and the third was a validated DASS 10 for determining Depression, Anxiety, and Stress. A total of 361 pre-clinical medical students consisted of 146 (40.4%) males and 215 (59.5%) females. The majority of the students, 246 (68.1%), were in their second year. Furthermore, in the current study, students who had poor academic performance (15.8%), satisfactory academic performance (21.3%), or good academic performance (30.7%) had significant sleeping problems found (χ2 = 19.4; p = 0.001), among them poor academic performance students 21.6%, satisfactory academic performance students (29.3%), and good academic performance students (29.3%) had moderate to severe levelled sleeping problems.

aa04833539dd41a55b7ed9dafc0c3445725a3814,A Deep-Learning Method for the Prediction of Socio-Economic Indicators from Street-View Imagery Using a Case Study from Brazil,"Socioeconomic indicators are essential to help design and monitor the impact of public policies on society. Such indicators are usually obtained through census data collected at 10-year intervals, which are not only temporally coarse but expensive. Over recent years other ways of collecting data and producing these indicators have been explored, in particular using the new surveillance capabilities that remote observations can provide. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the assessment of socioeconomic indicators using street-view imagery, through a case study conducted in a region of Brazil, the Vale do Ribeira, one of the poorest semi-rural regions in Brazil. In this study we used socioeconomic indicators collected by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and used Google Street View (GSV) images as our source of remote observations. A pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to predict socio-economic indicators from GSV. To evaluate the performance of the classifier, we performed five-fold cross-validation between the predicted indicator and its true value. The best performance was obtained for the highest income class, with 80% of correct prediction. We conclude that the method has the potential to predict socioeconomic indicators across a large area with social challenges such as Vale do Ribeira, and that the network model is general enough to be used even when the imagery dataset is from semi-rural areas. This demonstrates the applicability of GSV datasets for similar settings and perhaps ensuring their replicability, which is a scientific requirement that requires further experimentation/evaluation. *Author affiliations can be found in the back matter of this article 2 Machicao et al.

The module is a fundamental compulsory module with an intake of 100+ students in the part-time class studying the conversional MSc course in Software Development.This paper focuses on the challenges and opportunities faced by large class students during this unprecedented move online, and changes made to the curriculum to facilitate the move to online teaching and learning using the conceptual framework for effective online courses. The paper reflects on student feedback to online educational activities including synchronous and asynchronous content delivery, discussion forums, ungraded formative quizzes, formative and summative assessments delivered online for a postgraduate cohort studying part-time. Sustained level of student engagement was evidenced through statistics collected from the virtual learning environment.This paper further discusses how the above has transformed teaching of the Computing Foundations module for the large cohort, focusing on the student experience only, and reflecting on how these online teaching practices contribute to provision of education with a view what developments became a success and could be turn to advantage and what was not effective and should be eliminated post-pandemic. Adaptation of the Computing Foundation module to the new model of online delivery has been successful in the 2020-2021 academic year, and the module has become a distance module delivered fully online in the 2021-2022 academic year.

Adding to the challenge, and because the science requires a cloud-free measurement, significant effort has been expended in both attempting to predict the impact of clouds on the coverage as well as removing cloudy acquisitions on-board to reduce the pressure on the shared ISS downlink pipeline. In this paper we will explore the ways in which the EMIT mission design has been shaped by the performance requirements imposed by the science on data sufficiency and quality along with the constraints imposed by ISS operations and hardware limitations. Various sensitivity analyses are presented investigating the impact of ISS orbit altitude and seasonality on the coverage of the science target mask, along with data compression and throughput, cloudiness assumptions, and downlink data rate effects on on-board storage sizing and margins.",IEEE Aerospace Conference,2022.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843581?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843581, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Thus, technological innovations are used in the adaptation of online learning to educate students, as well as to enhance the teaching and learning process in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions. There is a need to expose students to the online learning revolution, which conceptualises using computerised systems to facilitate the learning process. However, the COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted the academic year across the country. Due to the unusual circumstances related to the pandemic, the Malaysian government has urged all academic institutions to conduct online teaching and learning. Thus, an e-Learning system, known as SpmiILP, has been designed and developed accordingly for an interactive multimedia course to encourage online interaction among students and lecturers, as well as to enhance human learning and cognitive development. In fact, these essential elements such as learning style of the students and user experience are focused on to engage them in learning effectively as well. An e-Learning System for Interactive Multimedia Course was used to develop the e-Learning system (SpmiILP). The usability test showed that the developed e-Learning system has a positive influence that provided potential contributions to (TVET) students in their learning processes. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

1b9844d2271eba8c087301b223c522ec5a927371,BERT-Based Hybrid RNN Model for Multi-class Text Classification to Study the Effect of Pre-trained Word Embeddings,"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic which started in the year 2020, many nations had imposed lockdown to curb the spread of this virus. People have been sharing their experiences and perspectives on social media on the lockdown situation. This has given rise to increased number of tweets or posts on social media. Multi-class text classification, a method of classifying a text into one of the pre-defined categories, is one of the effective ways to analyze such data that is implemented in this paper. A Covid-19 dataset is used in this work consisting of fifteen pre-defined categories. This paper presents a multi-layered hybrid model, LSTM followed by GRU, to integrate the benefits of both the techniques. The advantages of word embeddings techniques like GloVe and BERT have been implemented and found that, for three epochs, the transfer learning based pre-trained BERT-hybrid model performs one percent better than GloVe-hybrid model but the state-of-the-art, fine-tuned BERT-base model outperforms the BERT-hybrid model by three percent, in terms of validation loss. It is expected that, over a larger number of epochs, the hybrid model might outperform the fine-tuned model. © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

d2c9f54a7905dcedd09be8c6202fba6ce92e8cea,Comparing Access and Participation Outcomes of Schools Engaged in a Multi-school CS and Cybersecurity Intervention (Evaluation),"In early 2020, a cohort of 30 high schools engaged in a year-long intervention designed to increase their ability to offer Computer Science (CS) and Cybersecurity education to their students. After we performed an evaluation on the intervention's impacts, we turned our attention to whether or not the outcomes were influenced by engagement of the schools in the cohort. In this research paper, we focus on the guiding research question: How do schools' engagement in an intervention designed to build equitable CS and Cybersecurity education capacity impact schools' course offerings and students' participation in these courses? To measure equitable impact, we evaluated changes to actual CS and Cybersecurity course offerings and enrollment at the schools. We focused on the differences in participation across student gender and race/ethnicity as well as participation levels at the different schools across three years prior to the intervention and one year after the intervention. Findings indicate that, despite the disruption to schools from the COVID-19 pandemic, schools engaged in the program had very significant increases in AP CSP, AP CS A, and Cybersecurity course offerings and enrollment, particularly at schools that serve students from low-income families. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/41065.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41065?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41065, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

253057afd15350064ca5c80521b363041aadf628,Increasing Global Competencies through International Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Research on Big Data in Energy and Related Infrastructure,"This paper describes the first year of the implementation of a three-year long NSF-funded International Experience for Students (IRES) Site Track-1 project. As a part of the IRES Site Track-1 project, three engineering programs at three U.S. universities have collaborated on a project to increase the global competencies of undergraduate engineering/computer science students through a summer international research training program in big data in energy and related infrastructure in partnership with the Universiti Teknologi Petronas in Perak, Malaysia. The U.S. Universities included Texas A&M University, North Dakota State University, and University of Nevada at Las Vegas. The IRES program includes two-week pre-visit trainings on cultural and global aspects and six-week team-based research experience at the partner Malaysian university. However, due to COVID-19 restriction, all activities in the first year was conducted virtually in Summer 2021. A total of 9 participants were selected, three each from the three US Universities. The IRES participants were divided into three teams. Each project team consisted of one member from four participating institutions (3 U.S. and one Malaysian) thus providing students with a global team environment. Furthermore, of those 4 student members in a team, they represented multiple engineering disciplines. A survey conducted before and after the program showed net overall improvement in the research aptitude of the participants and their understanding on research methods, professional presentation skills, and global teamwork. Furthermore, the IRES students also attended a month-long training on global culture and received a certificate on global competency issues by the Halliburton Global Engineering Program at Texas A&M University. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://strategy.asee.org/41995.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41995?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41995, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f988d48d3039df9b138533f59ab15c00db0f7603,Insights Provided by Student Feedback on Integrated E-Learning Modules Covering Entrepreneurial Topics,"As a best practice, it is customary to ask students for their feedback on curricular interventions. The feedback is typically used to justify further changes and ascertain how well they may accept the intervention for broader implementation. At the University of New Haven, 18 e-learning modules were developed and integrated into courses spanning the 4-year engineering and computer science majors' curricula. The modules centered on topics seen to contribute to the development of students' entrepreneurial mindset. We saw this as a way to assist faculty in leveraging entrepreneurial minded learning (EML) in their courses when the topics are likely outside their area of expertise. The development, integration, and students' learning assessment efforts of the e-learning modules have been the topics of many of our previous papers and presentations. This paper focuses on an analysis of the feedback collected from students regarding the modules and their integration. Our faculty have been using the modules for over five years. In that span, we have collected over 1000 student responses to an end-of-term survey administered in every course in which a module was integrated. The survey includes questions pertaining to time spent on the module and the associated course assignment, their level of agreement related to statements about their perceived effectiveness of the curricular intervention, and open-ended response questions focused on what they liked/did not like about the modules and their integration. Our findings thus far reveal a positive trend in the students' perception of the e-learning modules and their integration over the span of the deployment. Correlation analysis of several indicators provide further insights about students' attitudes towards the modules. For example, students place more value on the module if they see a connection between the module content and the content of the course, as well as if the instructor reinforces what they learned in the module through a contextual activity. However, despite students seeing value in the module or stating that the assignment supported the concepts taught in the module, we do not find a strong correlation to students expressing interest in additional modules of this type integrated into their courses. These findings are insightful and timely given the increased use of hybrid learning in a COVID and post-COVID academic environment. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/41353.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41353?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41353, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In addition, fracture classification is important for determining the surgical method and restoring the patient's mobility. Recently, with the help of computers using artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML), diagnosis and classification of hip fractures can be performed easily and quickly. The purpose of this systematic review is to search for studies that diagnose and classify for hip fracture using AI or ML, organize the results of each study, analyze the usefulness of this technology and its future use value. Methods PubMed Central, OVID Medline, Cochrane Collaboration Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, and AHRQ databases were searched to identify relevant studies published up to June 2022 with English language restriction. The following search terms were used [All Fields] AND ("", ""[MeSH Terms] OR (""""[All Fields] AND ""bone""[All Fields]) OR ""bone fractures""[All Fields] OR ""fracture""[All Fields]). The following information was extracted from the included articles: authors, publication year, study period, type of image, type of fracture, number of patient or used images, fracture classification, reference diagnosis of fracture diagnosis and classification, and augments of each studies. In addition, AI name, CNN architecture type, ROI or important region labeling, data input proportion in training/validation/test, and diagnosis accuracy/AUC, classification accuracy/AUC of each studies were also extracted. Results In 14 finally included studies, the accuracy of diagnosis for hip fracture by AI was 79.3–98%, and the accuracy of fracture diagnosis in AI aided humans was 90.5–97.1. The accuracy of human fracture diagnosis was 77.5–93.5. AUC of fracture diagnosis by AI was 0.905–0.99. The accuracy of fracture classification by AI was 86–98.5 and AUC was 0.873–1.0. The forest plot represented that the mean AI diagnosis accuracy was 0.92, the mean AI diagnosis AUC was 0.969, the mean AI classification accuracy was 0.914, and the mean AI classification AUC was 0.933. Among the included studies, the architecture based on the GoogLeNet architectural model or the DenseNet architectural model was the most common with three each. Among the data input proportions, the study with the lowest training rate was 57%, and the study with the highest training rate was 95%. In 14 studies, 5 studies used Grad-CAM for highlight important regions. Conclusion We expected that our study may be helpful in making judgments about the use of AI in the diagnosis and classification of hip fractures. It is clear that AI is a tool that can help medical staff reduce the time and effort required for hip fracture diagnosis with high accuracy. Further studies are needed to determine what effect this causes in actual clinical situations.",Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research,2022.0,21,"{'url': 'https://josr-online.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13018-022-03408-7', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714164, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These makerspaces offer exposure to a wide range of tools and activities guided by equitable approaches to help break down barriers of entry to computer science fields. To build upon this work, Georgia Institute of Technology has recently started a dedicated K-12 makerspace on its campus and is piloting a two-year program with the National Center for Women & Information Technology to expose women and gender non-conforming high-school students of all backgrounds to programming and collegiate-level research in STEM areas. Using Project GUTS as a base curriculum, we focus on physical and on-screen activities that explore the concept of complex adaptive systems as physical representations within the real-world. Two research directions for the project are, first, studying how learning gains are impacted when incorporating physical representations of complex systems to the curriculum as opposed to relying purely on online simulations, and second, studying how a makerspace supports learning about complex systems in general. We are currently in the first stage of the program, working with a group of high-school students in the 2021/2022 school year. We are excited to share our ongoing process with other researchers and educators to discuss how we may improve this program for future iterations.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3478432.3499243?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3478432.3499243, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The study aimed to examine if fertigation with nitrogen applied at a standard rate results in the best cucumber yield in two greenhouses with different soil nutrient levels, i.e. optimal and high. We investigated the nitrogen (N) uptake pattern of cucumbers with the different nitrogen supply levels which included half the standard rate (N0.5), the standard rate (N1) and double the standard rate (N2). In year 2020, the N1 amendment resulted in highest yield in the soil with optimal nutrient level, however, lower N0.5 resulted in higher yield in the high-nutrient soil. In year 2021, there was no statistical difference in the yield by different nitrogen supply levels in both soils with optimal and high nutrient level. Soil NO3-N remained low in the low nutrient soil regardless of the amount of N supplied, but soil NO3-N was high in the high nutrient soil supplied with N2. The Partial Factor Productivity of Nitrogen (PFPN) was highest in the N0.5 and it decreased as N supply increased in the optimal and high nutrient soil. In conclusion, a precise fertigation schedule is needed to be set with the consideration of the soil nutrient status.",Korean Journal of Soil Science and Fertilizer,2022.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.kjssf.org/articles/pdf/d2zA/ksssf-2022-055-01-4.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.7745/kjssf.2022.55.1.027?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.7745/kjssf.2022.55.1.027, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

He was initially diagnosed to have nodular vasculitis based on early repeated biopsies. Despite the patient’s good compliance with his prednisolone medication, no significant clinical improvement was observed. Another biopsy, which was arranged after two years of treatment for nodular vasculitis, supported the diagnosis of sporotrichosis. Itraconazole was initiated, and all the lesions showed a remarkable response toward the treatment. The delay in finding the correct diagnosis unnecessarily exposed the patient to the side effects of steroid and caused the disease to worsen.

a000b392ff1e8fb0bd910503e081297aacd4bd03,Workshops Without Borders: Building an Online Community of Japan Scholars,"DOI:10.1017/S1049096522000270 In June 2020, the Project on Middle East Political Science (POMEPS) launched a virtual research workshop for junior scholars to fill the void left by the cancelation of so many conferences and workshops due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 2021–2022 academic year, we expanded the virtual workshop dramatically to include 18 workshops dedicated to book manuscripts or journal-article manuscripts. Because of the format’s flexibility, efficiency, and advantages for diversity and inclusion, we plan to continue it even when travel becomes possible again. There are costs and risks, however, that require attention. Overall, the move to virtual research workshops has been a resounding success. Since its launch, POMEPS has conducted 24 workshops, including 82 junior-scholar authors and 58 seniorscholar discussants. Each two-hour article workshop typically features three papers, each with one assigned discussant. The authors are asked to read the other two papers, whereas discussants may but are not required to do so. As the convener and moderator, I read all of the papers and provide a second set of comments to supplement the assigned discussant. Book workshops, which are more intense, typically last 90 minutes for one paper or three hours for two papers on related themes. Each book manuscript has two dedicated readers, in addition to myself and typically one other member of the selection committee. We conducted 11 virtual bookworkshops for the 2021–2022 academic year. The buy-in from theMiddle East political science (and broader Middle East studies) community has been phenomenal. Although we cannot offer honoraria, almost all invited discussants usually agree to participate. If they are unavailable, they often offer suggestions for alternatives—which is useful when the topics of the papers or books are outside of the organizers’ areas of expertise. A Zoom meeting will never be as much fun as an in-person seminar, but the relatively small size of the group keeps everyone engaged and allows for personal interactions. Authors do not present their manuscript, assuming that it has been read in advance, which maintains a high level of engagement because there are few long spans of only listening. The virtual format allows us to more fully include scholars based in theMiddle East and Europe, for whom it otherwisemight be prohibitively expensive and pose complicated visa issues. We can offer invitations without regard to physical distance or national location. As a result, scholars from the Middle East and Europe who otherwise might have been excluded for logistical or cost reasons can participate at a high level: 40 of the 82 article authors and eight of the 11 book authors participated from outside of the United States. This also allows us to forego extensive advance planning, travel arrangements and logistics, andmultiday disruptions. The selection process actively seeks applicants from outside of the usual elite institutional networks, on the assumption that junior scholars from top schools already have support from their institution and are networked into the scholarly community. POMEPS has definite plans to continue these workshops even after the world heals; however, there are disadvantages to the format. In general, we have not heard the common complaint that online sessions are alienating, non-interactive, or unproductive. The small size and engagement-oriented organization has resulted in dynamic and productive sessions. Zoom burnout is real, however. We have found that a session lasting more than a few hours is difficult to sustain, even for the most dedicated of us. Time zones also have been an issue—we sometimes struggle to find workable times for participants who might be calling in from the West Coast of the United States and from Doha, Qatar. Moreover, there is no substitute for the informal time after inperson workshops sharing cocktails or dinner or an evening walk through a new city. We are concerned that the ease of virtual workshops will lead to a two-tier system in which non-U.S. based scholars benefit from feedback and professional development but remain excluded from the more informal social benefits of inperson events. A more significant concern about the potential for a selfdestructive dynamic is the tendency to overschedule because it is so easy and inexpensive to do so. The sheer volume of workshops enabled by the virtual format can be overwhelming, not only for the organizer who reads and comments on all of the papers almost weekly but also for the larger community. If we exhaust the pool of plausible readers and return multiple times to the same senior scholars, at some point, their enthusiasm for being a discussant inevitably will wane. Furthermore, it is possible that funders will observe the success of online models and become unwilling to fund the more expensive and unwieldy in-person events. That would be very disappointing because many new ideas and enduring partnerships are developed in those informal spaces of inperson conferences and workshops.▪",PS: Political Science & Politics,2022.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/S1049096522000282?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096522000282, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

df348ad59ae67591590adbca86fd74f941f7c2b2,Methods of Reimbursement for Telemedicine Services: A Scoping Review,"Background: With the advent of coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19), telemedicine services have played an essential role in reducing the transmission of this virus between patients and health care providers. Nevertheless, financial and reimbursement barriers are the biggest challenge in adopting these technologies. It seems necessary to determine the successful reimbursement methods in different countries. The purpose of this study was to identify methods of reimbursing telemedicine services. Methods: A search without time limitation was conducted on the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases in December 2020 and updated in January 2022. Articles were identified using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two researchers independently evaluated the titles, abstracts, and full text of the articles. Results: Out of 4946 identified articles, 28 articles were included. In these studies, the most used insurances were Medicare (n = 17), and Medicaid (n = 15). The majority of services included telepsychiatry (n = 7), telehealth (n = 7), and telemedicine (n = 7). There was no difference between the reimbursements in telemedicine services and face-to-face visits in 18 studies. Conclusion: Various government, state, and private insurance reimbursed telemedicine services. In most studies, there was no difference between reimbursing telemedicine services and in-person visits. Differences in the type and number of reimbursements may be due to the year of publication of the articles, changes in covered service policies, and state laws. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to develop and update the guidelines and regulations for telemedicine reimbursement.

Platelets and high-altitude exposure: a meta-analysis. High Alt Med Biol 00:000-000, 2022. Background: How high-altitude hypoxia influences platelets is controversial. We attempted to quantify the impact of high-altitude exposure on platelets through meta-analysis. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, VIP, Wanfang, and CNKI) and identified articles reporting an association between platelet count (PC) or platelet indices (platelet distribution width, mean platelet volume [MPV], and plateletcrit) and high-altitude exposure. The mean and standard deviation were extracted, and the standard mean difference (SMD) was estimated using random-effects models. Stata 15.3 was used to analyze statistical data. Results: Thirty-two studies were ultimately included. For acute high-altitude hypoxia (1-14 days), no significant difference was detected, even in patients with acute mountain disease. For the chronic high-altitude hypoxia (≥1 month) group, a significant decrease in PC (SMD [95% confidence interval, CI] = -0.34 [-0.63 to -0.04]) and increase in MPV (SMD [95% CI] = 1.55 [0.60 to 2.49]) were detected compared with those in the control group. Subgroup analysis showed that the tendency was more obvious in the group with longer exposure (≥1 year). Moreover, the PC of the chronic mountain sickness group was less compared with the healthy altitude control group (SMD [95% CI] = -1.82 [-2.74 to -0.91]). Conclusion: A reduced PC and an increased MPV are associated with chronic exposure to high-altitude hypoxia. Moreover, acute high-altitude exposure has no significant influence on platelets.",High Altitude Medicine & Biology,2022.0,15,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1089/ham.2021.0075?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1089/ham.2021.0075, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

29bc922a0c58ec8eb3ade17ba4eaf397ec19526e,Techno‐economic evaluation of regional CCUS implementation: The STRATEGY CCUS project in the Ebro Basin (Spain),": STRATEGY CCUS (Strategic Planning of Regions and Territories in Europe for Low-Carbon Energy and Industry through CCUS) is a 3-year project (2019-2022) funded by the European Commission to support the development of low-carbon energy and industry in eight regions of Southern and Eastern Europe by 2050. Among the three most promising regions selected was Ebro Basin (Spain) where local development plans (or scenarios) were defined for CO 2 capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies implementation based on an industrial cluster approach. Potential regional impact analysis of these CCUS implementation plans was carried out based on the environmental impact assessment, social-economics factors, social acceptance and in-depth techno-economic analysis. The Ebro Basin region is located at the north-east (NE) of Spain and was selected based on its level of CO 2 industrial emissions, estimated geological storage capacity and well-defined transport network (pipelines, roads, rail and ports). The base scenario presented was built with the aim of covering the most extensive CO 2 network but limited by the storage possibilities in the area. It covers the 15 largest emitters in the region, 3 storage sites and a complete transportation network including trucks, pipelines and ships. An alternative scenario was also proposed considering only those industries where CCUS technologies are already included in their decarbonisation strategy. The economic analysis of proposed scenarios is presented as an in-depth set of key performance indicators (KPIs), as cost per tonne of CO 2 avoided, allowing an effective comparison of the scenarios, understanding the real potential for CCUS implementation in the area and pointing out key needs for making it possible. © 2022 The Authors.

ee690e221e5023efb428d70c781da18eec61f0a5,On the formulation of disulfide herbicides based on aminophenoxazinones: polymeric nanoparticle formulation and cyclodextrin complexation to combat crop yield losses.,"BACKGROUND
The resistance of weeds to herbicides is a significant issue in ensuring future food supply. Specific examples are Plantago lanceolata, Portulaca oleracea and Lolium rigidum, which mainly infect rice, wheat, barley and pastures, and cause high yield losses every year. In this regard, natural products and their mimics have provided new hope as a result of their different modes-of-action, activity at low concentrations and reduced pollution effects relative to conventional herbicides. However, the poor water solubility and physicochemical properties of these compounds limit their broad application. These problems can be addressed by formulation techniques, and encapsulation appears to be of great interest.


RESULTS
Disulfide herbicides inspired by aminophenoxazinones have been formulated with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD), γ-CD and polymeric nanoparticles (NPs). In silico studies were employed to identify which complexes would be generated and complex formation was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Solubility diagrams were generated to assess any improvement in water solubility, which was enhanced 2-13-fold. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectra confirmed the success of the formulation process for the nanoparticles. Formulated compounds were evaluated in an in vitro wheat coleoptile bioassay, with almost 100% elongation inhibition achieved using only water for the bioassay. Specific in vitro testing on weed phytotoxicity showed that the application of core/shell NPs is highly effective in the fight against P. lanceolata seed germination.


CONCLUSIONS
The formulation of disulfide herbicides with CD complexes and NPs led to an enhancement in water solubility and bioactivity. These systems can be applied in pre-emergent mode against P. lanceolata, using only water to prepare the sample, and they showed better activity than the positive controls. © 2022 The Authors.

e6f0243d2b35f18413a75de567bea1fa7f5b4fbe,Enhanced and sustained pesticidal activity of a graphene‐based pesticide delivery system against the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella,"Abstract Background Traditional abamectin (Abm) formulations have several shortcomings, such as low water solubility, burst release behavior, poor photostability, and short persistence periods, which decrease their pesticidal activity and the risks they pose to the environment. Nanomaterial‐based pesticide delivery systems (PDSs) provide new strategies for the efficient and safe application of pesticides. Here, we developed Abm‐loaded graphene oxide (Abm/GO) as a PDS for the sustained release of Abm, which shows enhanced control efficacy against Plutella xylostella. Results The hydrophobic Abm molecule was effectively loaded on GO nanocarrier by a physisorption method, which formed a uniform and stable Abm/GO nanoformulation. GO possesses high adsorption capacity and can effectively load Abm. The Abm/GO nanoformulation shows enhanced water dispersion stability and can remain stable during a 2‐year storage period in contrast to the water‐insoluble Abm. In addition, the Abm/GO nanoformulation exhibits sustained pesticide release behavior and possesses significantly improved anti‐ultraviolet properties. Thus, the Abm/GO nanoformulation shows superior pesticidal activity compared with Abm. Abm/GO showed negligible toxicity to maize seedlings, and its GO nanocarrier can reduce the cytotoxicity of Abm to A549 cells. Conclusion GO‐based PDSs can effectively overcome the disadvantages of traditional pesticides, such as their insolubility, burst release behavior, instability, and short persistence period. GO shows much future promise in agriculture in light of its industrialization potential. © 2022 The Authors.

The emerging mobile learning trends in the current 21st century education is useful in teaching and learning spelling. However, there were limited reviews about them. As such, a systematic review was conducted to provide an up-to-date synthesis on the mobile learning trends in supporting the mastery of spelling from year 2012 to year 2022. This review adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses which is also known as the PRISMA guideline. Three databases were involved: Web of Science, Scopus and Educational Resources Information Centre. After a rigorous screening process, a total of 19 articles fitted its objectives. Firstly, significant findings from the studies portrayed the use of four platforms in mobile learning trends in supporting the mastery of spelling namely mobile apps, spell-checker apps, word prediction apps and text messaging apps. Secondly, the primary level of education was more dominant in the related studies than the secondary and tertiary levels. Thirdly, it emphasised more on the students with a lower prevalence on teachers and both teachers and students as the respondents in the associated studies. This paper contributes to systematically reviewing 19 eligible related studies through a step-by-step protocol of identification, screening, eligibility and included as in the PRISMA guideline to establish quality review. It benefits both the English Language teachers and students in utilising various mobile learning platforms to support the mastery of spelling at all levels of education. It aspires to foreground the paucity in this topic in which more substantial studies are required to address the research gaps. The ultimate goal is to impose effective and practical strategies to advance mobile learning trends in supporting the mastery of spelling.",International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://online-journals.org/index.php/i-jim/article/download/33633/12455', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3991/ijim.v16i24.33633?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3991/ijim.v16i24.33633, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

24a250f2055a4fcaaac2402574c317be27c5f523,Ecology for Sustainable Development in the Anthropocene,"The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) call for celebrating the year 2022 as the 'International Year of Basic Sciences for Sustainable Development’ (IYBSSD) is an ambitious move and a golden year in the history of science itself, as IYBSSD is aimed at putting a spotlight on the interdependencies and intricacies between basic sciences and the Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) so that political leaders, policymakers, and even the general public at large will realize the prime significance of basic sciences for global sustainability (Triendl 2000; Griggs et al. 2013; Editorial 2021). While this momentum for global awakening and solidarity brings reason to rejoice, it also warrants retrospection. Exploring the unseen potentialities of basic sciences for furthering the transition towards a healthy planet is indeed a welcome move so that humanity can live in harmony with nature while averting the negative impacts of anthropogenic activities (Dalton 2002) and maximizing the socioeconomic and biocultural benefits for a good quality of life and human wellbeing. It will also help us to learn new norms in the wake of pandemics like COVID-19 (Lin et al. 2021). However, it is also a matter of retrospection that even with the exponential advancement in science and technology (thanks to modern technology, we are now venturing into outer space and planets), human curiosity and ingenuity failed to understand the resilience and carrying capacity of our own planet and how the ongoing alterations in nature and natural processes are going to affect our own survival. As echoed by scientists across the globe (Seitzinger 2010; Griggs et al. 2013; Foley 2017), planet Earth is at a crossroads and our actions during this decade will determine the future of the rest of the species. Hence, it is the prime time to harness the immense potential of basic sciences like ecology for sustainable development. While technology can offer solutions to most of the challenges (Triendl 2000; Dalton 2002; Editorial 2021), technological advancements alone are not enough to solve all of the ecological and environmental crises we are facing today. Positive attitudes and behavioural changes are more important than ever in order to effectively use the power of sustainable technologies to address ongoing planetary crises (Priyadarshini et al. 2022). Hence, repositioning the basic sciences as a better and more effective means of advancing sustainable development is critical for reducing our carbon footprint while resetting a more respectful and sensitive relationship with nature (Seitzinger 2010; Editorial 2021).The present editorial briefly outlines the significance of ecology for facilitating the transitions towards a greener, cleaner, and more resilient planet and its unexplored potential for reconnecting and reinforcing humans' relationship with nature in the Anthropocene. Ecology, the ""study of the relationships between living organisms, including humans, and their physical environment"" (http:// www. esa. org), wrought by the legacies of the pioneer ecologists during the last few centuries, is believed to be a comparatively new discipline (http:// www. oxfor dbibl iogra phies. com). For a modern biology student, the origin of ‘Ecology’ as a systematic and scientific discipline can be traced back to the monumental works of Carl Linnaeus, Alexander von Humboldt, and many others, whereas for a science historian, the origin can even be linked to the classical botanical works of Theophrastus in 348 BC (http:// www. brita nnica. com). However, Ecology is one of the oldest scientific disciplines, as old as humanity and gradually evolving with human civilization. Humanity thrived on this planet primarily because of their ecological knowledge (Odum 1977; Kormondy 2012) and their intricate associations with nature, which started during the cave-dwelling period onwards. Even before the origin of Homo sapiens, early hominids might have had thorough ecological knowledge regarding their surrounding environment: knowledge about the best time to hunt, to distinguish edible and nonedible commodities, to recognize the medicinal and curative properties of plants, the seasonal responses of plants and * Purushothaman Chirakkuzhyil Abhilash pca.iesd@bhu.ac.in",Anthropocene Science,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s44177-022-00035-z.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9396579, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6380abfa87a32a02c61171b6bec9bdb653b28ec8,MCDM APPROACHES FOR EVALUATING URBAN AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS: A SHORT REVIEW OF RECENT STUDIES,"Studies related to transportation planning and development have been in the center of activities of many researchers in the past decades. Road congestions issues, economic problems, health problems and environmental problems are some examples of complex problems that can be caused by urban and public transportation in big cities. Evaluating urban and public transportation systems could help to reach effective solutions to overcome these issues. This article presents a short bibliographic review of some recent studies on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approaches for evaluating urban and public transportation systems. To this aim, Scopus was chosen as the database for making a search on journal articles. Scopus is trusted by major institutions in the world, and all journals covered in this database are inspected for sufficiently high quality each year. The search was made on the journal articles from 2017 to 2022 (July). The analyses presented in this study show that the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is the most used method, which has been applied to different studies in the field of urban and public transportation systems based on MCDM approaches. According to the analysis of the number of articles, Turkey is ranked 1st among different countries, and “Budapest University of Technology and Economics” (Hungary) is 1st in the ranking of institutions. Moreover, most of the articles have been published within the “social sciences” subject area. The recent trend in different studies on urban and public transportation systems shows the importance of using MCDM approaches in this field. Moreover, noticeable employment of fuzzy sets in several studies is a point that can shows the significant role of uncertainty in dealing with this type of problems.",Transport,2022.0,13,"{'url': 'https://journals.vilniustech.lt/index.php/Transport/article/download/18376/11530', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3846/transport.2022.18376?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3846/transport.2022.18376, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Physical activity has significantly declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. Declines in physical activity have correlated with increased levels of perceived stress, though studies examining physical activity and stress have failed to account for critical confounds. The present study aims to determine whether physical activity independently predicts perceived stress in students attending private four-year universities. Physical activity, socioeconomic status, resilience, gender, and perceived stress data were collected from 85 students and used in a multiple linear regression analysis. The regression model accounted for 43.5% of the variance in perceived stress (R2 =.462, p <.001). Total physical activity significantly and inversely predicted perceived stress (β = –.229, p =.007) in students irrespective of other covariates. Socioeconomic status, resilience, and gender also independently and significantly predicted perceived stress. Findings should be leveraged by university staff to promote psychological well-being and wholistic health initiatives incorporating physical activity as a primary and modifiable component. © 2022, Western Kentucky University.

Status of Research, Intervention Strategies and Future Directions: A Rapid Review","Introduction Ghana like other African countries is facing multiple health threats due to expansion of urban populations. Globally, the urbanization phenomenon has received considerable attention and modest steps have been undertaken to address it. Ghana is stalling on implementation of policies and interventions targeted at alleviating the menace. Objectives This review examined research evidence, interventions, and policies relating to urbanization and threats to health and well-being of people living in Ghana. The review focused on three areas including urbanization threats to health and well-being, health risks associated with urbanization, and interventions and policies. Materials and Methods The search spanned from year 2000 to February 2022 covering documents related to urbanization, health, and well-being. Databases used for the search include African Journals Online, Annual Reviews (Biomedical, Life & Physical sciences, Social Sciences), BioMedCentral, BioOne, BLDS digital library, Cambridge University Press, ClinicalKey, CINAHL, University of Ghana Digital Collections/UGSpace, JSTOR, Medline and Wiley Online Library. Results Environmental risk factors, urban planning, water-related, behavior-related, and socioeconomic factors were important urbanization threats to health and well-being. Health risks identified include airborne diseases, waterborne diseases, malaria, and non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and lung cancer. Additionally, there is evidence of non-implementation and/or non-enforcement of existing interventions and policies. Conclusion and Recommendation Evidence from this rapid review shows that urbanization impacts on health and well-being of people in Ghana. Urbanization threats that expose populations to health risks could be reduced through commitment to implementation, surveillance and monitoring of policies and interventions.

The survey was conducted by scholars of the Institute of Pedagogy of the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine. The article is based on the legislative and regulatory documents governing the legal regime of martial law in Ukraine and the peculiarities of the functioning of the Ukrainian education system during this period; analytical works, including the author’s own, on the organization of education under martial law; characteristics of primary education: The guidelines of international organizations on the organization of education in times of war were also taken into account. The results of the survey showed that primaryeducation in Ukraine continued to function after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia, despite serious challenges (destruction or damage to educational institutions due to bombing and shelling, forced displacement of teachers and parents with children, numerous psychological traumas of teachers and children, occupation of part of the territory of Ukraine and genocide of the Ukrainian people in the occupied territories). This became possible both due to the creation of the foundations of institutional and legal regulation of the educational sphere for the period of martial law by the Ukrainian authorities, and to the specialists of primary education: their civic position, moral responsibility, professional qualifications. The conclusions developed on the basis of the respondents’ answers outline possible options for organizing primary education in war conditions.

35a19b6b727ca3e3c10625a0736b965ffc6e80c9,Infection timing affects Fusarium poae colonization of bread wheat spikes and mycotoxin accumulation in the grain,"Abstract BACKGROUND Fusarium poae is one of the most common Fusarium head blight (FHB) causal agents in wheat. This species can biosynthesize a wide range of mycotoxins, in particular nivalenol (NIV). In FHB epidemiology, infection timing is important for disease occurrence, kernel development, symptom appearance and mycotoxin accumulation in grain. The present study explored, both in a controlled environment and in a 2‐year field plot experiment in Central Italy, the influence of five infection timings (from beginning of flowering to medium milk growth stage) on F. poae colonization and mycotoxin accumulation in bread wheat spikes (spring cv. A416 and winter cv. Ambrogio). RESULTS Both climate chamber and field experiments showed that early infection timings (from beginning of flowering to full flowering) especially favoured F. poae colonization and accumulation of its mycotoxins (particularly NIV) in grain. By contrast, later infection timings (watery ripe and medium milk) reduced F. poae development and mycotoxin levels. The time window of host susceptibility in the field was shorter than that observed under controlled conditions. Symptom expression in kernels also differed among infection timings. In general, F. poae biomass was higher in the chaff than in the grain. CONCLUSION These results enhance knowledge of a common member of the FHB complex worldwide, and could be useful in forecasting the risk of F. poae infection and mycotoxin contamination. © 2022 The Authors.

bc1f990d5f32d696088c065b9bde16ccd2bf42dc,CHARACTERIZATION OF VEGETATION AND PREDICTION OF BIOMASS PRODUCTION IN SILAGE CORN CROP BASED ON SATELLITE IMAGES,"The study used methods based on remote sensing to analyze the dynamics of a silage corn crop and predict biomass production. The corn crop, the Micado hybrid, was organized within the Didactic and Experimental Station of the ""King Mihai I"" University of Life Sciences in Timisoara, under the specific conditions of the 2021-2022 agricultural year. The soil in the crop plot was of chernozem type, and the crop was in a non-irrigated system. To obtain the satellite data, the Sentinel 2 system was used. To characterize the plot and the crop of silage corn, 14 sets of images were taken, in the interval March - July 2022. From the analysis of the images, the spectral data were obtained, and based on the consecrated formulas MSAVI, NDMI, NDVI and NBR indexes were calculated. The ANOVA test confirmed the reliability of the data and the presence of variance in the data set (F>Fcrit, p<0.001, for Alpha=0.001). The level of correlations identified between the calculated indices was between r=0.967 (NBR with NDVI) and r=0.996 (NDVI with MSAVI). The variation of the NBR index, in relation to the other indices, was described by linear equations, in terms of statistical safety (R2=0.965, p<0.001, in relation to MSAVI; R2=0.989, p<0.001 in relation to NDMI; R2=0.934, p<0.001 in relation to NDVI). The variation of indices in relation to time (t, days) during the study period was described by polynomial equations of the 3rd degree, in terms of statistical safety (R2=0.964 for MSAVI, R2=0.934 for NDMI, R2=0.941 for NDVI, and R2=0.961 for NBR). Regression analysis facilitated obtaining some equations, as models for predicting biomass production, under conditions of statistical safety. Based on the RMSEP parameter, it was found that the most reliable level of production prediction was obtained in the case of MSAVI and NDMI indices (RMSEP=0.05923).

The present study aimed to evaluate the methodological quality of systematic reviews of in-vitro dental studies. Methods We searched for systematic reviews of in-vitro dental studies in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases published up to January 2022. We assessed the methodological quality of the systematic reviews using a modified “A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews” (AMSTAR-2) instrument. The 16 items, in the form of questions, were answered with yes, no, or py (partial yes). Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association between systematic review characteristics and AMSTAR-2 percent score. Overall confidence in the results of the systematic reviews was rated, based on weaknesses identified in critical and non-critical AMSTAR-2 items. Results The search retrieved 908 potential documents, and after following the eligibility criteria, 185 systematic reviews were included. The most researched topics were ceramics and dental bonding. The overall rating for the confidence in the results was critically low in 126 (68%) systematic reviews. There was high variability in the response among the AMSTAR-2 items (0% to 75% positively answered). The univariable analyses indicated dental specialty ( p  = 0.03), number of authors (coef: 1.87, 95% CI: 0.26, 3.47, p  = 0.02), and year of publication (coef: 2.64, 95% CI: 1.90, 3.38, p  < 0.01) were significantly associated with the AMSTAR-2 percent score. Whereas, in the multivariable analysis only specialty ( p  = 0.01) and year of publication (coef: 2.60, 95% CI: 1.84, 3.35, p  < 0.001) remained significant. Among specialties, endodontics achieved the highest AMSTAR-2 percent score. Conclusions The methods of systematic reviews of in vitro dental studies were suboptimal.

Chronic physical health conditions (CPHC) of children affect the whole family. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to compare levels of internalizing, externalizing, and total problems as well as self-esteem/positive self-concept and prosocial behavior of the healthy siblings with children from families not affected by CPHC and test norms, respectively.


METHODS
A systematic search for literature was conducted using the electronic data bases CINAHL, PsycInfo, PubMed, PSYNDEX, and Web of Science. In total, results from 216 studies were included in random-effects meta-analyses that had been published or made available online before February 15, 2022.


RESULTS
Healthy siblings of children with CPHC had elevated levels of internalizing (g = .18 standard deviation units), externalizing (g = .13), and total behavior problems (g = .22), and effect sizes were found to be small to very small. While levels of self-esteem did, on average, not vary between healthy children with and without a sibling with CPHC or test norms (g = .08), higher levels of prosocial behavior were found in the healthy siblings of children with CPHC (g = .18). In addition, some moderating effects of kind of CPHC and its intrusiveness as well as mortality risk, country, sociodemographic equivalence of the compared groups, and year of publication were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
It is concluded that CPHC of a child can have negative as well as positive effects on psychosocial outcomes of healthy siblings. Psychosocial interventions are recommended for healthy siblings at elevated risk for psychological problems.",Journal of Pediatric Psychology,2022.0,14,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/jpepsy/jsac066?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsac066, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Soybean aphid resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides emerged in 2015; however, the reduction in the efficacy of field applications of pyrethroid insecticides has not been quantified. Based on time‐series data from insecticide efficacy trials at two locations, a novel approach of continuous two‐phase change point‐regression models was used to indicate whether a change in percent control had occurred, and to provide an indication of when and to what degree the percent control had changed. Results At both locations examined in this study, a significant change point for percent control of λ‐cyhalothrin was detected in 2014, thus marking the onset of practical resistance in the soybean aphid. Percent control decreased at a rate of 4.30% and 19.90% per year at these locations. By contrast, percent control for chlorpyrifos remained high over time with no significant change point. Conclusion This research demonstrates that retrospective time‐series analysis of insecticide efficacy data can identify the onset and magnitude of practical resistance in the field. This further validates and compliments the other lines of evidence related to pyrethroid resistance in soybean aphid. © 2022 The Authors.

8c49318a65b30ec2142a3c4cecc151e499400e5e,Reducing Bias in Wikipedia’s Coverage of Political Scientists,"One in five political scientists with biographies on Wikipedia are women and almost half are American. Biases onWikipedia can cause real harm, so I created or expanded a political science–related Wikipedia article every day for a year, focusing on writing new pages about political scientists from underrepresented groups. This article shows that Wikipedia’s coverage of political scientists remains skewed by gender and nationality, and I suggest ways for political scientists to improve Wikipedia’s representation of the discipline. Anyone can write an article on Wikipedia, including a biography of another person, but an overwhelming proportion of these biographies are about men from wealthy countries. This has prompted a type of digital activism: for almost as long as Wikipedia has existed, there have been collective efforts to make its coverage of people fairer (Redden 2016).1 Almost a decade of work has focused specifically on increasing the proportion of biographies about women in science (Wade and Zaringhalam 2018). However, whereas thousands of new pages have been written about underrepresented natural scientists, medical researchers, and engineers, Wikipedia’s treatment of social scientists has not received the same level of attention. Yet, Wikipedia’s coverage of social sciences suffers from the same problems as its coverage of natural and medical sciences. Adams, Brückner, and Naslund (2019) found that sociologists who are men or who are white are disproportionately likely to be the subject of a biography onWikipedia, and Schellekens, Holstege, and Yasseri (2019) identified similar gender gaps among pages about economists, physicists, and philosophers. As Alter et al. (2020) argued, and as Ackerly and Michelitch (2022) discuss in this symposium, there is reason to expect that these biases also would apply to political scientists. Tomatch the estimated proportion of women among full-time political scientists in the United States, Wikipedia’s biographies of women in political science would need to appear at almost double the overall proportion of Wikipedia biographies about women (APSA 2011).2 These types of biases echo the enduring problems in political science. Gender gaps have been consistently identified in political science citations, syllabi, and books, whereas the academic study of politics historically has focused on a small number of wealthy countries (Dion and Mitchell 2019; Wilson and Knutsen 2020). The prominent initiativesWomen Also Know Stuff and People of Color Also Know Stuff were motivated partly by a closely related bias: publications and events about politics are less likely to include experts who are white women or people of color (Beaulieu et al. 2017; Lemi, Osorio, and Rush 2019). Like other types of bias in the discipline, biased coverage on Wikipedia can have serious effects. In a typical month, Wikipedia articles about politics are viewed hundreds of millions of times.3 Experiments demonstrate that text on highly viewed Wikipedia pages can affect outcomes from the way that scientific topics are described in academic papers to the revenue of tourist destinations (Hinnosaar et al. 2017; Thompson and Hanley 2018). Researchers specifically argue that biased coverage of a profession on Wikipedia can discourage people from joining that profession due to an absence of visible role models (Hinnosaar 2019; Wade and Zaringhalam 2018). To address these issues, I undertook a year-long project to reduce bias among political science–relatedWikipedia articles, in which I focused on gender and regional disparities in biographies about political scientists. Every day in 2020, I created or expanded a Wikipedia article about a political scientist from an underrepresented group. How productive were these efforts, and how much work remains before Wikipedia biographies of political scientists are a fair representation of the field? First, I describe the distributions of gender and nationality among Wikipedia pages about political scientists. I then discuss the limitations of an individual effort like mine that aims to address a systemic problem. Finally, I provide concrete suggestions for how others can contribute.",PS: Political Science & Politics,2022.0,5,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049096521001207', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/S1049096521001207?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096521001207, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The biotechnological importance of these fungi has inspired research worldwide. Through scientometrics methods, it is possible to verify tendencies and gaps in different research area, collaborating with academic society to foster new studies and correlations. To identify the production of scientific knowledge relating to biological activity within endophytic fungi, we performed a survey on the platform Web of Science from studies published between 1997 and 2019 that have the following terms in the title, summary, or keywords: (Fung* AND Endophytic) AND (Bioprospecting OR Bio-prospecting OR Prospecting OR Bioactivit* OR “Biological Activit*”). A total of 458 studies were obtained, of which the following information was verified: publication year; average citations per year; journal; h-index of the journal; area of concentration; keyword and cooccurrence between them; network of collaboration between countries, institutions, and journals; bioassays realized and biological activity verified among endophytic fungi. China represents the nation-state that most frequently hosts research, followed by Brazil and India. According to our findings, the period between 2016 and 2019 showed an increase in the number of bioassays, nearly half of which (43%) proved to have antimicrobial activity, followed by anti-tumor activity (29%). These properties show that endophytic fungi can produce bioactive molecules of pharmaceutical and agronomic interest.

8d280c26f8a85ad27adf62eb388dc1492e7a9740,Determinants of low birth weight: a systematic review,"More than 80% of neonatal deaths that occur in newborns are caused by Low Birth Weight (LBW). This increases the risk of several health problems, such as susceptibility to infections, chronic non-communicable developmental diseases, and growth and intellectual disability that may occur during infancy, childhood, and the later stages of life. Therefore it is necessary to reduce the prevalence of LBW to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The purpose of this study was to determine the determinants of LBW through a systematic review. The method used in the systematic review study was searching through the Pubmed, ProQuest, and Science Direct databases with the year of publication from January 2012 to January 2022. The results of almost all articles were obtained, which said that the motherâ€™s nutritional status, maternal age, anemia, hypertension of pregnancy, parity, ANC, and smoking affect LBW. Two factors greatly influence the seventh factor: the ANC visit factor and the mother's nutritional status. It is essential to regularly check for pregnancy as early as possible so it can be detected early.

9f63ac1c975189d096e74517ab217dde53138806,The Pomeps Virtual Research Workshop,"DOI:10.1017/S1049096522000270 In June 2020, the Project on Middle East Political Science (POMEPS) launched a virtual research workshop for junior scholars to fill the void left by the cancelation of so many conferences and workshops due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 2021–2022 academic year, we expanded the virtual workshop dramatically to include 18 workshops dedicated to book manuscripts or journal-article manuscripts. Because of the format’s flexibility, efficiency, and advantages for diversity and inclusion, we plan to continue it even when travel becomes possible again. There are costs and risks, however, that require attention. Overall, the move to virtual research workshops has been a resounding success. Since its launch, POMEPS has conducted 24 workshops, including 82 junior-scholar authors and 58 seniorscholar discussants. Each two-hour article workshop typically features three papers, each with one assigned discussant. The authors are asked to read the other two papers, whereas discussants may but are not required to do so. As the convener and moderator, I read all of the papers and provide a second set of comments to supplement the assigned discussant. Book workshops, which are more intense, typically last 90 minutes for one paper or three hours for two papers on related themes. Each book manuscript has two dedicated readers, in addition to myself and typically one other member of the selection committee. We conducted 11 virtual bookworkshops for the 2021–2022 academic year. The buy-in from theMiddle East political science (and broader Middle East studies) community has been phenomenal. Although we cannot offer honoraria, almost all invited discussants usually agree to participate. If they are unavailable, they often offer suggestions for alternatives—which is useful when the topics of the papers or books are outside of the organizers’ areas of expertise. A Zoom meeting will never be as much fun as an in-person seminar, but the relatively small size of the group keeps everyone engaged and allows for personal interactions. Authors do not present their manuscript, assuming that it has been read in advance, which maintains a high level of engagement because there are few long spans of only listening. The virtual format allows us to more fully include scholars based in theMiddle East and Europe, for whom it otherwisemight be prohibitively expensive and pose complicated visa issues. We can offer invitations without regard to physical distance or national location. As a result, scholars from the Middle East and Europe who otherwise might have been excluded for logistical or cost reasons can participate at a high level: 40 of the 82 article authors and eight of the 11 book authors participated from outside of the United States. This also allows us to forego extensive advance planning, travel arrangements and logistics, andmultiday disruptions. The selection process actively seeks applicants from outside of the usual elite institutional networks, on the assumption that junior scholars from top schools already have support from their institution and are networked into the scholarly community. POMEPS has definite plans to continue these workshops even after the world heals; however, there are disadvantages to the format. In general, we have not heard the common complaint that online sessions are alienating, non-interactive, or unproductive. The small size and engagement-oriented organization has resulted in dynamic and productive sessions. Zoom burnout is real, however. We have found that a session lasting more than a few hours is difficult to sustain, even for the most dedicated of us. Time zones also have been an issue—we sometimes struggle to find workable times for participants who might be calling in from the West Coast of the United States and from Doha, Qatar. Moreover, there is no substitute for the informal time after inperson workshops sharing cocktails or dinner or an evening walk through a new city. We are concerned that the ease of virtual workshops will lead to a two-tier system in which non-U.S. based scholars benefit from feedback and professional development but remain excluded from the more informal social benefits of inperson events. A more significant concern about the potential for a selfdestructive dynamic is the tendency to overschedule because it is so easy and inexpensive to do so. The sheer volume of workshops enabled by the virtual format can be overwhelming, not only for the organizer who reads and comments on all of the papers almost weekly but also for the larger community. If we exhaust the pool of plausible readers and return multiple times to the same senior scholars, at some point, their enthusiasm for being a discussant inevitably will wane. Furthermore, it is possible that funders will observe the success of online models and become unwilling to fund the more expensive and unwieldy in-person events. That would be very disappointing because many new ideas and enduring partnerships are developed in those informal spaces of inperson conferences and workshops.▪",PS: Political Science & Politics,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/s1049096522000270?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049096522000270, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 390 undergraduate (2 nd to 6 th year) medical students from two different public faculties of medicine in Western Saudi Arabia, during October 2021 to February 2022. The level of learning motivation was assessed using the Student’s Motivation Towards Science Learning (SMTSL). Socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health-related factors, as well as the perceived academic impact of COVID-19 were analyzed as the determinants of motivation. Additionally, the level of social support received by the student during the pandemic was assessed using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and was analyzed as a factor for motivation. Results: The mean (SD) overall SMTSL score was 117.25 (19.60) out of 175, and the histogram showed a right-skewed distribution curve indicating tendency for higher scores. SMTSL behaved as a tridimensional scale in Principal Component Analysis. The highest levels of negative impact of COVID-19 were perceived on the actual acquisition of practical skills (36.9%), followed by transition from student to doctor (24.4%), and academic goals (22.3%). Paradoxically, 51.1% perceived a positive impact on their overall interest and involvement in medical studies. Low motivation level was independently associated with MSPSS score (OR=0.96, 95% CI=0.94–0.97), history of COVID-19 infection among relatives (OR=0.40, 95%C=0.23–0.68), and perceived negative impact on career expectation (OR=3.26, 95%CI=1.74–6.13). Conclusion: The impact of COVID-19 crisis on learning motivation is determined by the level of social support received and sense of duty and responsibility among the medical student.

f1ae3b3ec2596c67b63b4e306c654c2df38ad32b,Introductory words,"Since 2014, the PUBMET international conference has served as a significant venue for gathering editors, publishers, librarians, journalists, policymakers, scholars and practitioners investigating and advancing scholarly communication in open science. The ninth PUBMET2022 conference was held at the University of Zadar from 14 to 16 September 2022, continuing a series of very successful conferences organised by the University of Zadar, Croatian Association for Scientific Communication - ZNAK, University of Zagreb, University of Rijeka and Ruđer Bošković Institute, under the auspices of the OPERAS consortium, OpenAIRE, the European Association of Science Editors (EASE) and SPARC Europe.We are happy that after two years of holding the conference online, we met again in person to discuss the latest developments in scientific communication and its most visible part, scientific publishing, and to share our knowledge, visions, expertise and the outcomes of numerous studies in this interdisciplinary field. This year we have seen the development and application of the principles of open science and open access as a prerequisite for achieving innovative scientific communication. Sharing all outputs in the earliest stages of research, including research data, software, protocols, methods, laboratory notes, reviewers’ reports, and publications, is the basis for the accelerated development of responsible science.This year’s PUBMET2022 has brought us a series of invited lectures, short presentations, panel discussions, posters, and workshops, discussing the progress of open science and promoting transparent and informed reporting on the results of scientific research. PUBMET2022 is the result of the year-long hard work of the programme and organising committees. Our excellent speakers, poster presenters, panellists, workshop leaders and moderators contributed to the conference’s success with their valuable, carefully selected and peer-reviewed content. In addition, more than 300 registered participants from 42 countries attended the conference in person or online, providing exciting questions and comments and sharing their opinions.Major themes of PUBMET2022 include:▸ Redesigning of open access - what can the scientific community do to retain rights over their research results, and what are the alternatives to the high fees for publishing in open access;▸ Raising efficiency and effectiveness in scholarly communication - changes that have been achieved by applying the principles of open science bring numerous advantages for scholars, but raise some new challenges;▸ The fairness of open science – transparency, responsibility, equity, diversity and cooperation in creating and sharing knowledge must be uncompromising;▸ Potentials of public engagement in science - how can research results make a more significant and positive impact on society?;▸ Assessing the quality of the research process, research outputs and publication channels - how does open science change the traditional quantitative research assessment criteria?",PUBMET - Conference Scholarly Publishing Context Open Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://morepress.unizd.hr/journals/index.php/pubmet/article/download/3969/4703', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15291/pubmet.3969?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15291/pubmet.3969, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The International Journal of Cosmetic Science was established in 1979 and has continuously improved to reach its current high academic standing. In 2022, with an impact factor of 2.461, the journal is ranked at number 40 of the 69 journals that are grouped as ‘Dermatology’ publications and is also the leading ‘peer review’ journal in cosmetics. Close to 12 000 institutions offer access to IJCS via a Wiley licence and more than 500 000 full texts were downloaded last year. The stated aims of the International Journal of Cosmetic Science are ‘to present current scientific research, both pure and applied in cosmetics, toiletries, perfumery and allied fields’. The instruction to authors also states that ‘articles should have a clear connection to and usefulness for cosmetics applications’. Science progresses by trial and error, by contradictory debates, and consensus has no place. If a scientific thesis does not permit debate, it is because it is pseudoscience which is under the control of an ideology. The AntiAgeing Conference and the International Journal of Cosmetic Science give you the opportunity to express yourself and share your ideas, knowledge and research by different but complementary means and both at a high scientific level. There is an opportunity to initiate a partnership between the AntiAgeing Conference and the IJCS at this year's AntiAgeing Conference in London in November. A strong alliance would be of mutual benefit, synergistic and aid in the promotion of scientific excellence in the important field of Skincare.

74528c4b5201da43fd0853fe942314bdc2e823d1,COP26: how much real progress?,"The spotlight, pressure and urgency was on COP26 like no previous climate meeting to demonstrate progress and achieve agreements. After the hype, headlines, protests and promises, what has really changed? Few would disagree that more progress had been made at this than any previous COP, but then there can also be little doubt that the commitments made were nowhere near sufficient to take us off a seriously worrying course of entwined climate, environment and societal crises. Many scientists think that if the new agreements are followed then global warming by the end of the century might reach +2.4°C instead of +2.7°C clearly a substantial shift in the right direction, but far short of what is required. Notable, high-profile announcements were made on ending deforestation (but by 2030), phasing down of coal and removal of 'inefficient' fossil fuel subsidies, and 2030 national targets were requested for just one year later (2022). Many of these progress points began with proposals that, arguably, used harder-hitting terminology, but were later amended under pressure from nations and other bodies with, from their point of view, more to lose. New finance agreements, with some richer nations promising to double contributions to support the climate adaptation of poorer countries, may sound robust, but they can also be seen in a context of previous and similar commitments having not been met, despite expressions of 'deep regrets'. Given the opportunity to attend as a polar biological scientist speaking on behalf of an environmental charity, I was pleased to see and hear greater emphasis than has previously been apparent on the environment. Over the last few decades, the scientific literature has explodedwith evidence highlighting thewide variety, intensity and severity of climate impacts on the natural environment from the tropics to the poles, land to oceans and microbes to megabiota. Yet nature has long been and is a major modifierof climate, not least through drawdown, storage and sequestration of carbon (from the atmospheric greenhouse gas CO2). Through multiple and interacting stressors, many carbon sinks have now started to become significant carbon sources, even the largest remaining rainforest. Drawing on a wide literature base, a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)-sponsored report urged a more synergistic approach to addressing these climate, nature and societal crises. Very strong emphasis was placed on contributions to be made by (and losses avoided by) the better protection, restoration and management of carbonand species-rich environments. These provide many, and highly efficient, key ecosystem services (nature's benefits), especially when meaningful protection is targeted on near-intact systems and includes long-term planning. High-profile goals of protection have been set, such as '30by30' (30% protected area by 2030), but the reality is we are far from achieving that on land, the ocean lags far behind the land and the polar latitudes are perhaps the least protected of all. Ocean warming around Antarctica has actually increased some carbon sinks in areas of seasonal sea-ice loss, where ice-shelf collapses have occurred and where fjords are emerging as glaciers retreat. However, these little-recognized but important, mitigating feedbacks on climate, along with other global 'blue carbon' marine habitats (e.g. mangroves, seagrass, salt marshes and macroalgae) and terrestrial sinks, particularly peatlands, can only help if they are properly safeguarded through adequate protection and their ongoing losses from lower latitudes despite restoration efforts show that we are not doing enough. For all of the discussion of limiting climate change together and tackling a global problem, there was still much combative and competitive national hunkering down into target-setting and debating what constitutes 'emissions' in reporting. Despite Greta Thunberg's comment that politicians and national representatives had cut 'the blah blah blah', this (rather than action) still seemed much in evidence. Much of our planet (most of the ocean) is beyond national jurisdiction and clearly risks being neglected in a system of nationally determined contributions. Much of the push towards 'carbon net zero' involves offsetting, but we already know that up to 90% of carbon offsetting has little or no real impact, while many assessments avoid the issue of whole-lifetime carbon cost. We must, as individuals and nations, become more honest because we are currently deceiving ourselves, to our own loss. Nature protection is sometimes 'sold' as an offset, even when no obvious threat is being mitigated and hence no additional climate mitigation is being provided. By contrast, potentially important, unprotected carbon sinks may stay low on protection agendas because protecting them does not create new (additional) carbon sequestration that was not there before, and so this does not count towards a nation's emissions reduction targets. With the current urgency of our state of affairs, we cannot accept a situation in which losing intact carbon sinks and attempting to restore others is better rewarded than protection of intact habitat (which is likely to achieve doi:10.1017/S0954102022000098",Antarctic Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7D3CD5E6DA690B8CEE6CDF2F146A8736/S0954102022000098a.pdf/div-class-title-cop26-how-much-real-progress-div.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/s0954102022000098?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954102022000098, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Predicting drought impact on the Caspian Sea coast affected by climate change. Environmental Sciences. 20(2): 99-116. Results and discussion: The results obtained from the output of this index in the monitoring period and future periods with different time scales show that the intensity of drought in the coming decades will increase compared to the monitoring period. This increase is more severe for the east of the Caspian Sea, so that the intensity of the drought in the 2080s will be three times more than the observation period. The results indicated that the climate change results in an increase in the frequency and severity of drought in the studied region. Findings of the present research indicate that in spite of the existence of variability in the SPI lower than 9 months, it has increased 25 and 23.5% in longer periods of 1 to 2 year periods in comparison with the historical period. The incompatibility of drought simulated in the future with observation period in Gorgan station with four remaining stations of the southern regions of the Caspian Sea should be noted. This situation may be due to differences in the resources of precipitation in the eastern and western coasts of the Caspian Sea and different response of two regions against the global warming. Previous studies indicated that the Caspian Sea west coasts are more affected by the northerly flows of Siberian high pressure system than its east coasts, and in case of the establishment of the high pressure over Caspian Sea, precipitations in the west of the Caspian Sea will be higher than its eastern region. The phenomenon of global warming has resulted in weakening of the Siberian high pressure system in general. Therefore, degree of the reduction in precipitations in central and western regions of the Caspian Sea will be relatively higher than in its eastern regions such as Gorgan station. Conclusion: Occurrence of successive droughts and increasing drought intensity in the coming decades of the southern Caspian coastal areas will reduce water resources and the region-based economy will face a more severe crisis, in which case water resources management and development of strategic irrigation document and cultivation pattern a region compatible with socio-economic and climatic trends seems absolutely necessary.",Environmental Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://envs.sbu.ac.ir/article_102133_2e585b9baafdab78fafd5b71c4e78cf3.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.52547/envs.2022.1038?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.52547/envs.2022.1038, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is noted that from the 2022/2023 academic year, the gradual implementation of the State Standard of Basic Secondary Education will begin, accordingly, students of general secondary education institutions, in particular 6th grade, will switch to a new learning model, a component of which is a new system for evaluating students' educational achievements. It is indicated that taking into account the experience of formative assessment in elementary school and ensuring continuity in assessment approaches is important for the implementation of the tasks of geographic education in all cycles of education. Separate techniques and tools of formative assessment that can be used in geography lessons are singled out and analyzed. Examples of exercises that are used at different stages of the lesson during formative assessment are given, including the games ""Play in groups with a map"", ""Catch the cartographer's mistake"", ""Find the extra word"". It is noted that in the process of teaching geography and evaluating the educational achievements of students, the teacher can use such techniques of written control as: geographical dictation with mutual control, ""blitz control"", ""self-checking on the informant's card"", solving crosswords. To establish the expediency of using crosswords as a formative assessment of educational achievements, a survey of 9th grade students was conducted, the results of which indicate an interest in this type of control. Non-traditional forms and methods of testing students' knowledge and skills using computer technologies, which can serve as a tool for formative assessment, are considered. Our observations of students' activity confirm the feasibility of using separate online services in geography lessons for formative assessment of both the learning process and the result of students' educational achievements. In particular, the use of such online services with the use of test verification is effective for testing students' knowledge of geography. as ""For Lesson""; Kahoot!; Online Test Pad, as well as Gartic Phone game technologies.

It negatively affect normal growth and development of children thereby reducing their genetic potential. The purpose of this study was to analyze the cause of rickets in children under five years and solutions available. 
Methodology: This study employed a descriptive cross-sectional approach and was conducted in the pediatric outpatients department of the Guru Tegh Bahadur (GTB) Hospital & University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS) Delhi. The study period was one year from September 2021 to September 2022 on 130 diagnosed cases of the rickets. Patients were enrolled via non- probability convenient sampling technique and a set developed inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data was collected through self-structured questionnaire after taking informed consent. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 26. 
Findings: The study found out that giving getting enough of both vitamin D and calcium is crucial to maintaining bone health and protecting against disorders like osteoporosis, a condition that is characterized by weak, brittle bones. While the daily value (DV) of vitamin D is 800 IU per day, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) differs slightly depending on your age. Children and adults ages 1–70 need approximately 600 IU of vitamin D per day. This can come from a combination of food sources and sunlight. Adults over 70 should aim for at least 800 IU (20 mcg) of vitamin D per day. The RDA for calcium also varies by age. Children ages 4–8 need about 1,000 mg of calcium daily. Children ages 9–18 need approximately 1,300 mg daily. Adults ages 19–50 need about 1,000 mg daily. Over the age of 50, most people need 1,200 mg per day. 
Conclusion: The study conclude that children aged between one and three years are more susceptible to rickets than children between four and five years. The study also conclude that lower socioeconomic background, male gender, exclusive breastfeeding, unbalanced nutrition and mother’s poor nutritional status all contribute to high incidences of rickets in children under five years. Vitamin D is necessary for calcium absorption in your body. This plays a key role in maintaining bone strength and skeletal integrity. 
Recommendations: Supplements should be added in the diet of children during breastfeeding. Also, there should be adequate sunlight exposure of children.

In recent years, it performs the link between the oceangoing Maritime Silk Road and the land-based Silk Road to promote a national policy of “One Belt and One Road”. In order to fully understand global academic hot spots and the corresponding trajectory in the research of the grand canal culture belt from 1976 to 2022, the literature review is based on 256 publications from ISI Web of Science, 4944 bibliographic records retrieved from China Academic Journals Full-Text Database, 472 articles under the theme of the cultural economy from Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index, and visualized by the scientometric software of CiteSpace. Meanwhile, comparisons of research areas with canal studies in both China and other global famous canals are implemented, including the Grand Canal of China, the Venice Canal of Italy, the Panama Canal of Panama, the Colorado River of the USA, the Nile Delta of Egypt, Nicaragua Canal of USA, Welland Canal of Canada , especially four canal studies cases on keywords and knowledge clusters: Grand Canal of China, Venice Canal of Italy, Nile Delta of Egypt, Rhine-Marne Canal of France.

5d8d29e4ec2109b80b63290f76e7c086f7b892ac,Polyrotaxanes and the pump paradigm.,"The year 2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the first reports of polyrotaxanes in the scientific literature. During the past three decades, many combinations of molecular rings and polymer chains have been synthesised and characterised. Until recently, however, the permutations of polyrotaxanes available to researchers were limited by synthetic methods which typically relied on an innate affinity between the molecular rings and polymer chains. With the advent of oligorotaxane-forming molecular pumps in 2015, it has now become possible to pump multiple rings against their will onto oligomer and polymer chains which have little or no affinity for the rings. These molecular pumps, which can recruit rings actively from solution to form precise polyrotaxanes, represent a major breakthrough in the field. This Tutorial Review highlights key milestones in the synthesis and investigation of polyrotaxanes along with recent developments in the synthesis and theory relating to molecular pumps. Polyrotaxane properties, arising from their topologies, have allowed them to steal a march on traditional polymers in a wide range of applications in materials, electronic and biological science, from slide-ring gels to robust coatings on cell phones, from molecular wires to flexible binders for battery anodes, from efficient multivalent protein binders to bio-cleavable polyplexes for cellular DNA delivery. Molecular pumps have the potential to blaze a contemporary trail for the synthesis of precise mechanically interlocked materials, especially those dependent on non-equilibrium chemistry and those related to energy storage and nanomedicine.",Chemical Society Reviews,2022.0,8,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1039/d2cs00194b?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1039/d2cs00194b, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The scope and actuality of this concept, which expresses a new digital world beyond the universe, necessitated this study. In thisstudy, gender, age, duration of social media usage and levels of metaverse knowledge, awareness, attitude of university students were tried to be analyzed statistically in terms of variables such as playing digital games, using e-commerce, communicating with other individuals in virtual channels and the availability of crypto money.Methods and Materials: In the study, the survey model, one of the quantitative research methods, was preferred. Independent Sample T Test and Pearson Correlation tests were used to analyze data with a normal distribution. The population of the research includes students studying at Ağrı İbrahim Çeçen University, Faculty of Sport Sciences in the 2021-2022 academic year, and the sample group consists of 271 students, 122 Gender and 149 male, studying in different departments of the same faculty. Apart from the personal information form, ‘Metaverse Scale’ developed by Süleymanoğulları et al. was used as a data collection tool.Findings: According to the results, the metaverse knowledge, attitude, and awareness levels of male participants are higher than Genders in the sub-dimensions of digitalization and lifestyle. While a positive and weak relationship was found between the participants’ average daily social media usage time and the technology sub-dimension average score, the analysis results indicate the levels of the participants who engage in e-commerce in the technology, digitalization, and lifestyle sub-dimensions are higher. Finally, it has been found that the metaverse knowledge, attitude and awareness levels of the students who have crypto money in the sub-dimensions of technology, digitalization and lifestyle are higher than those in the other group.Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it can be said that the metaverse attitudes, awarenessand knowledge levels of the university students who constitute the sample group of the research differ depending on sociocultural and socioeconomic factors.",Journal of Educational Technology and Online Learning,2022.0,9,"{'url': 'https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/2567230', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31681/jetol.1151470?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31681/jetol.1151470, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

16a1d3f991ffb46e6af641f122d4934d52579e9d,A Bibliometric Analysis of Mandatory Corporate Social Responsibility using RStudio: Based on Scopus Database,"



Purpose: CSR in India has been the focus of many researchers. This paper aims to map the intellectual structure of mandatory CSR research, identifying influential authors and journals, current and evolving issues, and future research direction.
 
Design/Methodology/Approach: Using the RStudio package, a bibliometric analysis of 130 articles is conducted in mandatory CSR by extracting data from the Scopus database for ten years (2012-2022).
 
Findings: The main results show the first article was published in 2012, and over 85% of articles have been published in the last five years. In 2021, 33 articles were published; in 2022, it published 34 articles, a new peak. The result shows that ""Social Responsibility Journal"" is the most productive journal, and 2021 is the most productive year; Bhattacharyya A, Kansal M, Rahman ML, and Ray S is the most contributing author.
 
Practical implications: This article is to analyze the prominent trends in the journal concerning papers, authors, institutions, nations, journals, subjects, and keywords. The results of this study will help readers obtain a complete comprehension of the publication.
 
Originality:  Since CSR was made mandatory in 2014 in India and other countries, hardly any study has done a bibliometric analysis on mandatory CSR.
 
Limitations: Scopus is the only source of the database used; other databases like the web of science, google scholar, etc., are not considered. The data is available only for ten years; from 2012 to 2022, only the keyword ""mandatory CSR"" is used for 130 articles

Human-caused deforestation was accused to be the reason behind this matter, apart from the drastic changing in global climate. Palangkaraya is one of the citiesaffected by haze of the forest fire in 2015; considered to be the worst year of forest fire with the value of PM10 was above the normal threshold. As the impact to the community wellbeing, the prevalence of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in October 2015was increasing especially in children. The research aimed to analyse the spatial distribution of children with ARI in October 2015 at Palangkaraya City. Data onARI number were collected from Primary Care under Public Health Office of Palangkaraya City. The PM 10 value was collected bythe Environmental Agency of Palangkaraya City. The spatial analyse method was conducted using theAverage Nearest Neighbour (ANN) method. The result shows that the number of ANN ratio is 0.761801. It means that the distribution pattern of children with ARI in Central Kalimantan during the forest fire in October 2015 was in cluster form.

However, the impact of frailty on survival and readmission patients with gastric cancer has not been well-characterised. Objectives To investigate the impact of frailty on survival and readmission in patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy by conducting a meta-analysis. Methods Eligible studies were identified by searching the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases until 2 September 2022. Observational studies that evaluated the value of frailty in predicting adverse outcomes in gastric cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy were included. The outcomes of interest were overall survival, disease-specific survival (death from gastric cancer), and readmission. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled to calculate the association of frailty with adverse outcomes. Results Eight studies reported on nine articles with 2,792 patients with gastric cancer were included. A fixed-effect meta-analysis indicated that frailty was associated with a reduced in-hospital overall survival (HR 2.08; 95% CI 1.46–2.95), long-term overall survival (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.37–2.47), and disease-specific survival (HR 1.94; 95% CI 1.34–2.83). In addition, frailty was associated with increased risk of readmission within 1 year (HR 3.63; 95% CI 1.87–7.06). Conclusions Frailty was associated with a reduced overall survival and disease-specific survival and an increased risk of readmission in patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy.

However, the indications and benefits of the two procedures still remain controversial. The present meta-analysis aimed to compare the surgical and oncological outcomes of DG and TG in the treatment of MTGC. A rigorous literature review was performed in the databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Chinese BioMedical Literature to retrieve studies published up to February 2022. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of included studies and a meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. A total of 12 retrospective studies performing comparisons of DG and TG were included in the present meta-analysis. For patients who underwent DG, a lower rate of overall post-operative complications, anastomosis leakage and intro-abdominal infection was determined. No significant difference was observed between DG and TG in the 5-year overall survival when the proximal resection margin ranged from 3 to 5 cm. Although DG was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival rate when compared to TG, there was no significant difference in the stratified analyses by TNM stage. In conclusion, the prognosis of MTGC did not depend on the extent of gastrectomy. With lower complications and acceptable oncological outcomes, DG was a safe and feasible surgical procedure for MTGC when a negative proximal margin was confirmed.",Oncology Letters,2022.0,8,"{'url': 'https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ol.2022.13411/download', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9353235, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods Design. Scoping review. Search strategy. The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews), guideline, was used to structure this study. A search strategy was carried out across six bibliographic databases. PubMed, Embase, ERIC, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science. The following search terms were used, “medical student*” AND “impact” AND “quarantine” AND “COVID-19”. Searches were initially confined to articles published (excluding conference abstracts) between 1 January 2019- 21 August 2021 but updated in September 2022 with the original search terms expanded to include “isolation” or “lockdown” as well as “quarantine” and the period of search extended to 21 August 2022. A search of secondary references was conducted. Data from the selected studies were extracted, and the following variables recorded; first author and year of publication, country of study, study design, sample size, participants, mode of analysing impact of quarantine from COVID-19 on mental health and results of the studies. Results A total of 223 articles were identified in the original search in 2021 and 387 articles, in the updated search in 2022. Following the exclusion of duplicates and application of the agreed inclusion and exclusion criteria, 31 full-text articles were identified for the final review, most of which were cross sectional studies. Sample sizes ranged from 13 to 4193 students and most studies used a variety of self-administered questionnaires to measure psychological wellbeing. Overall, 26 of the 31 articles showed that quarantine had a negative impact on the psychological well-being of medical students. However, two studies showed no impact, and three studies showed an improvement. Conclusion The evidence is growing. Quarantine because of the COVID-19 pandemic may have had a negative impact on the psychological wellbeing of medical students, but this is not certain.

Indeed, different oral and paraoral lesions, conditions and symptoms have been reported in patients with COVID-19. Experts thought that such oral lesions could be secondary to the COVID-19-associated deterioration of systemic health or due to treatments of COVID-19. We present here a case of a 24-year-old male presented with painful multiple ulcers involving the labial and buccal mucosae bilaterally after a while of feeling very mild symptoms that laboratory-confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to be COVID-19. Involvement of eyes was also reported. The above clinical presentation was consistent with minor erythema multiform. Many topical preparations were prescribed but with limited improvement. Hence, oral prednisolone was prescribed with a 40-mg loading dose that was tapered by 10 mg every 3 days. Complete healing of oral mucosa was observed on the 10 day. Strikingly, the patient got affected with the second episode of similar oral lesions 5 months later without any apparent triggering factors, suggestive a long term effects of COVID-19 in a subset of patients.

1890ebfab8388277de97f1814a88993027a4169b,Probing the Neutrino-Mass Scale with the KATRIN Experiment,"The absolute mass scale of neutrinos is an intriguing open question in contemporary physics. The as-yet-unknown mass of the lightest and, at the same time, most abundant massive elementary particle species bears fundamental relevance to theoretical particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The most model-independent experimental approach consists of precision measurements of the kinematics of weak decays, notably tritium β decay. With the KATRIN experiment, this direct neutrino-mass measurement has entered the sub-eV domain, recently pushing the upper limit on the electron-based neutrino mass down to 0.8 eV (90% CL) on the basis of first-year data out of ongoing, multiyear operations. Here, we review the experimental apparatus of KATRIN, the progress of data taking, and initial results. While KATRIN is heading toward the target sensitivity of 0.2 eV, other scientific goals are pursued. We discuss the search for light sterile neutrinos and an outlook on future keV-scale sterile-neutrino searches as well as further physics opportunities beyond the Standard Model.

d1c8bc3d82dc8e1001180435b1e5655845ecf460,Theory to Practice: Professional Development for Culturally Responsive Technician Education,"The HSI (Hispanic Serving Institution) ATE (Advanced Technological Education) Hub 2 is a three-year collaborative research project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) that continues the partnership between two successful programs and involves a third partner in piloting professional development that draws upon findings from the initial program. The goal of HSI ATE Hub 2 is to improve outcomes for Latinx students in technician education programs through design, development, pilot delivery, and dissemination of a 3-tier professional development (PD) model for culturally responsive technician education at 2-year Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). The project seeks to do this by developing the awareness and ability of faculty to appreciate, engage, and affirm the unique cultural identities of the students in their classes and use this connection to deepen students' belonging and emerging identities as STEM learners and future STEM technicians. This paper shares the research foundations shaping this approach and the methods by which faculty professional development is being provided to develop this important and sensitive instructional capability in participating faculty. The tiered PD model features a scaffolded series of reflective and activity-oriented modules to incrementally enrich the instructional practices and mindset of HSI STEM educators and strengthen their repertoire of strategies for engaging culturally diverse students. Scaffolding that translates culturally responsive theory to practice spans each of the four distinct topic modules in each tier. Each topic module in a tier then scaffolds to a more advanced topic module in the next tier. Tier 1, Bienvenidos, welcomes HSI STEM educators who recognize the need to better serve their Latinx students, and want guidance for small practical activities to try with their students. Tier 2, Transformation through Action, immerses HSI STEM educators in additional activities that bring culturally responsive practices into their technician training while building capacity to collect evidence about impacts and outcomes for students. Tier 3, Engaging Community, strengthens leadership as HSI STEM educators disseminate results from activities completed in Tiers 1 and 2 at conferences that attract technician educators. Sharing the evidence-based practices and their outcomes contributes to achieving broader impacts in the Advanced Technological Education or ATE Community of NSF grantees. Westchester Community College (WCC), the first 2-year HSI in the State University of New York (SUNY) 64 campus system, is piloting the 3-tier PD model using virtual learning methods mastered through previous NSF ATE work and the COVID-19 context. During the pilot, over 20 WCC technician educators in three cohorts will develop leadership skills and practice culturally responsive methods. The pilot will build capacity within WCC STEM technician programs to better support the diversity of students, industry demand for a diverse workforce, and WCC's capacity for future development of technician education programs.

The experiment was conducted in an ICP EFL reading comprehension course, a five credit course, with five hours of instruction per week, over the first semester of 2021-2022 academic year. Forty ICP EFL students of Sciences and Arts College taking EFL reading comprehension course took part in this study, with 20 students in the experimental group and 20 in the control group. The experimental group received a Jigsaw strategy instruction, whereas the control group received a traditional lecturing instruction. The sole instrument used in this study was an identical pre-post EFL reading comprehension test. Both of the experimental and control groups were administered pre and post EFL reading comprehension tests. The pre- and post- scores from the EFL reading comprehension tests were calculated for descriptive statistics and compared using a t Test. The findings of the study indicated that there were statistically significant differences in favor of the effectiveness of using Jigsaw strategy instruction in enhancing ICP EFL students’ reading comprehension skills. The students’ scores in EFL reading comprehension were higher for the post-test than the pre-test after being subject to Jigsaw strategy instruction. Most literature published on using cooperative learning strategies in the Saudi higher education context did not focus on using Jigsaw strategy in teaching EFL reading comprehension for ICP EFL students. To the best of the researcher’s knowledge, this is the first paper to investigate the effectiveness of using Jigsaw strategy in teaching EFL reading comprehension for secondary school leavers without prior experience with cooperative learning strategies like ICP EFL students. In conclusion, EFL reading comprehension instructors are highly recommended to use Jigsaw strategy instruction in EFL reading comprehension courses.",Proceedings of ADVED 2022- 8th International Conference on Advances in Education,2022.0,5,"{'url': 'https://www.ocerints.org/adved22_e-publication/papers/Mustafa Mohammed Sadek Elsayed1.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47696/adved.202216?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47696/adved.202216, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ae1567dcb65109a3c0a9c301750d4c022e3d851a,Physics of Melt Extraction from the Mantle: Speed and Style,"Melt extraction from the partially molten mantle is among the fundamental processes shaping the solid Earth today and over geological time. A diversity of properties and mechanisms contribute to the physics of melt extraction. We review progress of the past ∼25 years of research in this area, with a focus on understanding the speed and style of buoyancy-driven melt extraction. Observations of U-series disequilibria in young lavas and the surge of deglacial volcanism in Iceland suggest this speed is rapid compared to that predicted by the null hypothesis of diffuse porous flow. The discrepancy indicates that the style of extraction is channelized. We discuss how channelization is sensitive to mechanical and thermochemical properties and feedbacks, and to asthenospheric heterogeneity. We review the grain-scale physics that underpins these properties and hence determines the physical behavior at much larger scales. We then discuss how the speed of melt extraction is crucial to predicting the magmatic response to glacial and sea-level variations. Finally, we assess the frontier of current research and identify areas where significant advances are expected over the next 25 years. In particular, we highlight the coupling of melt extraction with more realistic models of mantle thermochemistry and rheological properties. This coupling will be crucial in understanding complex settings such as subduction zones. ▪ Mantle melt extraction shapes Earth today and over geological time. ▪ Observations, lab experiments, and theory indicate that melt ascends through the mantle at speeds ∼30 m/year by reactively channelized porous flow. ▪ Variations in sea level and glacial ice loading can cause significant changes in melt supply to submarine and subaerial volcanoes. ▪ Fluid-driven fracture is important in the lithosphere and, perhaps, in the mantle wedge of subduction zones, but remains a challenge to model.

a0942d10133d2a02b4d7e288daadd953ce1ff5e5,Digitalization: Implementation in the tourism business of Ukraine,"Global digitalization has led to the formation of a new contour of the economic environment in tourism due to the inevitable and pervasive transformation of socio-economic systems. All this is happening against the background of the synergy of digital and service economies. Therefore, the study analyzes the genesis and world experience of digitalization to determine the areas and advantages of using digital technologies in the tourism business of Ukraine. Systematization, generalization, and surveying were used. Since the main players of the tourism business are tour operators and hotels, and digital technologies are used by entities located in big cities, a survey was conducted among 57 managers of leading tour operators and hotels in Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, and Odesa. The survey was conducted in July 2020–2021 and concerned digital technologies in the business processes. The results showed a dynamic increase in digital technologies, in particular, by an average of 72.2% per year, which reflects their efficiency and dynamics. The leading digital technologies include contactless payments, chatbots, mobile applications, mobile registration, and VR technologies. The data on their 34.6% use as sources of information search, 78.7% as travel planning and organization instruments, and 59.5% as destination orientation instruments are evidence of the large-scale use of digital technologies by foreign tourists. The essence of marketing, economic, innovation, environmental, service, and configuration priorities of digitalization as interdependent drivers for the initiation of the innovation process in tourism has been determined considering the uneven development and fluctuating dynamics of digital technologies.

Exploring the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the first SARS-CoV-1 epidemic in 2003 may inform us of the long-term effects of the actual pandemic, as well as putative influencing factors such as contact with the virus, time effects, or the importance of some sociodemographic data. This information may help us develop efficient preventive strategies. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of PTSD in HCWs following the SARS-CoV-1 in 2003. PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Psychinfo, and Web of Science were searched until September 2022. Random-effects meta-analyses were stratified by the time of follow-up. We included 14 studies: 4842 HCWs (32.0 years old, 84% women). The overall prevalence of PTSD was 14% (95CI 10 to 17%). The prevalence of PTSD was 16% (8 to 24%) during the epidemic, 19% (16 to 22%) within 6 months after the epidemic, and 8% (4 to 13%) more than one year after the end of the epidemic. The longest follow-up was three years after the epidemic, with 10% of HCWs with PTSD. Nevertheless, the prevalence of PTSD was significantly lower more than one year after the end of the epidemic than the first six months after the epidemic (Coefficient −10.4, 95CI −17.6 to −3.2, p = 0.007). In conclusion, the prevalence of PTSD in HCWs was high during the first epidemic of SARS-CoV in 2003 and remained high in the long term.

92dccaa22cc93a730ab5c8ac905a18aaf0fd277e,Role of periostin in evaluating the responsiveness of allergic patients to allergen-specific immunotherapy,"Objectives: Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) has been considered the most effective treatment for IgE mediated allergies, especially respiratory allergies. Several biomarkers have been developed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of AIT, yet none of them have been thoroughly validated. So our objective here is to investigate the usefulness of periostin as a biomaker for monitoring the efficacy of allergen immunotherapy.
Materials and methods: This study included 46 healthy non-atopic volunteers and 46 patients with allergic rhinitis (AR). They were sensitized only to date palm pollen. The participants were tested by skin prick test and total serum IgE levels were measured. Serum samples were collected from healthy subjects and allergic patients before and after the one-year AIT. Serum levels of periostin, eotaxin, and sIL-2R were estimated by ELISA. Symptom scores in the allergic patients were also evaluated before and after completing one year AIT.
Results: There is a significant increase in serum levels of IgE, periostin, sIL-2R, and eotaxin in allergic patients as compared to healthy controls. Symptom scores, sIL-2R and serum periostin levels were significantly decreased after one-year AIT in AR patients.

9c29c9096def7cf58658ef37f9bc69a4808c843b,Enabling Published Taxonomic Data to be used to Address the Biodiversity Crisis: Biodiversity Literature Repository and TreatmentBank,"To understand the loss of species, a benchmark is needed, e.g. the status of biodiversity in 1992 when the Convention on Biological Diversity recognized biodiversity crisis to compare to its status in the successive year. Though we are far from knowning how many species there are on planet Earth, we keep track of their descriptions and number through the information kept in our libraries. Each species discovered is represented therein by at least one taxononic treatment. The library includes an estimated 500 million pages and is updated daily with an estimated 17–18,000 new species annually and over 100,000 treatments augmenting the knowledge of existing species.
 In reality, we do not know how many species exist. We know that the catalogue of life is incomplete and basic knowlege of known species is often lacking and not even updated regularly. On the other hand, the scientific standard to cite previous works and facts is at the same time an ideal prerequisit to build a knowledge graph in the era of digital knowledge.
 TreatmentBank (TB) and the Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR), two European Research Infrastructures, provide a service to convert unstructured biodiversity data from scholarly publications into semantically enhanced, digital accessible knowledge (Fawcett et al. 2022) making it findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR, Wilkinson et al. 2016) and providing long term access in collaboration with Zenodo. Data sources are either legacy publications or active journals using an XML workflow such as Zookeys or the Biodiversity Data Journal, published by the pioneer of taxonomically enhanced Taxpub XML publishing, Pensoft. As part of the Horizon 2020-funded project Biodiversity Community Integrated Knowledge Library (BiCIKL), bidirectional linking of taxonomic names with the Catalogue of Life, DNA-sequences with the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and material citations with their respective natural history collection or their depositions in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is targeted. As input to allow queries including text and data mining for traits and biotic interactions, the treatments are uploaded to the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) Library Service (SIBiLS) using TaxPub and schema based on Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) widely used in life science publishing and PubMed Central, allowing the use of the advanced text and data mining tools in the life science community. Another research infrastructure that ensures an RDF representation and conversion into Linked Open Data (LOD) is OpenBiodiv allowing users to explore DAK as part of growing linked open biodiverstiy and related data. All the data fit for GBIF use is reused by GBIF representing close to 60% of all published data sets, which makes TreatmentBank and BLR, for example, a sole provider of data for approximately 90,000 species not recorded in GBIF by other publishers.
 The long-term strategy is to build up the momentum to be an infrastructure relevant for global biodiversity conservation and research. Long-term support will be achieved by negotiations with respective agencies and publishers, and through building up a global user community using the biodiversity digital acccessible knowledge.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://biss.pensoft.net/article/91167/download/pdf/', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.6.91167?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.6.91167, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The objective of the REU Site is to introduce undergraduate students to the forefront of sustainable manufacturing research and to provide participants with the skills and pathways to pursue advanced degrees or careers in sustainable manufacturing. The intensive ten-week summer research and professional development experience hosts ten students per summer and addresses National Science Foundation priority areas such as advanced manufacturing and sustainability. Undergraduate research projects in the REU site address manufacturing process, manufacturing system, and fundamental sustainable manufacturing principles within continuous (e.g. chemical manufacturing) and discrete (e.g. automotive manufacturing) manufacturing systems. Projects are further associated with topics that cross cut the aforementioned thrust areas such as, emerging and environmentally benign materials manufacturing, sustainable process design and control, and life-cycle engineering and value recovery. Traditionally, this REU Site hosts in-person undergraduate researchers to undertake their research projects in a faculty mentor laboratory during the program. However, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated that the REU Site program be held virtually during the summer of 2021. This poster and summary paper detail the steps taken to transition REU Site program activities to a virtual environment and post-program evaluation results of participant experiences. Evaluation results of the virtual program are compared to evaluation results of prior in-person Summer Academy in Sustainable Manufacturing programs. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/41961.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41961?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41961, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4add0d8e0b66500d5daa76e75ff3a87d65e1964e,COVID-19 and U.S. Higher Education: The Realities of Undergraduate International STEM Students’ Experiences,"Higher Education is the fifth largest service export sector in the United States, with international students contributing $17.7 billion to the U.S. economy each year. There is a plethora of reasons why students migrate to the U.S. to further their education, including but not limited to: (1) increasing their chances for long-term success and increasing self-efficacy;(2) supporting their family through educational advancement;and (3) gaining access to high quality education. Prior research highlights how international students face challenges linked to federal restrictions and policies that potentially hinder their academic success, all of which were heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information such as this raises concern around the current state of undergraduate international STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) students in the U.S. and access to resources (i.e. scholarships, fellowships, internships, full-time jobs, etc.), especially compared to their domestic counterparts. This insight is particularly true for individuals seeking to obtain a degree within STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as the U.S. serves as an incubator for STEM talent due to the abundance of workforce opportunities present. Therefore, it is important to explore the experiences of undergraduate international STEM students pursuing degrees in the U.S., especially as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a lingering effect within higher education. Our target population has an influential impact on the nation's economy, particularly H1-B visa sponsored jobs at top companies within the technology sector driving a large portion of our growth within the STEM workforce. This work in progress focused on qualitative analysis centered on the experience of undergraduate international STEM students. This study includes a literature review that highlights the latest findings around our target populations' experiences during the pandemic. Following that, the methods highlight our proposal to conduct a qualitative analysis including interviews with current students. The methods section closes with a draft of the interview questions which center around their experiences, barriers and challenges they face (past and present) related to the pandemic and information related to access to resources. Lastly, an overview of the proposed impact, implications of this study once complete and overarching conclusions. The goal is to get feedback from the broader ASEE community, finalized the interview protocol, conduct the interviews, analyze, and share results and use the overall findings to propose new directions and future work for the broader community. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/41311.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41311?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41311, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6822970145d487336d5c899dfa3d8251eb6d811c,A STEP CLOSER TO UNDERSTANDING IMPLEMENTATION OF BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL OPERATIONS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW,"The development of business intelligence was marked by several key moments, in particular the development of the Internet and new technologies. The wide distribution of technology and the easier possibility to use it led to the finding of a solution for the tools used by organizations to be a good ratio of quality and invested financial resources, and the increase in digitalization give the opportunity for organization's business intelligence to involve more stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to identify the prerequisites, importance and value of implementing business intelligence in the organizational operations. The analyzed sample is limited to the period from year 2020, given that this period noted the biggest changes in terms of technologies, and therefore transitions in the business of organizations. Based on a systematic literature review on two major scientific databases Web of Science and Scopus, there was found 2051 articles that were initially narrowed down to 65 papers connected to business intelligence directly and finally, to a total number of 10 relevant articles through a methodical approach, and which are connected to the topic of business intelligence in organizational context. Selected papers were analyzed using desk-based research method. This result represents a paper compilation of research results as cooperation of authors, achieved through the student-mentor relationship during the preparation of postgraduate specialist thesis. After conducting the research using text analysis technique, two main groups were determined based on subject of research: papers focused on organizational prerequisites and importance for the successful implementation of BI in the organization's operations and papers focused on the value of implementing BI in the organization's operations. From the analyzed papers, the conclusion is that a trend of studying business intelligence in organizations is visible, and it ranged from the study of organizational prerequisites for the successful implementation of BI during 2020 and the beginning of 2021 and moved towards the analysis of the value that BI has for organizations, mainly in 2021 and 2022.",Proceedings of the International Conferences on Applied Computing 2022 and WWW/Internet 2022,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'http://www.iadisportal.org/components/com_booklibrary/ebooks/202208L020.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33965/ac_icwi2022_202208l020?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33965/ac_icwi2022_202208l020, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This also affected the Malaysian economy where many businesses have halted their operation due to the outbreak as well as movement restriction order (MCO) issued by the government. Nevertheless, the condition in Malaysia is seemingly improved since the vaccination programme set by the government has reached a 78.9% vaccination rate of the total population by the first quarter of the year 2022. Currently, the Malaysian government has now in the transition from the pandemic phase to endemic phase and relaxed the imposition of restrictions that were previously enforced. This allows business operation to regain their grip in the post COVID-19 era. Despite the fragility of the supply chain particularly within the halal ecosystem, a vital aspect that is almost neglected is the encroaching food crime incidents, and the food defence approach which encompasses the protection of food supply chain against intentional contamination is still on high alert. The incidence of meat cartel in late 2020 has warned that food crime is not seizing nor hindered its operation. Therefore, a robust approach needs to be addressed to defend the food supply chain, and more importantly the halal ecosystem. Therefore, this study is carried out to examine the future direction of food defence in the post COVID-19 era in Malaysia. This study utilizes library research to collect the data by using online databases such as Google Scholar, Emerald, Science Direct and SCOPUS. This study also presents strategies for reinforcing the integrity of the food supply chain against the threat of intentional contamination from the perspective of the halal ecosystem.",Journal of contemporary Islamic studies,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.24191/jcis.v8i3.4', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.24191/jcis.v8i3.4?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.24191/jcis.v8i3.4, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Inclusion criteriaconstitute of couples having a married life of a year with at least an active service of one year. Both the partnerswere assessed on work family enrichment scale (work to family enrichment and family to work enrichment),work family conflict scale (work to family conflict and family to work conflict) and work family balance scalerespectively.Results: The psychometric properties of all the scales depict normality of curve. Similarly the results coincidewith the proposed hypothesis suggesting spillover of energies from one domain to another and similarly fromone partner to another. Correlational analysis indicates significant relationship with demographic variablessuch as working hours, years of service, monthly income and number of children.Conclusion: The increased female labor force in our society has led to the peripheral penetration of energiesfrom one domain to another across borders. This study was carried out to investigate the positive and negativeconsequences of crossing the domains and ultimately the effect on overall harmony or balance. Thus, resultsyielded that negative transmission of energies across borders negatively affected both psychological health ofindividuals as well as their occupational spheres and vice versa respectively.How to cite this: Arzu M, Hanif R, Shah M, Fiyaz A.

3927ae23bd20620baa7b6a46cb32d9523f78267a,"Cybercrime in the Republic of Serbia: Prevalence, Situation and Perspectives","The year 2022 was marked by anonymous reports of bombings in schools and other important institutions across Serbia, spread via computers. These events have triggered a public debate on whether the authorities responsible for combating cybercrime can adequately respond to such attacks. As the number of internet users increases, so does the number of potential victims of cybercrime and the obligation of states to protect citizens. Recent events have shown the vulnerability of society to high-tech crime and the risks it poses. The paper analyses the normative and institutional framework for combating cybercrime and data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs on cybercrime. The paper aims to suggest possible changes, based on the analysis of existing cybercrime legislation and the analysis of the institutional framework here and in some European countries, to ensure more effective protection against cybercrime. The paper uses both a normative and a comparative method to present the measures taken in other countries. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze the data collected. The conclusion is that despite a good normative framework, the fight against cybercrime is not adequate, mainly because of the far too small number of staff in special departments and sections of the prosecutor's office and the police compared to the number of crimes, which is increasing year by year. The danger is also that many people are not educated about the dangers of using the internet. Therefore, more attention should be paid shortly to educating citizens of all ages about the dangers and the types of cybercrime.",Kultura polisa,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://kpolisa.com/index.php/kp/article/download/1444/1386', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.51738/kpolisa2022.19.4r.82sj?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.51738/kpolisa2022.19.4r.82sj, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4c3d680f2431316ea290de3b6376ed9da6d66c5f,Ten simple rules for principled simulation modelling,"ed counterpart (Fig 2 in [13]). However, it is an updated version of this second map that is given to millions of tourists travelling across London every year. The inclusion of only important information, abstraction, and omission of extraneous geographical detail has made it one of the most famously useful graphics in history. Models of complex systems should be the same—as detailed as needed but no more detailed than that. So, if you shouldn’t model the system you know in complete detail, what should you model instead? This depends to a great extent on the type of model that you have decided to make (Rule 1). Assuming that some mechanistic insight is the aim, based on knowledge of the system and precise formulation of the research question, a good strategy is to identify putative interactions or mechanisms that could underlie the behaviour or phenomenon under investigation and model those mechanisms. In other words, it is sensible to propose an engine that could be driving the phenomenon of interest and then make characterising and investigating that engine the central focus of the model. Anything in the system irrelevant to that engine is irrelevant to the model. Part of the art of modelling is identifying putative mechanisms and ensuring that the logical thread between mechanism and behaviour is unbroken. Rule 3: Be rigorous, and allow the time to be rigorous Perhaps this is an obvious rule—cience and rigour usually go hand in hand. Successful modelling requires considerable attention to mathematical and computational detail. It is vital that all concepts and all code used in a simulation model are clear to the author and rigorously tested—from their construction to their downstream implications (see Rule 6). Using convenient mathematical or statistical concepts with little or no knowledge about their inner workings will likely lead to their misuse and maybe to serious fundamental errors. Similarly, it can be dangerous to use, for example, software packages or useful-looking chunks of code as untested black boxes (but see Rule 6). The assumptions of the methods implemented in the code, and the implementation itself, must be clear and consistent with the assumptions and aims of your model. Alongside the mathematical and technical details of each part of the model, careful consideration should be given to the order in which these parts or processes are executed and what effect that ordering (or scheduling) has on the output. All of this is to say that modelling decisions need careful thought and, as with empirical data analysis, designing a model that describes your system in adequate (but not excessive) detail, and deriving robust inferences from it, can take significant time. This is time which needs to be budgeted for in any simulation modelling project from the outset. Rule 4: Have a plan for analysis The aim of this rule is to help you to avoid a surprisingly common and deeply frustrating situation: creating a monster simulation with so many moving parts that it just can’t be analysed meaningfully—a situation where you could say to yourself something like “I’ve finished coding this simulation, but how on earth can I analyse so many interactions and so many outputs?” Reaching this point probably means that something has gone wrong in the implementation of Rules 1 or 2—or that the model has been coded without a good plan for its analysis. So, perhaps you know the question you want to answer, you know or have guessed the relevant aspects of the system, but you didn’t plan how the model can answer the question. In general, it is important to have an idea of the analysis steps necessary to answer aspects of the central question. These plans are flexible and develop throughout a project, of course, but an initial plan is crucial. Your exact plan for analysis will depend on your aim and the kind of model you have constructed. For example, if you are interested in unravelling mechanistic relationships, you might use simulated data to explore the workings of the model and to analyse exactly how PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY PLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009917 March 31, 2022 3 / 8 different parameters or processes affect the outcome. To do this successfully, the number of parameters and processes should be manageable (see Rule 2), and parameter explorations should be principled (see Rule 8). Or, if you are interested in fitting your model to observed data, you may need to consider exactly how the model output maps to existing and future data and identify appropriate statistical techniques to robustly test between models and estimate parameters. Here, it will be important to be aware of the limitations and assumptions of the statistical techniques in addition to those of the model itself (see Rule 3). Rule 5: Be kind to your future self (and your readers), and minimise opportunities for errors You will need to revisit your code, sometimes many months after the analysis has been done and the paper has been written. This can either be a difficult exercise for your future self or a simple matter of glancing at your structured, documented, and organised code. Of course, it is best to aim for the latter. This means that code needs to be well structured and well commented so that you are able to easily reconstruct what has been done. To this end, this rule advises a number of good coding practices that are particularly important for simulation models, which can become large and unwieldy projects very quickly. All of these practices will benefit the readers of your model as much as they benefit your future self. First, the names of variables, functions, and parameters should be intuitive, consistent, and immediately intelligible. This makes the code more readable and minimises unnecessary comments. Similarly, adopting consistent formatting conventions (such as indentation and other whitespace), much like punctuation in a sentence, improves code readability. Commenting should be done with both your future self and your future readers in mind. For larger-scale multiresearcher and multiyear projects, more detailed documentation should be created and developed in tandem with the code. As a project grows, it becomes difficult to keep track of the interactions and dependencies between the different parts of the code. This complexity can be made more manageable by giving your code a well-defined and modular structure, meaning that sections of code should be divided into logically related units and the interfaces between these units of code should be well defined. Different programming languages offer different tools to achieve this, and the following advice applies equally to all of them. We’ll use the concept of functions as an example because this is the most fundamental and most commonly used. The aim here is to identify units of self-contained logic and create functions that encapsulate this logic. Functions should have a single clear purpose so, if you find you’re writing a function which performs multiple conceptual actions, consider breaking it up into 2 or more functions. Encapsulating logic in this way creates higher-order building blocks that can be reused and avoid code duplication. This reduces the opportunity for errors, not only because there will be less code to begin with, but also because each logical unit can be easily tested individually. In fact, it is good practice to test functions as you write them—this helps to avoid bugs in “low-level” functions that often manifest as difficult to diagnose problems downstream. The ubiquitously useful coding mantra “fail early and fail loudly” posits that it is better to raise an error as soon as it could feasibly be detected. So, for example, it is best to have functions check that their inputs are valid rather than allowing them to blindly compute and pass nonsensical output downstream. Despite taking these steps to manage the complexity of your project, you will write bugs. Everyone does and it is unavoidable. But, if you have written modular, well-structured code, it will be much easier to test the code, find the bugs, and squash them. PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY PLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009917 March 31, 2022 4 / 8 With a similar aim in mind, it is now common practice and explicitly required by some journals that model code is published alongside the paper it generates. This has a number of important benefits. It facilitates open and reproducible science. It also benefits you as a modeller. Bugs and coding issues can be identified by reviewers and readers who go through the code. This can be an important source of error checking. Finally, but equally importantly, you will need to test that the (now hopefully bug free) code actually does what it is supposed to in terms of the model’s dynamics. The full code, and each constituent part, should be put through its paces using simple test cases for which you have either good intuitions or solid analytical expectations to which the model outcomes should conform. Rule 6: Write practical code Practical code doesn’t have to be perfect, fully optimised, or even beautifully written, but it is fit for purpose, well tested, and clearly documented so that others (and you) can have confidence in it (see Rule 5). Practical coding also means using your coding time efficiently. Investing some time in learning to use the debugging tools available to your programming language will quickly pay for itself in time saved identifying and fixing bugs more quickly. There are a great many well-tested and already optimised scientific libraries/packages, and there is usually nothing to be gained by reimplementing functionality that already exists. Making use of good quality libraries will speed up development and reduce your opportunities to write bugs (see Rule 5), although it is critical to ensure that the methods used are appropriate for your context (see the note abou",PLoS Comput.

Our pilot lesson study on classroom evaluation in primary schools fits into this line of research and explores further aspects of the theory. The project was launched in Hungary, in the academic year of 2021/2022. Our action research was conducted in the fields of sciences, humanities, and physical education in Grades 5–8. We wanted to find out how assessment methods and tools in these areas are adapted to the age group, the situation, and the curriculum. We must highlight that the focus of the project was not on the measurement of the growth of the learners’ learning ability, but rather on the teacher-student-student interactions. During the research, different lessons and lesson segments were visited and video recorded, then discourse analysis (Burgess and Cargill, 2013) – a new approach to content analysis – was applied to investigate the evaluation methods in the lessons. Our main research questions are: (1) What are the consciously used evaluation methods? (2) What is the distribution of the evaluators? (3) Are there subject or science specific tools applied in the evaluation process? (4) How personal, supportive, and tactful is the evaluation? (5) What is the quality and quantity of verbal and non-verbal feedback?

dc5d0a3cface04a2a54a36cd712f46c8800078b1,A scoping review of brief alcohol interventions across young adult subpopulations.,"OBJECTIVE
Brief alcohol interventions (BAIs) have historically centered on young adults attending 4-year predominantly white institutions. The purpose of this scoping review is to determine BAIs evaluated among young adults with one or more marginalized/understudied racial, ethnic, sexual, gender, and military/Veteran identities and/or who are embedded in an understudied context based on houselessness, attending a 2-year institution, or not attending college. A secondary objective is to explore definitions of the constructs young adult and brief to inform subsequent systematic reviews.


METHOD
Sources had to be published in English between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2019 and report the evaluation of an intervention ≤ 5 hr long, delivered over ≤ 4 weeks, among participants aged 18-30 years (or 16-30 in college contexts) within a specified marginalized/understudied subpopulation/context wherein alcohol use and/or consequences were a primary outcome. Systematic searches were conducted in APA PsycNet, the EBSCO Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PubMed, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science. Screening was independently performed by two coders who also extracted data.


RESULTS
Of 4,825 identified records, 158 provided data; 86 described interventions fitting our definition of brief; of these, only 21 met criteria based on our definition of young adult, with nine meeting full inclusion criteria based on young adult subpopulation.


CONCLUSIONS
Findings signify a need for additional research evaluating BAIs among young adult subpopulations and highlight the importance of carefully defining and reporting participant characteristics. Increased attention to sociocultural considerations and strengths relevant to the diverse contexts and intersecting identities of young adults may strengthen extant BAIs and equitably mitigate alcohol-related harm.

a20ca98baa583f6ad225282e1104c24de615e932,First Report of Tobacco Root Rot Caused by Fusarium falciforme in China.,"China is the largest producer of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) in the world with an estimated production of 2.4 million ton per year (Berbeć and Matyka 2020). In June 2021, a root disease was observed on tobacco in three surveyed counties (Xiangcheng, Linying and Jiaxian) in central Henan. Diseased plants exhibited leaf chlorosis and brown to purplish vascular discoloration of the taproot and lateral roots. Approximately 10 to 15% of the plants were symptomatic in the nine fields surveyed, representing 60 ha in total. Root segments (0.5 to 1 cm) from ten diseased plants were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 30 s followed by rinsing with sterile distilled water three times. Thirty air dried root pieces were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25℃ in the dark for 2 days. Typical Fusarium spp. colonies were obtained from all root samples. Ten pure cultures were obtained by single-spore culturing (Yz01 to Yz10). Colonies on PDA showed abundant white to cream aerial mycelia with a yellowish-brown center on the reverse side after 7 days, and an average growth rate of 5 mm/day. From 7-day-old cultures grown on carnation leaf agar (CLA), macroconidia had three to four septa, were falciform, with blunt apical cells and slightly hooked basal cell, and measured 20 to 41×3-6.5 μm (n=50). Spherical conidia clusters were formed at the apex of the conidiophores. Abundant reniform and cylindrical microconidia were one to two-celled, with apexes rounded, measuring 7 to 15×2 to 5 μm (n=50). The roughly spherical chlamydospores were intercalary or terminal, single or in chains, and rough walled. Such characteristics were consistent with the Fuarium solani species complex (FSSC) (Leslie and Summerell 2006). The translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) gene of the ten cultures was amplified with primers EF1/EF2 (O'Donnell et al. 1998), and sequenced. Maximum likelihood analysis was carried out using the EF1-α sequences of the ten cultures (Kumar et al. 2016). The RNA polymerase I largest subunit (RPB1) and second largest subunit (RPB2) genes of the cultures were amplified with primers F5/G2R and RPB2F/R respectively (O'Donnell et al. 1998, 2010), and sequenced. The EF1-α, RPB1 and RPB2 sequences (GenBank accession nos. ON186742.1-ON186751.1, ON241133.1-ON241148.1, ON324054.1-ON324057.1) were 99.4 to 100% identical to the corresponding DNA sequences of Fusarium falciforme based on FUSARIUM-ID BLASTn analysis. Morphological and molecular results confirmed this species as F. falcifome (Díaz-Nájera et al. 2021; Velarde-Félix et al. 2022). Pathogenicity tests were performed in tobacco seedlings grown on autoclaved soil. Healthy six-leaf stage tobacco seedlings (n=30; Zhongyan 100) were inoculated by placing 7-days old wheat seed (15 seeds per plant) infested with the representative culture Yz07 around the root. Thirty seedlings inoculated with sterile wheat seeds served as controls. All the plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 25±0.5℃ and 70% relative humidity. The assay was conducted three times. Typical symptoms of foliage chlorosis and root browning were observed 7 to 14 days after inoculation for all the 90 inoculated seedlings. Fifteen diseased seedlings were randomly selected for tissue isolation, and F. falciforme was reisolated from the 15 seedlings and showed the same morphology and EF1-α gene sequence as the original isolate. Control plants remained asymptomatic and no pathogen was recovered. The results showed that F. falciforme can cause root rot of tobacco. F. falciforme was reported to cause tobacco wilt and root rot in Northwestern Argentina (Berruezo et al. 2018); however, this is the first report of F. falciforme causing root rot of tobacco in China. This species was previously reported in China affecting Weigela florida (Shen et al. 2019) and Dioscorea polystachya (Zhang et al. 2020), showing that F. falciforme has a broad host range in this country. These results may inform control tobacco root rot through improve crop rotations.

If your sweet, little nine-year old came to you and said, “I want to spend my life exploring those big green things in rivers that have all those great teeth” what would you think? Most of us would immediately consider: Therapy! Fast! (This is obviously due to one's spouse's bad genes!) “Sweetheart,” we would ask, “Aren't you interested in those fascinating whales? Maybe our curious monkey-relatives? Wouldn't you like to study the regal great cats? Or, perhaps, the magnificent and ever-beautiful array of birds? How about the noble and determined turtle?” “Nope,” says your future heir, “really think those scaly things with the great chompers are where it's at!” Great, a thousand hours of sensitivity training, making sure they never played with toy guns, decorating their rooms with happy unicorns and smiling butterflies, taking them to see only the animals they could actually pet at the children's zoo, and giving everyone on their baseball team a trophy so they had a positive self-image even if all they could hit with a bat was themselves, and the repository of all your hard work, hopes, and dreams wants to spend their life with some of the scariest denizens that have ever inhabited our world!! Where did we err? What is wrong with the kid? Well, apparently, nothing, as there seem to be lots and lots of now big kids similarly fascinated (and most of them are not in prisons!). A bask (bet you did not know that is what a group of crocodiles is historically called?; JL's relatives in Florida call a group of their alligator cousins a “tsuris” – literally, trouble, in Yiddish) of such folks have come together to share their findings, thoughts, and opinions on crocs of all ilks in this extraordinary Special Issue of The Anatomical Record entitled, “The Age of Crocodilians and Their Kin: Anatomy, Physiology, and Evolution”. The Special Issue is Guest Edited by Professors Casey Holliday of the University of Missouri School of Medicine and Emma R. Schachner of Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (Holliday & Schachner, 2022, this volume.). The Special Issue explores both the anatomy and physiology of living and fossil crocodylomorphs (described below, but basically the group of pseudosuchian archosaurs that are generally included in present-day crocodilians and their extinct relatives; hang-in there, translations to come.) First a nod to our intrepid Guest Editors, Casey and Emma (we have worked too closely and too long for formalities). Our Guest Editors are two energetic stars in the study of functional anatomy of living crocodilians and on the reconstruction of reptilian ancestors in the prehistoric world, often based upon their own findings on living forms. To any who have met them, they are also really interesting people who do interesting things (JL comment: sort of like HFS who studies all sorts of fascinating beasties; no comments on JL, please). First, a few words about the junior member of the team, Emma Schachner. Emma is a product of vertebrate paleontological royalty, having taken her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with Peter Dodson, who is, with only a little hyperbole, a living god in the world of prehistoric beasts (Peter's influence has been ubiquitous; he was, for example, JL's anatomy table-mate, big-sib, and life-line at Yale during what seems like the Late Cretaceous; see Laitman, 2009). Indeed, Co-Guest Editor Holliday was a student of noted paleontologist Larry Witmer who was a student of Peter's student David Weishampel, thus making Casey an academic great-grandchild of Peter's as well (we feel as if we should bow before them!). Emma is an animal person – fascinated both by those that are alive and those she figuratively brings back to life from fossils. For example, she adores and trains dogs, especially her pit bulls Mila and Augustus – who have their own Instagram account, @thevelvetburritos (she is also an afficionado of Middle and Late Republican Roman history, hence the names!) When not with her pooches, she spends most Sundays shooting at United States Practical Shooting Association (USPSA) matches (Do you think someone who lives in Louisiana and studies alligators would join the crochet club on weekends?) Oh, and in her spare time Emma has authored many insightful studies on the anatomy of living and extinct reptilians, including in The Anatomical Record, for example: on insights into the evolution of the respiratory system in nonavian theropods (Schachner, Lyson, & Dodson, 2009); new interpretations of the dinosaurian Received: 12 July 2022 Accepted: 12 July 2022",The Anatomical Record,2022.0,5,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/ar.25046?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.25046, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1f09bc7c86f6fa04f9b2e12246680d7954e9cac8,The Dawn of Plant Molecular Biology: How Three Key Methodologies Paved the Way,"The adoption of Arabidopsis thaliana in the 1980s as a universal plant model finally enabled researchers to adopt and take full advantage of the molecular biology tools and methods developed in the bacterial and animal fields since the early 1970s. It further brought the plant sciences up to speed with other research fields, which had been employing widely accepted model organisms for decades. In parallel with this major development, the concurrent establishment of the plant transformation methodology and the description of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter enabled scientists to create robust transgenic plant lines for the first time, thereby providing a valuable tool for studying gene function. The ability to create transgenic plants launched the plant biotechnology sector, with Monsanto and Plant Genetic Systems developing the first herbicide‐ and pest‐tolerant plants, initiating a revolution in the agricultural industry. Here I review the major developments over a less than 10‐year span and demonstrate how they complemented each other to trigger a revolution in plant molecular biology and launch an era of unprecedented progress for the whole plant field. © 2022 The Authors.

In 2011, Addiction Science & Clinical Practice (ASCP) Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Samet (with the late Editor Emeritus Richard Saitz) took the reins of our journal from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to usher it into a new era as an open-access forum for clinically relevant research and perspectives that contribute to improving the quality of care (prevention and treatment) for people with unhealthy alcohol, tobacco, or other drug use and addictive behaviors across a spectrum of settings. Now, as we begin our 11th year, we can look back at our accomplishments over the last decade: we have published 766 articles (44% from outside the US, 26% from Europe); produced 5 thematic series, 1 special issue, and 10 supplements; and forged lasting partnerships with the International Network on Brief Interventions for Alcohol and Drugs (INEBRIA) and the Addictions Health Services Research (AHSR) Conference. ASCP has been cited 7277 times with a yearly average 12% increase that jumped to 28% in the last year. Notably in 2020, we received a firsttime Journal Impact Factor of 3.088, 7th of 20 addiction journals (it has since climbed to 3.544 in 2021). We are proud of these accomplishments and grateful to our team of outstanding associate editors, our editorial board and managing editor, our contributors, and all of you who contribute your time to review articles for us. The work of our ASCP community has never been more relevant. Though addiction is a consistent and ubiquitous threat to public health across cultures and societies globally, roughly over the same period as our journal was gaining momentum, substance use reached an all-time high. The US opioid overdose crisis hit peak levels of deaths and increasingly became characterized by polysubstance use with particularly large increases in methamphetamine use among people who use opioids [1]. Overdose deaths from cocaine and methamphetamine increased 3and 13-fold, respectively [2, 3]. Unhealthy alcohol use increased substantially, particularly in women; alcohol-related deaths doubled between 1999 and 2017 and served as a major contributor to the decline in overall US life expectancy observed between 2015 and 2017 [4]. Though tobacco use has declined overall worldwide, use has increased among men; 45% of adults in South East Asia use tobacco [5], and vaping among youth increased ~ 75% between 2017 and 2018 with greater increases expected annually [6]. Finally, both medical and recreational cannabis use have become increasingly legal and accessible, creating a need for studies about its epidemiology and treatment, particularly its longitudinal health impacts [7]. This time was also marked by new funding mechanisms and multiple innovative and rigorous efforts to implement evidence-based care for substance use in medical settings [8–11] and innovative clinical trials [12–14] the results of which have informed clinical guidelines [15] and ongoing conversations about best practices [16–18]. Despite these innovations, the majority of persons with unhealthy substance use, substance use disorders, and/or other addictive disorders do not receive evidence-based care [19, 20].

7bf87a9d82a00370fdcdd08b5ce9ccf2e9f52b12,Social Media Use for Research Participant Recruitment: Integrative Literature Review,"Background Social media tools have provided health researchers with the opportunity to engage with communities and groups in a nonconventional manner to recruit participants for health research. Using social media to advertise research opportunities and recruit participants facilitates accessibility to participants from broad geographical areas and diverse populations. However, little guidance is provided by ethics review boards for researchers to effectively use this recruitment method in their research. Objective This study sought to explore the literature on the use of social media for participant recruitment for research studies and identify the best practices for recruiting participants using this method. Methods An integrative review approach was used to synthesize the literature. A total of 5 health sciences databases, namely, EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid and EBSCOhost), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus (Elsevier), and CINAHL Plus with Full Text (EBSCOhost), were searched using predefined keywords and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The initial search was conducted in October 2020 and was updated in February 2022. Descriptive and content analyses were applied to synthesize the results, and the findings are presented in a narrative and tabular format. Results A total of 96 records were included in this review, 83 (86%) from the initial search and 13 (14%) from the updated search. The publication year ranged between 2011 and 2022, with most publications (63/96, 66%) being from the United States. Regarding recruitment strategy, 45% (43/96) of the studies exclusively used social media, whereas 51% (49/96) used social media in conjunction with other strategies. The remaining 4% (4/96) provided guidelines and recommendations for social media recruitment. Notably, 38% (36/96) of these studies involved hard-to-reach populations. The findings also revealed that the use of social media is a cost-effective and efficient strategy for recruiting research participants. Despite the expanded use across different populations, there is limited participation of older adults in social media recruitment. Conclusions This review provides important insights into the current use of social media for health research participant recruitment. Ethics boards and research support services in academic institutions are encouraged to explicitly provide researchers with guidelines on the use of social media for health research participant recruitment. A preliminary guideline prepared based on the findings of this review is proposed to spark further development in this area.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2022.0,82,"{'url': 'https://www.jmir.org/2022/8/e38015/PDF', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9389385, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4ab3609e94289c4175ac9ef0f20f024f3142a0c9,Response to ‘A well‐established fact: Rapid mineralization of organic inputs is an important factor for soil carbon sequestration’ by Angers et al.,"In a recent opinion piece, Angers et al. (2022) comment on our earlier article about carbon sequestration in soils (Berthelin et al., 2022), and opine that in that article we present ‘some interesting considerations, at least one of which is already well-known to soil scientists working on soil organic carbon (SOC), that is, a large portion (80%– 90%) of fresh carbon inputs to soil is subject to rapid mineralisation’. They argue that the ‘short-term mineralisation kinetics of organic inputs are well-known and accounted for in soil organic matter models’, and they object to what they portray as our perspective that longterm predictions of soil carbon sequestration based on these models overlook short-term mineralisation. Angers et al. (2022) evidently miss the main point made by Berthelin et al. (2022). Our argument is not that rapid mineralisation of organic inputs is overlooked per se, but that its significance in limiting SOC sequestration appears to be frequently overlooked in considerations of practices to sequester SOC in the context of mitigating climate change. In Berthelin et al. (2022) we take great care to explain that a significant body of literature has been devoted to the rapid mineralisation of fresh inputs and how the resulting information, by way of first-order kinetic parameters, has been incorporated into computer models that have been used extensively to predict the fate of SOC under different climate scenarios and agricultural practices. A key point we make is that only about 10% of the C added in fresh organic additions becomes stabilised in the long term (say 30 years, as illustrated in figure 1 of Berthelin et al., 2022): Long-term stabilisation of C is a necessary requirement for mitigating climate change. Another way of expressing this is to say that to achieve a desired increase in stable SOC, 10 times this quantity must be added initially. This raises a major challenge concerning the sources of such large additional C inputs, as discussed in our paper and also by Janzen et al. (2022). Angers et al. (2022) cite many examples of changes in agronomic practice that lead to increased SOC. These are entirely valid, beneficial and non-controversial. An excellent example they cite is the major change in cropping practice in the semi-arid Canadian Prairies to eliminate summer fallow and move to no-till instead of conventional ploughing. There is no question that where such changes are possible they should be encouraged using whatever policy, financial or advisory mechanisms available. The question in the context of slowing climate change is the scale of C sequestration that is achievable in practice. Angers et al. (2022) also cite an example of SOC increases achieved in China since 1980 (Zhao et al., 2018). Unfortunately, this is a less convincing example of SOC sequestration contributing to climate change mitigation. At least part of the recorded SOC increases over a 30-year period resulted from increased crop yields caused by greatly increased applications of nitrogen fertiliser and the cited study takes no account of additional greenhouse gas emissions associated with this. Offsetting the beneficial impacts for climate of increased SOC sequestration by other greenhouse gas emissions was discussed by Gao et al. (2018) in the context of Chinese agriculture. A reminder that SOC sequestration must not be viewed in isolation. To conclude, we are in full agreement with Angers et al. (2022) that it is vital to increase organic matter in soils to the extent possible to enable them to withstand the effects of climate change and facilitate the range of functions required by humanity (Baveye et al., 2020, 2022; Vogel et al., 2022). Where we disagree is the extent to which increasing SOC can contribute to climate change mitigation through the build-up of stable forms of C for the reasons we have discussed. Further interdisciplinary research is urgently needed to better understand the microscale processes involved in organic matter mineralisation and stabilisation and eventually make sound, scientifically-based recommendations to policymakers. In the context of climate change mitigation, it is worth recalling words by Bossio et al. (2020). They commented that SOC sequestration is not an alternative to emission reductions in other sectors, but an additional opportunity, and one that ‘should be neither dismissed nor exaggerated’.

b6f58bd3bd5a93d16d0435904c27ca059cde4055,Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) feeding incidence and survival on Bt maize in relation to maize in the landscape,"Abstract Background Characterizing Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) damage to maize (Zea mays L.) in relation to the spatiotemporal composition of Bt crops is essential to understand how landscape composition affects H. zea abundance. To examine this relationship, paired Bt (expressing Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2) and non‐Bt maize plots were sampled across North and South Carolina during 2017–2019. Kernel damage and larval exit holes were measured following larval development. To understand how maize abundance surrounding sample sites related to feeding damage and larval development, we quantified maize abundance in a 1 km buffer surrounding the sample site and examined the relationship between local maize abundance and kernel damage and larval exit holes. Results Across the years and locations, damage in Bt maize was widespread but significantly lower than in non‐Bt maize, indicating that despite the widespread occurrence of resistance to Cry toxins in maize, Bt maize still provides a measurable reduction in damage. There were negative relationships between kernel injury and ears with larval exit holes in both Bt and non‐Bt maize and the proportion of maize in the landscape during the current year. Conclusion Despite the widespread occurrence of resistance to Cry toxins in maize, this resistance is incomplete, and on average Bt maize continues to provide a measurable reduction in damage. We interpret the negative relationship between abundance of maize within 1 km of the sample location and maize infestation levels, as measured by kernel damage and larval exit holes, to reflect dispersion of the ovipositing moth population over available maize within the local landscape. © 2022 The Authors.

Although the applicability of robotic rehabilitation is a topic with considerable practical significance because it has produced noticeably higher improvements in motor function than regular (physical and occupational) therapy and exempted the therapists, most of the existing bibliometric papers were not focused on stroke survivors. Additionally, a modular system is designed by joining several medical end-effector devices to a single limb segment, which addresses the issue of potentially dangerous pathological compensatory motions. Searching the Web of Science database, 31,930 papers were identified, and using the VOSviewer software and science mapping technology, data were extracted on the most prolific countries, the connections between them, the most valuable journals according to certain factors, their average year of publication, the most influential papers, and the most relevant topical issues (bubble map of term occurrence). The most prolific country in the analyzed field and over the entire period evaluated (1975–2022) is the United States, and the most prolific journal is Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair, observing a marked increase in the three periods of scientific interest for this field.

9659c65587e0dd8e53bd34b5a6e3fe4b718dffc7,"A longitudinal mediational investigation of risk pathways among cannabis use, interpersonal trauma exposure, and trauma-related distress.","OBJECTIVE
College students are at high risk for cannabis use, interpersonal trauma (IPT) exposure, and trauma-related distress (TRD). Two phenotypic etiologic models posited to explain associations between cannabis use and trauma-related phenotypes are the self-medication (trauma/TRD → cannabis use) and high-risk (cannabis use → trauma/TRD) hypotheses. The primary objective of the present study was to investigate direct and indirect associations among cannabis use, IPT exposure, and TRD above and beyond established covariates.


METHOD
The current study used data from the first assessment (i.e., baseline survey at Year 1 Fall) and two follow-up assessments (i.e., Year 1 Spring and Year 2 Spring) from an ongoing longitudinal study on college behavioral health. Participants were 4 cohorts of college students (n = 9,889) who completed measures of demographics, substance use, IPT, and TRD. Indirect effects of IPT on cannabis through TRD (i.e., self-medication) and cannabis on TRD through IPT (i.e., high-risk), including tests of covariate effects (e.g., gender, age, race, cohort, alcohol, nicotine), were simultaneously estimated using a longitudinal mediation modeling framework.


RESULTS
Results suggest that more IPT exposure increases risk for TRD and subsequent nonexperimental (use 6+ times) cannabis use, and that experimental (use 1-5 times) and nonexperimental cannabis use increases risk for IPT exposure and subsequent TRD.


CONCLUSIONS
Both the self-medication and high-risk hypotheses were supported. Findings support a bidirectional causal relationship between cannabis use and trauma-related phenotypes. Additionally, results highlight areas for colleges to intervene among students to help reduce cannabis use and create a safer environment.

d91bd9e6db8178ad993ceef43c1ce38bb58d9cac,Uses of Different Machine Learning Algorithms for Diagnosis of Dental Caries,"Background Dental caries is one of the major oral health problems and is increasing rapidly among people of every age (children, men, and women). Deep learning, a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is a growing field nowadays and is commonly used in dentistry. AI is a reliable platform to make dental care better, smoother, and time-saving for professionals. AI helps the dentistry professionals to fulfil demands of patients and to ensure quality treatment and better oral health care. AI can also help in predicting failures of clinical cases and gives reliable solutions. In this way, it helps in reducing morbidity ratio and increasing quality treatment of dental problem in population. Objectives The main objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of studies concerning the association between dental caries and machine learning. The objective of this study is to design according to the PICO criteria. Materials and Methods A systematic search for randomized trials was conducted under the guidelines of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). In this study, e-search was conducted from four databases including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, and it involved studies from year 2008 to 2022. Result This study fetched a total of 133 articles, from which twelve are selected for this systematic review. We analyzed different types of machine learning algorithms from which deep learning is widely used with dental caries images dataset. Neural Network Backpropagation algorithm, one of the deep learning algorithms, gives a maximum accuracy of 99%. Conclusion In this systematic review, we concluded how deep learning has been applied to the images of teeth to diagnose the detection of dental caries with its three types (proximal, occlusal, and root caries). Considering our findings, further well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate the diagnosis of further types of dental caries that are based on progression (chronic, acute, and arrested), which tells us about the severity of caries, virginity of lesion, and extent of caries. Apart from dental caries, AI in the future will emerge as supreme technology to detect other diseases of oral region combinedly and comprehensively because AI will easily analyze big datasets that contain multiple records.",Journal of Healthcare Engineering,2022.0,37,"{'url': 'https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jhe/2022/5032435.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8989613, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Banks or financial institutions. DeFi is built on Blockchain technology that stores DeFi transaction data or “decentralized finance” and aims to create financial services that are open to all. The DeFi platform can operate by itself without any control and is called “Smart Contract.” It is widely used as an infrastructure for developers. Decentralized Applications (Dapps), which is the purpose of this research aims to study the operating system and capabilities of each platform. The creators of Etheruem, in addition to Vitalik Bulletin, are also other founding members who co-founded Ethereum, some of them have branched out to create their own networks, such as Gavin Woord who spun off to create Polkadot (DOT), or Charles Hoskinson who spun out to create Cardano (ADA), and Fabian Vogelsteller who spun out to create Lukso (LYXe), etc. All three networks are proof-of-stake blockchains, unlike Ethereum, which is Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake system which can do higher processing speed Proof-of-Work. It saves a lot of energy, and instead of having each computer compete with each other to solve the equation in exchange for permission to verify transactions, Proof-of-Stake. The reviewers are randomly selected by the system with higher processing speeds than Ethereum. These networks are called third-generation Blockchain Ethereum. It is about to have a major update called “Ethereum 2.0” that will change the network to Proof-of-Stake including modifying various systems to make it easier to use for the general public.

29c4817fb27a735160b4a0295dcf05b1dd7833c1,Digital and Analog Spaces: the Geography of Art VIII International Conference,"The VIII International Scientific Conference Geography of Art was held in May 2022. This is a new step in a long-term project devoted to the issues of “mastering” geographical space through art, including the semiotics of spaces created by artists, sculptors, and architects. Among other aspects, the conference examined how art creates geographical images and fantasy worlds, which always have a trace of the real world’s spatial regularities. Since 1994, the project has existed in the form of collections of scientific articles, and since 2009—in the form of conferences as well. The project was conceived by Russian geographer Yury Vedenin, and later Olga Lavrenova, philosopher and culturologist, picked up the initiative. In recent years, the conference has been organized by the Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Arts, GIRT Film and Television School, and the Russian State University for the Humanities. In 2022, the Faculty of Geography and Geoinformation Technology of the HSE University joined the team of organizers. A separate section of the conference was dedicated to media, photo and cinema. There were reports on the historical and cultural aspects of creating virtual spaces, and on the images of the territories created by screen arts. Following the tradition, conferees considered the role of territorial factors in the formation of art schools and individual art works. This year, the discussions focused on digital media. An important place was given to photography as a tool for shaping geographical images and fixing them in time. The combination of a digital replica of the world with new landscape art creates a new augmented reality as a work of art. The geography of fashion and musical culture are also expressed in digital reality. A separate subject is the structures of chaos and order in cinema—the very concepts of space, which are yet another traditional talking point at the conference. These topics are in the mainstream of the discussion of semiotics of space created through art, as well as the geographical aspects of art development, including digital art.",The Art and Science of Television,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://tv-science.online/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/O.A.-Lavrenova.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30628/1994-9529-2022-18.4-173-185?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30628/1994-9529-2022-18.4-173-185, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6107c06d96abdbd68f5c99db276616fabfb5dc08,Preliminary Findings of Usability Studies on an Ontology-Aware Taxon-by-Character Matrix Editor,"Taxonomic treatments start with the creation of taxon-by-character matrices. Systematics authors recognized data ambiguity issues in published phenotypic characters and are willing to adopt an ontology-aware authoring tool (Cui et al. 2022). To promote interoperable and reusable taxonomic treatments, we have developed two research prototypes:
 
 
 
 a web-based application, Character Recorder (http://chrecorder.lusites.xyz/login), to faciliate the use and addition of ontology terms by Carex systematist authors while building their matrices, and
 
 
 a mobile application, Conflict Resolver (Android, https://tinyurl.com/5cfatrz8), to identify potential conflicts among the terms added by the authors and facilitate the resolution of the conflicts. We have completed two usability studies on Character Recorder.
 
 
 
 a web-based application, Character Recorder (http://chrecorder.lusites.xyz/login), to faciliate the use and addition of ontology terms by Carex systematist authors while building their matrices, and
 a mobile application, Conflict Resolver (Android, https://tinyurl.com/5cfatrz8), to identify potential conflicts among the terms added by the authors and facilitate the resolution of the conflicts. We have completed two usability studies on Character Recorder.
 In the one-hour Student Usabiilty Study, 16 third-year biology students with a general introduction to Carex used Character Recorder and Excel to record a set of 11 given characters for two samples (shape of sheath summits = U-shaped/U shaped). In the three-day Expert Usability Study, 7 established Carex systematists and 1 graduate student with expert-level knowledge used Character Recorder to record characters for 1 sample each of Carex canesens and Carex rostrata as they would in their professional life, using real mounted specimens, microscope, reticles, and rulers. Experts activities were not timed but they spent roughly 1.5 days on recording the characters and the rest of time discussing features and improvements. 
 Features of Character Recorder have been reported in 2021 TDWG meeting and we included here only a few figures to highlight its interoperability and reusability features at the time of the usability studies (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 3). The Carex Ontology accompanying Character Recorder was created by extracting terms from Carex treatments of Flora of China and Flora of North America using Explorer of Taxon Concept (Cui et al. 2016) with subsequent manual edits. The design principle of Character Recorder is to encourage standardization and also leave the authors the freedom to do their work.
 While it took students an average of 6 minutes to recover all the given characters using Microsoft® Excel®, as opposed to 11 minutes using Character Recorder, the total number of unique meaning-bearing words used in their characters was 116 with Excel versus 30 with Character Recorder, showing the power of the latter in reducing synonyms and spelling variations. All students reported that they learned to use Character Recorder quickly and some even thought their use was as fast or faster than using Excel. All preferred Character Recorder to Excel for teaching students to record character data. Nearly all of the students found Character Recorder was more useful for recording clear and consistent data and all students agreed that participating in this study raised their awareness of data variation issues. 
 The expert group consisted of 3, 2, 1, 3 experts in age ranges 20-49, 50-59, 60-69, and >69, respectively. They each recorded over 100 characters for two or more samples. Detailed analysis of their characters is pending, but we have noticed color characters have more variations than other characters (Fig. 4). All experts reported that they learned to use Character Recorder quickly, and 6 out of 8 believed they would not need a tutorial the next time they used it. One out of 8 experts somewhat disliked the feature of reusing others' values (""Use This"" in Fig. 2) as it may undermine the objectivity and independence of an author. All experts used Recommended Set of Characters and they liked the term suggestion and illustration features shown in Figs 2, 3. All experts would recommend that their colleagues try Character Recorder and recommended that it be further developed and integrated into every taxonomist's toolbox. 
 Student and expert responses to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX, Hart and Staveland 1988) are summarized in Fig. 5, which suggests that, while Character Recorder may incur in a slightly higher cost, the performance it supports outweighs its cost, especially for students. 
 Every piece of the software prototypes and associated resources are open for anyone to access or further develop.

8c787697becc7e4b808262b807a1dfbf6b3125e4,"Book Review: Together in Music. Coordination, Expression, Participation by Timmers, R., Bailes, F. & Daffern, H.","While music performance studies have tended to focus on solo performance or on performers as individuals (see for example how even the recent Oxford Handbook of Music Performance (2022) has only two chapters specifically dedicated to the case of ensemble performance over the course of its two volumes), there has been more and more interest in the past few years in studying collective musical performances and music ensembles of all sizes. Part of this interest comes ‘from within’ so to speak – from musicologists and music psychologists embracing a social turn and looking to understand in more depth the processes and mechanisms underlying joint musical activities (from rehearsal to actual performance) over a large range of artistic practices (see for example Clarke & Doffman, 2017). But this surge in interest is also due to a growing tendency within the social and cognitive sciences more broadly to treat musical ensembles as a paradigmatic group activity that allows for the systematic exploration of general issues related to joint action, group ontology, distributed creativity, and social cognition (Aucouturier & Canonne, 2017; D’Ausilio et al., 2015; Michael, 2017). Packing 36 chapters in a little less than 300 pages, the edited collection Together in Music. Coordination, Expression, Participation ties together these two trends and offers an overview of the diversity of research currently done within this exciting field. The book follows a threepart structure, with the first part tackling the ‘meso’ level – that is, group interaction and communication during rehearsals, group organization, group identity, etc. – the second part, the ‘micro’ level – that is, decision-making during group performance, synchronization, fine-grained interactions, ancillary gestures, etc. – and the third part, the ‘macro’ level – that is, the long-term effects of collective musical practices on wellness, empowerment and development, or the embedment of collective musical practices within broader communities. Within each part, review papers presenting tools, theoretical frameworks, and typologies alternate with more focused papers reporting on specific case studies. To say that I was eagerly waiting for a book like this would be an understatement. Having dedicated a large part of my research time for the past 10 years to exploring group improvisation, I am still fascinated and amazed by how complex joint music-making practices and collective musical behaviors can turn out to be. My expectations were thus high. However, I must confess that I was slightly disappointed by this collection, despite the presence of some genuinely interesting and stimulating parts. Part of my issue with this book comes from some of the editorial choices that were made. As I said earlier, there are 36 chapters in this collection. This would certainly be appropriate for a larger handbook, but this is clearly too much within the limited space of the present book. As a result, chapters feel either rushed or decidedly too narrow in scope. Chapter 31 describes an extended 2-year longitudinal study with three youth orchestras involving a multidisciplinary team in a mere four pages. Crucial details that would allow readers to assess the validity of the choices made by the research team are bound to be excluded in such a cramped space: for example, the statistical analysis performed by the researchers are not described or explained, nor are we provided with any rationale for the protocols used to assess the children’s motor coordination. Conversely, Chapter 12 introduces a substantial amount of quantitative data on the rehearsal talk between two musicians over a seven-day rehearsal period but without really managing to provide the reader with a sense of a broader research context, making it hard to know what to really take from this case study. Overall, I cannot help but feel that the editors could have selected fewer chapters, thus allowing their authors to present in more details their study and to connect them more convincingly to the relevant literature (from this perspective, it is symptomatic that most of the case studies quote very few references, sometimes only two or three). It would have also helped in avoiding some unnecessary redundancies (there are for example two very similar studies on ensemble leadership within educational settings in the first part, and many overlaps of references and theoretical framings in the chapters from the third part, dedicated to collective music-making and wellbeing). With such a diverse collection of chapters, total consistency is likely not to be expected. But statements that strongly clash with each other could probably have been avoided or editorially managed. For example, Chapter 22 presents a fascinating analysis of early recordings from",Music &amp; Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1177/20592043221127544', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/20592043221127544?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/20592043221127544, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The Translational Research (TR) approach has as one of its main objectives the acceleration of the innovation process, based on the transposition from basic science to applied science and innovation, which comprises the different stages of research, development and innovation. The literature points out that the dynamics of translation, which results in new technologies, are complex, transdisciplinary, inter-institutional, systemic, and non-linear. The main objective of this review is to contribute to the adoption of institutional strategies and the formulation of public policies aimed at solving today’s social and economic challenges, ensuring access to technologies and sustainability for the health system. The specific objectives were: (i) to systematize studies that characterized translational research in medical devices; (ii) map the challenges for the implementation of translational health research; (iii) contribute to the design of institutional strategies; and (iv) support the formulation of public policies. Methods This study used the scoping review technique, according to PRISMA-ScR and the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines. Concerning the extraction of relevant articles, the journals indexed in Bireme, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were consulted for selecting relevant articles. The search was carried out on November 28, 2021, updated on April 29, 2022, and there were no restrictions as to the year of publication, language or type of analysis. Studies that did not answer the research question were excluded, as they dealt exclusively with the pharmaceutical segment, the translation of knowledge into clinical practice, or addressed the process of translational research applied to specific diseases or technologies. Results Thirty-three articles were included indicating that the approach of translation of research is multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary and encompasses knowledge and aspects that go beyond basic and applied research and incorporates final steps concerning regulatory aspects, clinical research, market analysis, technology transfer, production and incorporation of technologies into the health system.",Frontiers in Digital Health,2022.0,4,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2022.957367/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9385029, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

66c2d2a0d942b5df7c3ea83e94c3669da28183a0,Enhancing Post-Covid Student Proficiency and Confidence in Using Laboratory Test Equipment,"Because of the Covid-19 Pandemic during academic year 2020-2021, many of the classes and laboratories in our undergraduate Electrical Engineering (EE) program were conducted remotely, making tremendous use of videoconferencing technologies such as Microsoft Teams, and simulation engines such as National Instruments' MultiSimTM. As we began to move back to “in person” learning for the Fall of 2021, our EE faculty observed some early weaknesses in student achievement of ABET EE student outcome #6 (an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions). We found that while students demonstrated excellent proficiency in using modern tools such as MATLABTM and MultiSimTM (which had been used extensively during remote classes), they appeared considerably weaker in making independent measurements using laboratory hardware such as oscilloscopes, dynamic signal analyzers (FFT analyzers), RF analyzers, and even commonly used voltage and current meters (which had not been used much during remote learning). Here we highlight specific student shortcomings we observed in laboratory skills as students began their in-person lab experiences during the Fall 2021 semester. We then discuss our approaches to remedy these shortcomings during the Fall 2021 semester to improve student confidence and proficiency in the use of laboratory instrumentation. We also highlight the improvements we saw in achievement of ABET student outcomes. While computer simulation has its place in undergraduate education, practical testing and measurement of electronic systems does require physical measurement and interaction using modern test equipment, and we identified some areas for timely improvement. Our focus in this paper is on improved student performance in using laboratory test equipment in Linear Circuits and Antennas courses. In the Linear Circuits course, students use the Oscilloscope and Dynamic Signal Analyzer to identify the characteristics of several op-amps and circuits (e.g, op-amp open-loop frequency response, gain-bandwidth product, slew rate, output impedance, closed-loop frequency response of an inverting amplifier), and in the in the Antennas course students use the RF analyzer to characterize the behavior of RF circuits, transmission lines and antennas. We show how our increased emphasis on lab skills for the Fall 2021 semester, coupled with unique assessment tools, significantly improved achievement of student outcome #6. More specifically we share the successes we experienced in using oral individual quizzes during lab meetings, group classroom quizzes, individual student observation of setup and measurement, and adding questions related to lab skills and experiences on hourly examinations. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/40767.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--40767?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--40767, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

18f96c30a9324cc9a9edc7573454f691b2e47bc2,STEM Program for Female Students during COVID-19 Pandemic,"Despite helping to solve problems in society and the environment and enabling financial independence, a disproportionately low number of women enter engineering careers. Contributing factors may include a lack of female role models and activities that would increase the interest and confidence in STEM pathways during the developing years. Our university has initiated activities to provide exposure to role models and STEM activities to young females. This year Ron Burton Training Village (RBTV) started a new STEM program for female students grades 6-11 which would span over 6 years. The students would attend a different experience every weekend and conclude the yearly experience with a capstone project. Our university partnered with RBTV for one weekend workshop experience. The program was intended to be an in-person event but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this program was conducted synchronously through Zoom virtual meetings. Our university is well known for “hands-on” learning, and we decided to keep the experience hands-on even if it had to be virtual. Students participated in STEM-related hands-on projects, connecting them to real life applications and boosting students' interests in different STEM disciplines. The program represents part of our university's ongoing efforts to interest young women in STEM. The core of the half-day workshop was three 45-minute STEM modules: Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The students rotated between the different workshops. The three modules are presented in this paper. Civil Engineering project was Soil Testing, Electrical Engineering project was Food Battery, and Computer Science project was Smart Picker. 38 female students participated in this new STEM program. A survey was conducted at the end of the event to evaluate the content of the program. Students were excited about our program, learning, and experiencing different fields of engineering. We received very positive feedback from the students. The students really enjoyed the hands-on experience. Students reflected that they would like to participate in more STEM related activities in the future. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/41643.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41643?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41643, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ec65d4849c3c5ba38c6c743e55ab6004c292954e,Assessing Effectiveness of Different Teaching Modalities in Linear Circuits I,"The four- and six-year graduation rates (~17.7% and ~64.5% respectively) of engineering (ENGR), are below the University's average graduation rates (~ 33.1% and 67.4%). The goal of this study is to seek solutions towards increasing the graduation rates and ultimately decreasing the time-to-graduation. There are several steps that could be taken to help the engineering students graduate earlier. Examples are summer bridge programs that focus on strengthening mathematical skills of students, encouraging students to attend tutoring sessions and practice problem-solving. One of the factors that add to the time-to-graduation of students is not being able to pass the lower division courses that serve as the prerequisite to other discipline courses. The result will be high DFW rate courses which students repeat several times before they can pass them and pursue other courses that rely on these high DFW courses. This can adversely affect the student's sense of belonging and decrease the retention rate. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all courses, including some of the high DFW courses, were taught in various modalities. This has created different results and perceptions by students. The Linear Circuits I is a high DFW rate course in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of CSU Chico. In this study, the author, who has taught this course in four different modalities, looks closely at the results of this class and compares the effect of different teaching modalities on the DFW rates. The author will also reflect on the effectiveness of each of the teaching modes, student engagement, and student feedback on each mode. The results could be used for the recommendation of teaching modalities if the course is offered online again due to a pandemic or other need. Additionally, the lessons learned and the technology related features of online instruction can be integrated with in-person instruction to increase the effectiveness of teaching. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/40595.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--40595?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--40595, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

41d60d2b9ef5fcf0b539464dd0faf75f927b60b4,An Improvement of an Engineering Course that Presents and Promotes the NAE’s Twenty First Century Grand Challenges and Program,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted society and engineering education as a whole. This paper describes the strategies and improvements that were implemented post COVID-19 pandemic to a two-credit hour engineering course targeted for first-year engineering and exploratory studies students at a Southeastern Public Research One Institution. It introduces the Grand Challenges and a corresponding scholars program defined by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) that link society and engineering to improve and maintain quality of life for the twenty-first century. This course was developed to enhance student development in the essential engineering mindset and interdisciplinary system thinking to address the prescribed global engineering grand challenges. It interweaves engineering with the social and political sciences, encouraging students to explore the interactions between society and technology, including the influences of human behavior, culture, economics, ethics, and policy on the development and implementation of technologies. The course delivery is hybrid in nature, where students meet and actively engage face-to-face once a week and participate in an asynchronous meeting in the other half of the week. The curriculum includes invited speakers and experts in the various engineering disciplines, recorded videos, a midterm research essay, and a final group poster presentation and one-minute video on one of the Grand Challenges. The final presentation encompasses the four themes of the NAE's Grand Challenges and showcases the students' gained and applied knowledge for exploring opportunities to solve complex engineering challenges. The course is offered in the fall and summer semesters to over 1,500 students per academic year. All students who take this course and matriculate into their engineering major then can apply to the Grand Challenges Scholars Program (GCSP) to participate in the program as early as their sophomore year. Approximately 30 students are accepted into the university GCSP and may begin participating in the GCSP as soon as the summer prior to their sophomore year and have three years to complete the five required competencies of this program. Approximately 90 scholars actively participate in this program every year (sophomore, junior and senior engineering students). The five competencies include talent, multiculturalism, multidisciplinary studies, entrepreneurship and social cognition. Typically, the scholars start taking engineering classes and start working with research mentors to assist with the completion of the five competencies that prepare them to solve these challenges. Most incoming scholars lack experience in identifying specific research mentors. This program assists with that task. Through the first competency, also known as talent, the scholars engage in hands-on projects to help design innovative solutions through deep immersion in an academically rigorous environment. This paper describes the improvement efforts post COVID-19 to the course goals, structures, designs, and targeted recruitment efforts for the GCSP during the face-to-face and online course delivery, focusing on engineering research and introducing interested students to how to identify a research topic and choose a mentor. In addition, it includes reflections and insights gained from the course design, development, and facilitation, and offers future recommendations for improvements. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/41433.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41433?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41433, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a10b6c98957b04b275493f26bb9423e0d7eec058,An occupational perspective on COVID-19,"Dr Birgit Prodinger The COVID-19 global pandemic urges occupational scientists to examine such world events through an occupational lens. Few other events have been experienced in such a significant way across the globe and, whilst the impact and response has differed in different geographies, we have all experienced – temporarily or continuously – occupational disruption. Reflecting that global impact, the papers in this issue were submitted by authors from Europe, Africa, Australasia, and North America, providing readers with a variety of perspectives. Many educators of occupational science and/or occupational therapy took innovative approaches to their teaching and learning and required their students to examine howCOVID-19 and the public health responses impacted on their lives as students. The first three papers in this issue are examples with students from Turkey and from the US. The students in Turkey examined their time use in relation to occupational balance and temporal life satisfaction during the isolation period in May 2020 (Salar et al., 2022). Students who spent more time in study, socialising, and exercise had better occupational balance and those who spent more time watching TV had lower occupational balance. Socialising and exercise were adapted to occur within the confines of the home. To understand the impact of the pandemic on people’s daily lives, it can be worthwhile to compare what people have done prior to the pandemic. Werner and Jozkowski (2022) did so in examining the time use of US students during in comparison to one year prior to the pandemic. Students used visual representations as well as lists to report on their time use. The study revealed that driving was not reported as an occupation throughout the pandemic at all. Significant changes were revealed in time spent in studying, rest, and sleep. Also studying US university students’ experiences, Krishnagiri and Atler (2022) examined the adaptation of occupations, in particular social occupations, and their interaction with health and well-being in the earlier phase of the pandemic. Next to laying out how students experienced and underwent changes in occupations, the authors provide portraits of three students to illustrate the dynamics of doing, being, becoming, and belonging. Wegner et al. (2022) pivoted a student assignment to explore young adults’ leisure experiences in South Africa during the pandemic. The authors then took a meta-analytic approach to synthesise and thematically analyse the findings from the student’s work. Findings revealed occupational disruption to the lives of the young people during the confinement, particularly leisure and social occupations, however they adapted and developed new leisure occupations.

d057ebd1e54b04839ffd7a4ed26d92b4f207d98c,"Improving Traumatic Brain Injury Care and Research: A Report From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) takes a substantial toll on health and health care costs in the US. Yet TBI is often unrecognized, misclassified, undertreated (especially in its longer-term manifestations), and, in proportion to its public health consequences, underresearched. Despite the dedication of an increasing number of professionals, disciplines,andorganizationsdevotedtoTBIcareandresearch, includinginnovativeprogramsformilitaryservicemembers and veterans, care often fails to meet the needs of affected individuals, families, and communities. The US lacks consolidatedleadershipforachievingimprovementsinTBIcare andoutcomes,and,partlyasaresult, it lacksastrategicplan for fostering change and overseeing progress. With stronger leadership and proper redesign, the health care system could reduce the morbidity and disability associated with TBI, while enhancing the effectiveness of TBI care. These are among the conclusions of a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, Traumatic Brain Injury: A Roadmap for Accelerating Progress,1 written by an 18-member committee, which met over 15 months from 2020 to 2022, gathered testimony from more than 50 researchers, practitioners, patients, and families who experienced TBI and its sequelae, and analyzed evidence from peer-reviewed publications. While the report acknowledges the importance of prevention, its focus is on postinjury care. TBI encompasses injuries of vastly different severity and causation ranging from concussions during sports participation, to head trauma from falls in older adults, to skull fracturesfromautomobilecrashes,topenetratingwounds from projectiles and military combat, and to many other causes of neurotrauma. A consolidated registry is lacking, but data from 2009 and 2010 suggested that an estimated 4.8 million people were evaluated for TBI in US emergency departments each year, and data from 2013 suggested that TBI was diagnosed in approximately 2% of total emergency visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US.2,3 In 2017, TBI contributed to an estimated 224 000 hospitalizations and 61 000 deaths, and 2.5 million high school students reported having experienced at least 1 concussion.4,5 Worldwide, more than 55 million people are estimated to experience a “mild” TBI and 5.5 million are estimated to experience a “severe” TBI each year.6 TBI is more than an acute event. Although many individuals who experience a so-called mild TBI, such as a concussion, recover in weeks, others report ongoing symptoms for much longer.7 Many people who experience severe TBI are challenged with chronic, or even lifetime, morbidity and disability. The consequent physical and psychological effects and the economic costs for patients, families, and communities are high. An estimated 2.5 million caregivers in the US are supporting a family member with TBI.8 Lifetime financial costs in health care, lost income, and reduced quality of life are difficult to measure but have been estimated to be as high as $750 billion for the estimated 2 million people who experience TBI in the US each year.9 Despite its magnitude as a public health problem, TBI continues to be misunderstood and not optimally managed. Not all brain insults are identified or reported as such at the time of injury or during acute triage. The public, and many clinicians, may not realize that even the “mildest” TBIs can have downstream effects and could benefit from follow-up care, timely rehabilitation, and social and psychological support. TBI follow-up is often inadequate. Individuals with mild TBI may not receive a referral for follow-up or have no contact with a clinician after hospital discharge, even when they experience symptoms, and clinicians and patients may fail to realize that subsequent symptoms are connected to a prior TBI. Even when impairments from injury are evident, one estimate from 2012 suggested that only 13% to 25% of people with moderate, severe, or penetrating TBI received interdisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation.10 During its public workshops, the committee heard painful testimony from patients and families who, although grateful for superb acute care, felt lost and abandoned by the health care system in the months and years that followed, as they tried to cope with significant physical and psychological sequelae. Part of the problem of underrecognition and undertreatment is that categorization of TBI as “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” does not reflect the state of scientific knowledge. Injuries labeled as mild can have downstream morbidity, while severe cases may sometimes achieve levels of recovery that violate conventional wisdom. A more evidence-basedapproach,combiningclinicalpresentation and the time-honored Glasgow Coma Scale score with advances in biomarkers and imaging, is needed to improve assessment, inform triage, and bolster treatment guidelines. By way of analogy, the report observes, “Today, one couldnotimagineclassifyingcanceras‘mild,moderate,and severe’ for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.”1 Rather than viewing TBI as an acute physiological event, the report proposes a “bio-psychosocioecological” model, using multiple lenses through which to appreciate the needs and condition of people living with TBI.Thatmodelhighlightstheimportanceofasystem-wide health care approach able to anticipate and respond to needs in a coordinated fashion, with regular reassessment of care plans. It also emphasizes the importance of a focus on racial and socioeconomic equity. The report further recommends that the National Academies’ specifications for a “learning health care system” be applied to the approach to TBI care nationally, regionally, and locally.

Early detection of breast cancer using breast self-examination plays a substantial role in reducing its morbidity and mortality. Despite improved availability of health information the morbidity and mortality caused by breast cancer among females were increasing from time to time and there is no information regarding the practice of breast self-examination in our study area. Objective This study was aimed at assessing breast self-examination practice and associated factors among female health professionals who were working in public hospitals of Harari Regional State in 2022. Methods Institutional-based quantitative cross-sectional study design was used to assess the practice of breast self-examination and associated factors among female health professionals who have been working in a public hospital in Harari regional state from March 25 to April 05, 2022. The study subjects were selected using a simple random sampling technique and data were collected by a self-administered and structured questionnaire. The collected data was edited, cleaned, coded, and entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 software and analyzed using the statistical package for social science software version 20. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to see the association between independent and dependent variables. Variable with P-value less than 0.05 at final model were regarded as statistically significant. Result Among a total of 362 female health professionals, 171 (47.2%) respondents were ever practiced breast self-examination, 229(63.3%) had good knowledge of breast self-examination and 252(69.6%) had a favorable attitude toward breast self-examination. Work experience of ≥5 year (AOR = 2.51; 95% CI: 1.31–4.82), educational status of degree and above (AOR = 7.2; 95% CI: 3.82–10.58), good knowledge about breast self-examination (AOR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.41–5.40) and favorable attitude toward breast self-examination (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 2.11–4.10) were significantly associated with breast self-examination practice. Conclusion The finding of this study implies that the practice of breast self-examination among female health professionals is low. Work experience of ≥5 year, educational status of degree and above, having a good knowledge and favorable attitude toward breast self-examination were significantly associated with breast self-examination.",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0,5,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.1002111/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9721260, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0350b1074a97d9fcc8186dc125138fbea54a8ce1,Tectonics of the Colorado Plateau and Its Margins,"The Cenozoic Colorado Plateau physiographic province overlies multiple Precambrian provinces. Its ∼2-km elevation rim surrounds an ∼1.6-km elevation core that is underlain by thicker crust and lithospheric mantle, with a sharp structural transition ∼100 km concentrically inboard of the physiographic boundary on all but its northeastern margin. The region was uplifted in three episodes: ∼70–50 Ma uplift above sea level driven by flat-slab subduction; ∼38–23 Ma uplift associated with voluminous regional magmatism and slab removal, and less than 20 Ma uplift associated with inboard propagation of basaltic magmatism that tracked convective erosion of the lithospheric core. Neogene uplift helped integrate the Colorado River from the Rockies at 11 Ma to the Gulf of California by ∼5 Ma. The sharp rim-to-core transition defined by geological and geophysical data sets suggests a young transient plateau that is uplifting as it shrinks to merge with surrounding regions of postorogenic extension. ▪ The Colorado Plateau's iconic landscapes were shaped during its 70-million-year, still-enigmatic, tectonic evolution characterized by uplift and erosion. ▪ Uplift of the Colorado Plateau from sea level took place in three episodes, the youngest of which has been ongoing for the past 20 million years. ▪ Tectonism across the Colorado Plateau's nearest plate margin (the base of the plate!) is driving uplift and volcanism and enhancing its rugged landscapes. ▪ The bowl-shaped Colorado Plateau province is defined by ongoing uplift and an inboard sweep of magmatism around its margins. ▪ The keel of the Colorado Plateau is being thinned as the North American plate moves southwest through the underlying mantle.

50eba7cc4abf721ab0b945a644ac5ee7880fc3d4,Changing of the guard,"At the ICCB in Montpelier (2015) I met with the Society for Conservation Biology (SCB) elected officials, journal editors, and everyone I could on an idea that had been haunting me. I felt that the SCB was missing an important opportunity to serve the community of conservation scholars. My rationale was simple: SCB was precluding the bulk of conservation science by holding to the standard of seeking to publish papers that transcend individual species or geographies. Further, the obsession with novelty left little opportunity to replicate studies and build the evidence base needed for conservation practice. We needed to add journal space for the majority of conservation science. The SCB's mission includes supporting a growing international community in conservation science. This community includes both researchers and practitioners. With the existing journals, SCB was thinking globally, but not acting locally. By failing to publish research of primarily local interest, SCB was falling short in helping build needed bridges between scholarship and practice. To increase Society impact, I argued, we needed to provide journal space where our global community of students, practitioners, and researchers could publish work showing how they applied existing tools to specific conservation targets in specific locations. My argument received strong support from both SCB and Wiley, our publishing partner, at every step of the process. Nevertheless, it took over 3 years, and countless meetings, to actually launch Conservation Science and Practice (CSP) in 2019. After working to establish the journal through the SCB publications committee, I had the honor to be selected as the inaugural Editor-in-Chief. Happily, CSP has exceeded expectations in every single metric of success that SCB and Wiley set through its first 3 years. Beginning with just 16 Associate Editors (AEs), CSP has grown to three Senior Associate Editors, over 60 AEs. Submissions have increased significantly each year. With CSP, SCB demonstrated that there is room for journals willing to publish local, practiceoriented conservation research. The outpouring of support from our community of scholarship endorsing the need for a journal that seeks to engage practitioners has been astounding and, personally, touching. To make progress on the biodiversity crisis, we need an army of researcher–practitioner partnerships working on the thousands of conservation challenges facing the globe. We need even more journal space to foster growth in this knowledge base, and other journals such as Ecological Solutions and Evidence are entering this space. I am proud of our CSP accomplishments in these early years. Midway through 2022, CSP has published approximately the same number of papers (194) as Conservation Biology and Conservation Letters combined (203), making it our largest Society journal. With a 3.57 (2021) Impact Factor, CSP has, in my opinion, hit the sweet spot. We want CSP to publish papers that are cited; be a journal of high repute. But we also want to be able to publish the specific outcomes of specific projects in specific locations. That means not striving to maximize our Impact Factor. Solid science is our model, and it is working. Hitting this mark has been a journey. Reviewers can mistake CSP for a journal that is striving toward the relentless focus on novelty, as opposed to a journal where scientists and practitioners focus on conservation outcomes obtained using our existing conservation toolkit. I am perhaps proudest to have been part of launching two unusual paper formats. Our Innovations in Practice (beginning in 2019 as “Evidence” and renamed in 2021) papers (e.g., Dube and Kavho 2022; Kusmanoff et al. 2022) provide a venue for practitioners to report on outcomes of programs and actions in a much less formal way than the typical contributed paper. In 2022, we added a second unusual paper type, Scientific Impact Papers (500 words). Since we hope that the work we publish has an impact on the ground, we have invited authors to report when scholarship leads to action. Through these two paper types, we hope to further contribute to the evidence base for conservation practitioners.

This presented a challenge on how to deliver a team centered hands-on design project in our sophomore level material and energy balance course. As part of this project, teams are required not only to research, design, construct, evaluate, test and report on their product, but also to develop a mathematical model to predict their product's performance. It is important that the students have a fun yet inexpensive project to design and build, but they must also develop a mathematical understanding of the fundamental engineering principles that make their design work. Through this mathematical modeling the student cultivates the connection between mathematics and science, as well as understanding the fundamental engineering principles that make their products work. This paper will describe the details of the design project, which includes the design criteria and constraints, how the students are introduced to the project through a professionally produced introductory video, and an introduction to the engineering design and decision-making process, while also teaching basic engineering concepts. Activities will be provided which helped to scaffold the underlying math and science concepts to support the design decisions. CATME was utilized in forming design teams - while balancing the teams by schedule, gender, race/ethnicity, GPA, and in-person/online. This allowed team members to participate equitably by developing the mathematical model (which was not restricted to the online students) and building and testing the product (in-person students with input from the online students) (while remaining socially distanced and testing outdoors) and all team members worked on the final design project report. Design testing videos and pictures will be included to illustrate the variety of successful design solutions - in addition, the list of design materials which were provided for the teams to select from for the construction of their design. The results of this project (fall 2020) will be compared to (fall 2021 - under a less restrictive COVID protocol) and pre-COVID (2002, 2008 and 2011) semesters - when this project was used in a first-year introduction to engineering design course. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/41891.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41891?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41891, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4a7984b3fe899a6d3ffc0dee27b5e59b389f8ed3,Mortality dynamics of a polyphagous invasive herbivore reveal clues in its agroecosystem success,"Abstract BACKGROUND The population dynamics of polyphagous pests such as Bemisia argentifolii (B. tabaci MEAM1) are governed by complex, interacting factors involving its cultivated and wild host plants, seasonality, movement and demography. To understand mechanisms contributing to population development and pest success within the agroecosystem, contiguous multi‐host field sites were established in three environmentally distinct areas in Arizona. Life tables quantified and partition models described mortality sources and rates for immature insect stages on each host plant. RESULTS Predation and dislodgement were the largest sources of marginal mortality, supplied the highest irreplaceable mortality and predation was the key factor. Rates of mortality were best predicted, in order, by source, temperature, host plant and season. Marginal mortality was highest for fourth‐stage nymphs followed by eggs. Mortality rates were predicted in descending order by stage, temperature and season. Survivorship patterns varied among host plants, and generational mortality averaged 70% on spring cantaloupes but nearly 95% on all other hosts. Population density varied seasonally, persisting at low levels on winter hosts and expanding beginning in the spring; perennial hosts and weeds bridge populations year‐round. CONCLUSION Survival on winter hosts such as broccoli, albeit low, enables population continuity, whereas unusually high survivorship on spring crops like cantaloupe is an ecological release propelling population growth and driving regional dynamics in the summer and fall. This detailed understanding of mortality dynamics provides clues to the success of this invasive pest in our agroecosystems and facilitates opportunities for improved pest management at a broader landscape scale. © 2022 The Authors.

de79f6ce693f6e6bb45094c909c01e641b8d1698,"Preface to the special section ‘Soil C and N response to climate, land-use and management changes (Soil C, N and CLUMC)’","Rockstrom et al. (2009) proposed ‘Planetary Boundaries’ which is a concept involving Earth system processes that contain environmental boundaries. In the framework, nitrogen (N) cycle, rate of biodiversity loss and climate change have been transgressed by humanity already. In 2015, the United Nations (UN) established the global agenda for sustainable development until 2030 and defined it as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including 17 specified goals with 169 targets. Many goals were related to land use and management changes (LUMC) with carbon (C) and N dynamics among atmospherebiosphere-pedosphere systems with agricultural activities, such as Zero Hunger (Goal 2), Climate Action (Goal 13), Life on Land (Goal 13) and so on (https://www.undp.org/sustainabledevelopment-goals). Soils could be C sinks or sources depending on climate, land use and management changes (CLUMC) in different plant-soil ecosystems. Soil N and its dynamics not only affect plant growth and crop production but also control soil C sequestration. Thus, C and N dynamics affected by CLUMC in terrestrial ecosystems contribute not only to global and local environmental problems, including global warming, destruction of the ozone layer, acid rain, and eutrophication, but also to changes in soil fertility and crop production related to human sustainable development (Cheng 2020). Many of our colleagues around the world are studying the C and N dynamics by CLUMC in different regions and countries with various ecosystems. We need to share our knowledge and learn from each other researches and discuss how to do the next studies for the UN-SDGs. Therefore, we have held the ‘International Symposium on C and N Dynamics by Land Use and Management Changes in East and Southeast Asian Countries’ on September 10–12, 2018 in Tsuruoka campus, Yamagata University, Japan, and published a special section in Soil Science and Plant Nutrition (SSPN) titled as ‘Soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics by land use and management changes in East and Southeast Asian countries (Soil C and N by LUMC).’ There were 20 papers in the special section, including 4 review papers and 16 original articles (Cheng 2020). Many papers in the special section have been cited many times during the last 2 years. Two years late, we planed the second international symposium for similar topics on September 28–30, 2020 in Tsuruoka, Japan again. Since the outbreaks of COVID-19 pandemic around the world from January 2020, we could not invite and receive guests from foreign countries. Therefore, we decided to hold an International Online Symposium (IOS) on Soil C and N Dynamics by Land Use, Management, and Climate Changes. In this virtual symposium, a total 56 of our colleagues in 14 countries around the world participated and presented their newest research results in this IOS (Figure 1). More than 80 young students in many universities have joined the IOS to learn the front knowledge in the world (Figure 2). The IOS also celebrated Professor Kazuyuki INUBUSHI will officially retire from Chiba University in March 2021 since many of his former students around the world joined the IOS together even during the COVID-19 pandemic period. As much of the research presented in the IOS is valuable, original, and has not been published yet, we organized a special section ‘Soil C and N response to climate, land-use and management changes (Soil C, N and CLUMC)’ in SSPN. In addition, we also collected original related papers from colleagues around the world who did not attend the symposium. Finally, we accepted 20 papers, including 2 review papers and 18 original articles, for publishing in this special section of Soil C, N and CLUMC. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities are causing climate change, including global warming. To slow climate change requires reducing these emissions. The government of many countries declared that they would realize carbon-neutrality (net-zero carbon emissions) by around 2050. Net-zero emissions will be achieved when all GHGs (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), etc.) emissions released by human activities are counterbalanced by removing GHGs from the atmosphere in a process known as carbon removal. Since the forests are a very important sink of atmospheric GHGs, we need to understand the real potentials of forests for mitigating climate change. In this special section, Sase et al. (2022) reviewed the reactive nitrogen (Nr) from the atmosphere by both domestic and transboundary air pollution and its dynamics in center Japan from their long-term investigation. The current atmospheric dissolved inorganic N is still high, at over 10 kg ha year, which implied the C sequestration and CH4 absorption and N2O emission should be affected by the Nr deposition. Xu (2022) reviewed the effect of freeze-thaw disturbance on soil C and N dynamics and GHG fluxes of East Asia forests according to the laboratory and field measurements. His review showed freeze-thaw disturbance mostly increased concentrations and leaching fluxes of",Soil science and plant nutrition (Tokyo),2022.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00380768.2022.2039985?needAccess=true', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/00380768.2022.2039985?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2022.2039985, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0cc22da7e0336b2e14ae7119a4eafe35a3737e7a,Healthcare Analytics: Applications and Challenges,"Present day decision making in healthcare has become a data-intensive process leading to the rise of healthcareanalytics. These analytics involve the integration and analysis of data collected from multiple heterogenoussources including biomedical data (electronic health records), experimental (R&D) data, patient lifestyle andbehavior data (store records, social media, wearable electronic devices etc) and financial data. Healthcareanalytics is further being transformed by the application of current - omics technologies (genomics,epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, pharmacogenomics etc), shifting healthcare to asystem that is “predictive, preventive, participatory, and personalized”, referred to as the P4 medicineparadigm. The omics revolution is generating a huge amount of data that needs to be collected, stored,transformed, analyzed and ultimately delivered in a format that is understandable to the clinicians. Properlyapplied, healthcare analytics provide actionable insights that can lead to improvement in healthcaremanagement and delivery, clinical outcomes, health policies and allocation of health resources to communitiesin need. 
Medical institutions worldwide are facing many challenges. There is a shortage of trained human resource,patients are more demanding and regulators are becoming more stringent. The healthcare systems are underpressure to provide better and safer healthcare that is also more cost-effective. This is leading to thedevelopment of a whole new healthcare analytics industry to capture, store and analyze big data for healthcareproviders, health system leaders, and those in government health and human services to improve healthcaredelivery and outcomes. A report by McKinsey Global Institute published in 2011 estimated that if US healthcarewere to use big data creatively and effectively, the sector could create more than $300 billion in value everyyear.1 
While innovative new technologies and platforms are making it possible to capture vast amounts ofinformation of individual patient over a large timescale, a large amount of data remains underutilized andwasted. It is estimated that healthcare providers discard around 90% of the data that they produce.1 One of thegreatest challenges in healthcare analytics is harvesting the data from multiple complex and heterogenoussources spread across different healthcare systems, health insurers, scientists, government bodies etc. andtransforming it to generate meaningful information. Moreover, the personal and financial data and medicalrecords of patients required to contribute to effective analytical platforms may be confidential and private andtherefore inaccessible. Hospitals are also reluctant to share their financial and clinical audits. There is the issuealso of ownership of the data and in many countries patient data is legally possessed by the patient. Even so thehealthcare industry, slow to transition towards data mining and IT solutions, has now begun to adapt to thedigital data age. Algorithms for collecting, compressing, anonymizing and sharing medical data are beingdeveloped by different groups in addition to various platforms specific to healthcare analytics. 
The implementation of healthcare analytics, particularly in developing countries like Pakistan where mosthealthcare facilities lack even the most basic form of EHRs is a formidable challenge. Pakistan has a robust ITcommunity with a special interest and investment by the government sector in IT and Artificial Intelligenceplatforms. Pakistan government last year announced seed money of Rs 1.1 billion, to carry out a three-yearproject on AI, through the Higher Education Commission to be conducted by six universities. One of theseprojects, related to medical imaging and diagnostics, is a step in the right direction. However, we still have a long way to go if we are to reap the benefits of healthcare analytics in Pakistan. There is a need for the involvement and commitment of all stakeholders including healthcare facilities, academicians, researchers and industry etc to contribute to this endeavor. There is no shortage of qualified human resource in the country. All that is required is the will of the health sector to invest in this golden opportunity for healthcare analytics to play a role in improving the delivery of cost-effective care, save lives and define health policies in Pakistan.

5966c46fc05a90ee748c0ca46aaeb99b481b940c,Relationship between the caregiver burden and the resilience among primary caregivers of individuals suffering from schizophrenia attending tertiary care rural hospital from central India: A cross-sectional observational study,"Introduction: Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder prevalent across the globe. Because of its chronic course, most of the individuals with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment which may pose financial, physical, and mental burden over the primary caregivers. So, while taking care of the individuals with schizophrenia over a prolonged period, caregivers themselves can suffer from the burden in the form of depression, anxiety, and stress. Objective: To study the relationship between caregiver burden in the form of depression, anxiety and stress, and the resilience among the primary caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia. Methodology: Present crosssectional study was carried out by the department of Psychiatry of a tertiary care rural teaching hospital from Maharashtra, India. Data were collected from 80 primary caregivers by using standard questionnaires like Depression, Anxiety and Stress – 21 item (DASS-21) scale to measure the caregiver burden and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) to measure the levels of resilience. Results: Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress were 55%, 35%, and 48.7% respectively. Significant negative correlation was observed between resilience levels and depression (r= -0.23), anxiety (r= -0.35), and stress (r= -0.24), suggesting that the probability of the caregiver burden increases with decline in the level of resilience. Conclusion: Based on the findings, we recommend that regular individual as well as group sessions should be conducted for the primary caregivers to strengthen their resilience so that they can not only Medical Science pISSN 2321–7359; eISSN 2321–7367 To Cite: Shukla RS, Ghogare AS, Patil PS.

3d913024d0e43ea8369c7497161b13a1f61e932b,Volvulus of Colon Sigmoide in the General Surgery Department of Chu Gabriel Toure,"Introduction: Sigmoid colon volvulus is a medico-surgical emergency which represents a common cause of colonic occlusion, it is characterized by strangulation of the sigmoid loop around its meso colic axis producing low mechanical occlusion [1]. Apart from this form conventionally described, the volvulus of the sigmoid colon can occur along an organoaxial axis. This form has been highlighted in the literature thanks to the diagnostic contribution of multi-detector scanners [2]. Objective: To determine the hospital frequency of sigmoid colon volvulus; to write the clinical and para-clinical aspects of sigmoid colon volvulus; write down the different treatments used for the management of sigmoid colon volvulus. Material and methods: This was a retrospective and prospective study that took place from January 2008 to December 2020 in the General Surgery Department of Gabriel Touré. The retrospective phase ran from January 2008 to December 2019 and the prospective phase from January 2020 to December 2020. Results: From January 2008 to December 2020, we collected 320 cases of patients operated on for sigmoid colon volvulus out of 7989 surgical emergencies over a 12-year period, or 3.64%. In our study, the most represented age group was between 16 and 60 years old, i.e. 81.88%. The mean age was 42.6 ± 17.4 years with extremities of 16 and 90 years. The male sex was the most represented, 89% with a sex ratio of 8.41. The surgical history was found in 13.75% of our patients. The clinic was dominated by abdominal pain (100%), meteorism (100%), and gas and matter arrest (91.3%). The most common radiological image found in the ASP was the double jamb, i.e. 74.69% of cases.

Effective learning one of which is influenced by the use of teaching materials. Preliminary investigation data at SMPN 25 Padang show that there is no teaching material in the form of an e-module that can visualize the subject matter as a whole. Based on the results of the questionnaire, it is known that 67.16% of students have difficulty understanding the concepts of the respiratory system and the excretory system. This causes the low learning outcomes for students, so teaching materials are needed that can assist in visualizing the subject matter as a whole. This study aims to produce an e-module based on problem based learning using adobe flash professional CS6 on the material of the human respiratory and excretory systems for students of class VIII that is valid, practical, and effective. This type of research is the Plomp model development research which consists of three phase, namely the initial preliminary research phase, the development or prototyping phase, and the assessment phase. The research subjects are students of class VIII SMPN 25 Padang Academic Year 2021-2022. The research data were obtained from validity, practicality, and effectiveness tests. The validity test data was obtained through a validation sheet by lecturers as validators. Practical test data was obtained from the results of the questionnaire response analysis of teachers and students. Effectiveness test data were obtained from multiple choice question sheets for assessing cognitive competence, observation sheets for assessing affective competence and psychomotor competence, and essay question sheets for assessing students creative thinking skills. The results of validation by validators on the e-module based on problem-based learning show an average value of 86.35% (very valid). The results of the practicality assessment by science teachers showed an average of 90.87% (very practical) and the results of the practicality assessment by students obtained an average value of 89.25% (very practical). The results of the effectiveness test from the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor aspects of students showed that the problem based learning based e-module was very effective and the value of creative thinking skills obtained an average of 74.24 (creative).

80a143aa91388f6830f2a99d203e4a1c2a92823e,Normalization after Covid-19 Pandemic: Way Forward Towards Healthy Recovery,"The world as we know has changed. While a global pandemic has been an ominous risk for decades, COVID-19 came as a jolt, characterized by the functional interdependencies of the social, economic and public health systems. The initial shock and systemic failures from policy unpreparedness, not only bared open the fault lines of social injustice and inequity, but also led to xenophobic orientation and conspiratorial thinking. Social isolation, mental health illness, redundancies, financial difficulties and permanent closure of many businesses were the fall out of this crisis.  The world adapted and moved from physical to digital. Financial systems, education, industry and entertainment were restructured and decentralized. The pandemic also had significant effect on the sociopolitical trends including sense of human solidarity, rebuilding of national pride, work-home balance, reducing human impact on climate and the selfless dedication of health professionals. 
The pandemic’s chaos presented an opportunity to reevaluate priorities and develop new strategic solutions to the disruptions caused by tactical difficulties consequent to this plague. The interdependencies of our society, use of information technology and exceptional computational sciences, are the so-called new normal, the most appropriate way to do governance in an era of hyper connectedness. The pandemic has shown that economic and social determinants of ill-health are strong predictors of health outcome. There is a need to work for universal health coverage as it is in everyone’s interest that people who feel unwell should not check their pocket before they seek help. It is also imperative to  integrate community-led services into public systems so as to enable universal access, Free healthcare is not only vital for tackling pandemics but it also prevents millions of people from falling into extreme poverty by the cost of healthcare every year. One also needs to strengthen social safety nets to enhance resilience, given the interrelation between health and livelihoods. Lastly, developing a common culture that emphasizes personal responsibility in the public interest, is essential. It is important to underscore that the biggest steps forward in health have usually happened in response to a major crisis as raising of post-Second World War health systems across Europe or establishment of NHS in United Kingdom. 
Thus, coronavirus crisis, first and foremost a health crisis, has complex and long-term consequences. Policy preparedness, financing our health, and business leadership are key to resilience against such large systemic shocks. It can therefore be seen as an important opportunity for largescale, deep-seated structural change, far beyond the obvious, in scale and scope.

b162f9bcfc460d501aec2bf34a9dac13853b735f,Changes in the system of country’s population health care depending on the level of providing affordable housing,"This paper is devoted to providing affordable housing as a significant factor in public health management, inclusive growth, and SDG. The purpose is to empirically prove changes in the system of country’s population health care depending on the level of providing affordable housing. The empirical base includes time series and panel data for 27 EU countries during 2011–2019. Due to correlation analysis (Shapiro-Wilk testing, Spearman or Pearson correlation, lags in time), regression analysis, and building a dynamic panel estimation model with Sargan testing in STATA, the study empirically confirmed and formalized the impact of affordable housing funding on changes in the system of country’s population health care. In particular, the study found the dependence between overcrowding level and the share of homeowners with mortgages (a decrease of overcrowding level by an average of 0.61% with a time lag of 2 years due to an increase by 1%); the share of tenants on concessional terms/free (0.41% with a time lag of 3 years); and the share of public spending on housing development (0.25% with a time lag of 3 years). The direct relationship between the overcrowding and mortality from dangerous diseases (tuberculosis, AIDS, viral hepatitis, mental and behavioral disorders, diabetes, pneumonia) was also revealed. Public spending on housing under social protection programs (subsidies, etc.) proved to be the least effective. Preference should be given to the development of affordable mortgage lending (faster and greater effect). Generally, it impacts public management decisions in the health care system, social, and housing spheres.

8c9e79bede8f21d7ce1cf50bd23fb1dfbacab787,"Menstrual health interventions, schooling, and mental health problems among Ugandan students (MENISCUS): study protocol for a school-based cluster-randomised trial","Background Menstrual health is an increasingly recognised public health issue, defined as complete physical, mental, and social well-being in relation to the menstrual cycle. The MENISCUS trial aims to assess whether a multi-component intervention addressing physical and emotional aspects of menstrual health improves educational attainment, mental health problems, menstrual management, self-efficacy, and quality of life among girls in secondary school in Uganda. Methods The study is a parallel-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial with 60 schools (clusters) in Wakiso and Kalungu districts, with a mixed-methods process evaluation to assess intervention fidelity and acceptability and economic and policy analyses. The schools will be randomised 1:1 to immediate intervention or to optimised usual care with delayed intervention delivery. The intervention includes creation of a Menstrual Health Action Group at schools and NGO-led training of trainers on puberty education, development of a drama skit, delivery of a menstrual health kit including reusable pads and menstrual cups, access to pain management strategies including analgesics, and basic improvements to school water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. Baseline data will be collected from secondary 2 students in 2022 (median age ~15.5 years), with endline after 1 year of intervention delivery (~3600 females and a random sample of ~900 males). The primary outcomes assessed in girls are (i) examination performance based on the Mathematics, English, and Biology curriculum taught during the intervention delivery (independently assessed by the Uganda National Examinations Board) and (ii) mental health problems using the Total Difficulties Scale of the Strengths and Difficulties 25-item questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are menstrual knowledge and attitudes in girls and boys and, in girls only, menstrual practices, self-efficacy in managing menstruation, quality of life and happiness, prevalence of urogenital infections, school and class attendance using a self-completed menstrual daily diary, and confidence in maths and science. Discussion The trial is innovative in evaluating a multi-component school-based menstrual health intervention addressing both physical and emotional aspects of menstrual health and using a “training of trainers” model designed to be sustainable within schools. If found to be cost-effective and acceptable, the intervention will have the potential for national and regional scale-up. Trial registration ISRCTN 45461276 .

bcf3d89951789ff746115d777dfcf47933190c11,Reviving academic psychiatry in Australia and New Zealand,"Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 56(5) Fostering the next generation of academic psychiatrists is crucial to maintaining our leading role in providing evidence-based care for the patients we serve. Embedding academic psychiatry into clinical services ensures the development of cutting edge clinical evidence and rapid translation into clinical practice, thus improving clinical outcomes (Burke et al., 2018). There is much to be loved about a career in academic psychiatry: self-determinism in terms of time and following interests; opportunities to teach and mentor; being able to influence policy and practice; connecting and collaborating with colleagues; asking difficult questions and sometimes finding answers; and long-term job satisfaction. It is often said that clinicians burn out but academics never retire – this may in turn improve recruitment and retention, especially in the public mental health sector. Despite these benefits, fewer psychiatrists are taking this career pathway, and those that do face significant challenges. Husain (2021) has argued that there is a genuine existential threat to clinical scientists who are ‘under pressure either to voluntarily seek extinction or to evolve into a set of desktop scientists who don’t run experimental studies but rather analyse big data’. Husain worried that such a shift away from experimental studies would have significant deleterious consequences for discovery science (Husain, 2021). In the United States, while the current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical importance of clinical scientists, it has also brought the decline of this workforce due to constraints on reimbursement, time and funding into stark relief – the percentage of physicians engaged in research has declined from 4.75% in the 1980s to 1.5% today (Utz et al., 2022). In New Zealand and Australia, we do not have far to look for inspiration in academic psychiatry. John Cade was a psychiatrist who discovered lithium in a kitchen at Bundoora Repatriation Mental Hospital in Melbourne. Mason Durie is a leader of Māori health and research world-renowned for the promotion of Indigenous knowledge. Beverley Raphael’s mentorship inspired a generation of academic psychiatrists, demonstrating the importance of creating a stimulating and supportive environment to help grow a culture of lifelong learning. So how can we build and grow the next generation of clinical academics? Utz et al. (2022) proposed the multipronged strategy of: (1) providing an immersive research experience for medical trainees (e.g. funding for a gap year in research laboratory), (2) lowering financial barriers to academic careers, (3) restoring the educators and mentors in clinical science and (4) building a leak-free physician-scientist network. These approaches are in keeping with the call by Scott Henderson et al. (2015) from Australia and Richard Porter from New Zealand, along with 19 other senior academic psychiatrists across Australasia, for urgent actions to be taken. They suggested (1) the creation of adequately remunerated academic psychiatry pathways, (2) improved recruitment into psychiatry and increased opportunities to engage Reviving academic psychiatry in Australia and New Zealand",Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry (Print),2022.0,6,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221091927', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/00048674221091927?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221091927, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

aafb7a9ff39d271f724aeea17820615022b499be,Exploring the therapeutic mechanism of Baduanjin in the treatment of elderly stable angina pectoris based on the gut microbiota–lipid metabolism spectrum: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Importance Stable angina pectoris (SAP) often occurs in the elderly and is relatively stable for 1–3 months; however, if patients do not receive effective treatment, life-threatening acute myocardial infarction could occur. Patients with different clinical types of coronary heart disease have different intestinal flora. Baduanjin, a traditional Chinese Qigong, has been used as adjuvant therapy to improve the symptoms of patients with SAP. Objective To determine the effect of Baduanjin exercise on the symptoms of patients with SAP and the intestinal flora, explore the action links and targets of Baduanjin intervention in elderly patients with SAP, and explain its mechanism. Design A single-center, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. Setting The trial will be conducted at Guang'anmen Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Participants One hundred and eighty patients aged 60 to 80 years with stable angina pectoris (I–III) were intervened for 8 weeks and followed up for half a year. Interventions Among the screened patients, 180 patients will be randomly assigned to either the Baduanjin or the control group at a 1:1 ratio (exercise duration: for 3–5 times a week, for 8 weeks) of moderate-intensity Baduanjin or free activities. Main and secondary results The main result is the total effective rate for angina pectoris symptoms; secondary results include the duration of angina pectoris, number of angina pectoris episodes per week, nitroglycerin consumption, nitroglycerin reduction rate, Seattle angina score (SAQ), quality of life (SF-36),Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome scores, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, blood lipid serum hypersensitive C-reactive protein levels, intestinal flora changes, serum changes in the intestinal flora metabolite Trimetlylamine oxide (TMAO), and non-targeted liposome detection. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the experiment, and the data will be analyzed by researchers who did not know about the assignment. Discussion This study provides compelling evidence for at-home use of Baduanjin exercise to relieve SAP-associated symptoms.

It expands and accelerates the exchange of ideas and commodities over vast distances. Regional economies, societies, and cultures have become integrated through a global network of communications, transportation, and computer technology. These have given impetus and make the world more interdependent than ever (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization). Globalization is no longer about trade in things that can be put in a box, but about trade in everything that can be digitalized. Digital technology makes everything simple. A big problem appears in a trade is distance, but it can be solved by using computer and internet connection. Sale and purchase transaction can be done by using computer with the Internet connection. Computer gives important contribution in globalization. Hornby (1995: 235) states that computer is an electronic device for strong and analyzing information fed into it, for calculating, or for controlling machinery automatically. Computer is used in vary of field and computer also used in instruction. Computer used in instruction provides virtually instantaneous response to the students input, has extensive capacity to store and manipulate information, and is unmatched in its ability to serve many individual students simultaneously. It has the ability to control and integrate a wide variety of media – still pictures, graphics, and moving images, as well as printed information. The computer can also record, analyze, and react to students’ responses that are typed on a keyboard or selected with a mouse (Heinich, 1996: 228).",JUPE : Jurnal Pendidikan Mandala,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.58258/jupe.v8i1.4887', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.58258/jupe.v8i1.4887?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.58258/jupe.v8i1.4887, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This research takes the definition of creative learning from the theory of subjectivity, which is a strand of the cultural-historical approach. However, few studies have defined creativity in the field of computer science and even fewer have addressed learning in this field. This paper aims to diagnose creative learning in computer science in a computer engineering course at the University of Matanzas. In order to achieve this objective, creative learning is first established as an expression of creativity in learning. Then, it is described as a fundamental form of computer activity and, finally, creative learning in computer science is defined. A questionnaire was used to diagnose creative learning in computing. The questionnaire will be administered to 66 final year students enrolled in the academic year 2022. The indicators obtained in the theoretical section will be measured on a scale from 0 to 1. The study will first compare the data obtained through qualitative state inference, followed by the application of inferential statistical methods to further analyse the results. From the results, creative learning in computer science will be assessed and it will be found that it is generally poor. Based on the data, the hypothesis is rejected and the level of development of creative learning in computing is found to be low.

Campbell County that every Wyoming K-12 student has constitutional protection for a fair, complete, and equal education appropriate for the times. This protection results in the universal availability of a ""basket of goods,"" or a set of educational deliverables guaranteed to each student independent of the resources of individual school districts. In 2019, an executive action by Governor Matt Mead added to the deliverables ""the use and understanding of computer science."" His executive action initiated a system in which universal computer science became available to every Wyoming K-12 student by the 2022-2023 school year. The purpose of this paper is to use archival research methods through the lens of systems theory to explore the process of conceiving and implementing universal K-12 computer science education in Wyoming by considering the research question: How does systems theory provide a model for understanding Wyoming's universal K-12 computer science education delivery? Systems theory has been used to study organizational components and to analyze engineering systems since the 1950s, and a review of the literature indicates that many social systems can be understood through systems theory. However, using systems theory to study educational systems has not been studied in a comprehensive manner, resulting in a literature gap. This study analyzes how Wyoming's universal K-12 computer science delivery acts as a system.

decf539299a503f39dad4cc40c6fc8ae16f2b8a5,A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS WORLDWIDE OVER THE YEAR 2000-2022,"The emergence of new technologies such as AI, machine learning, and so on drives the discussion over human consciousness among researchers from various disciplines, particularly those from philosophy of mind and computer science. This is true since certain academic theories argue that new technology like this is much more efficient at simulating human tasks. This allows the discussion concerning human consciousness to acquire attention among researchers interested in learning more about human consciousness. As a result, this study gives a bibliometric analysis of human consciousness research from 2000 to 2022 to provide researchers and academics worldwide with an overview of the outcomes and trends in human consciousness research. A textual query on two databases; Scopus (1413 articles), and PubMed (258 papers) using the term “human consciousness” was conducted on 16 August 2022 collecting 1671 academic works from 2000 to 2022 relating to human consciousness research for in-depth study. Bibliometric analyses were performed using Rstudio software version 4.2.0 and biblioshiniy for bibliometrix to show and current of human consciousness research. This bibliometric study was examined the yearly scientific publishing growth, the most productive authors, most often term has been utilised, most renowned journal name, and which nations has maximum cooperation with other country. According to the findings of the study, there is significant inconsistency in worldwide patterns in yearly scientific output, with the number of publications growing and declining. Among all nations, United States of America (USA) published the most papers around human consciousness study. According to the research that has shown the most relevant contributors is Jun’ichi Takeno (Scopus), and Brian L Edlow (PubMed).

61c2eae0268cdb94e2541af69515ffe660eefbb9,SJMSS paper of the year 2022,"In 2021, the journal introduced a new “SJMSS Paper of the Year” award. This is decided by a panel comprising the Senior Section Editors of the journal and is awarded to a paper published in the calendar year 2022. The paper is selected on the basis of that which provides new and important insights in the field of sport and exercise science and medicine, coupled with a high level of scientific rigor. The recipient of the 2022 SJMSS Paper of the Year is Kujala et al.1 for their paper entitled: “Physical activity and health: Findings from Finnish monozygotic twin pairs discordant for physical activity.” This paper, which is a hybrid of a review and an original research paper, has investigated indices of health from monozygotic twin pairs extracted from two established Finnish twin cohorts. Seventeen twin pairs were selected as being uniquely discordant in regard to their levels of physical activity. The twin pairs underwent comprehensive examinations with the aim of investigating any differences in physical fitness, body composition, vascular and metabolic risk factors, muscle and adipose tissue gene expressions, artery diameters, bone structure, as well as in brain structure and function. The findings show that the twins with higher levels of longterm physical activity had higher VO2max, reduced body fat, reduced visceral fat, reduced liver fat, increased lumen diameters of conduit arteries to the lower limbs, increased bone mineral density in loaded bone areas, and an increased number of large highdensity lipoprotein particles. By controlling for genetics in this investigation through the use of identical twins, the study provides further compelling evidence of the efficacy of longterm physical activity on health across multiple systems. In addition to the wining paper from the Health, Disease and Physical Activity section, the following papers from the other sections of the journal were highly commended. In Physiology & Biochemistry, the paper by Filipas et al.2 investigated the effects of polarized or pyramidal periodizations during a 16week training period in 60 already welltrained endurance athletes. Polarized training occurs where individuals spend more time training at both a low intensity (below the first ventilatory threshold) and a high training intensity (above the second ventilatory threshold) relative to the intermediate zone (between these two thresholds). In contrast, pyramidal training is characterized by accumulating a higher percentage of training time in the lower and middle zones with less in the highest zone. This study showed that a modification of training intensity by changing from pyramidal to polarized in the second half of the periodization induced bigger improvements in physiological (VO2peak) and performance (5-km running time trial) measures compared with the simple pyramidal and polarized regimens, or when compared to switching from polarized into pyramidal periodization. In Biomechanics and Motor Control, the paper by Van Hooren et al.3 provided new insights into muscle fascicle behavior during three different hamstring exercises (Nordic hamstring curl, singleleg Roman chair, and singleleg deadlift), by integrating a combination of fullbody kinematics, ground reaction forces, surface muscle activation, and ultrasonography of the biceps femoris. In Sports Medicine & Orthopedics, the paper by Jansrud Hammer et al.4 used videorecorded laryngoscopy performed during maximal cardiopulmonary treadmill exercise to study exerciseinduced laryngeal obstruction in 100 national and international athletes. Exerciseinduced laryngeal obstruction is often confused with exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction, but they are very different. The results support the notion that persistent exerciserelated respiratory symptoms in athletes need careful diagnostic consideration to prevent indiscriminate use or escalation of asthma treatment. Finally, in Psychology of Sport, Exercise, and Health, the paper by Taylor et al.5 used an interesting psychophysiological model to examine disturbances in the desire to reduce effort and performance goal value across moderate, heavy, and severe exercise intensity domains. The results showed that progression from the moderate through to the heavy and severe domains of exercise are points in which motivational dynamics are perturbed, particularly the desire to reduce effort.

Since 2015, the American Delirium Society (ADS) Research Committee has conducted an annual survey of the delirium literature for presentation in its year-in-review session. Our objectives were to describe the review process used for the 2021-2022 and to summarise the selected publications.


Methods
Each member of the ADS Research Committee nominated up to 6 publications considered to be the most impactful primary delirium research published from September 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022. The 24 nominated studies were divided into three categories balanced by number of articles: medical intervention trials, non-medical intervention trials, and delirium detection/basic science studies. Each ADS Research Committee member ranked all studies in their assigned category for methodological rigor and for impact, each being scored as 0-10, for a total score of 0-20. It was decided a priori to select the top three highest-scoring articles in each category for presentation, with ties adjudicated by Committee consensus.


Results
Nineteen Research Committee members served as reviewers. Scores for each category were similar: medical interventions mean (standard deviation) 12.8 (1.1), non-medical interventions 13.1 (1.1), and detection/basic science 12.6 (1.0). We summarise the results of the papers presented in the 2022 ADS year-in-review session.


Conclusion
The diversity of studies presented for the 2022 ADS year-in-review session illustrates the breadth of the delirium field and the growing number of clinical trials. The dissemination of publications across a broad, diverse array of journals provides further justification of the need for delirium-specific journals.",Delirium communications,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://deliriumcommunicationsjournal.com/article/73356.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.56392/001c.73356?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.56392/001c.73356, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The reservoirs and vectors of Coxiella burnetii are ixodid ticks and their hosts. This disease is characterized by a variety of mechanisms and routes in humans and animals (e.g., vector-borne, foodborne, airborne, and dust-borne). The disease often runs in the form of a fever. This article will review the incidence of human Q fever on the Eurasian continent over the past 50 years. Because Q fever is one of the unobserved infectious diseases, the occurrence of Q fever in humans in most countries is impossible to evaluate. Since this literature review is the primary resource for tracking scientific trends and research findings on the subject, the main goal of this study has focused on estimating the index of the incidence of Q fever infection among humans and compiling a 50-year literature review from August 1973 to July 2022. This study investigated the articles published in PubMed, Scopus, CyberLink, Web of Science, and Google Scholar by reviewing the scientific literature and official systematic reviews. The data were obtained using the keywords “Q fever AND prevalence/incidence” and “Q fever AND epidemiology.” The incidence of Q fever varies considerably from country to country due to epidemiological differences and whether the disease is detectable or not. Depending on the location of the country, endemics or outbreaks occur. At the Third World Health Forum in 1950, the possible danger of Q fever to human health was realized, and decisions were made stimulating research into the global prevalence of the causative agent of the disease. Since then, numerous epidemiological studies have shown that Q fever occurs almost everywhere worldwide except in Antarctica and New Zealand. This review’s available literature and ongoing epidemiological investigations in many countries show that Q fever needs to be regarded as a global community health issue. However, in the case of Kazakhstan, there is currently no information on the incidence of infection in humans and farm animals that requires further research on the incidence of Q fever, especially in coronavirus disease 2019.",Archives of Clinical Infectious Diseases,2023.0,4,"{'url': 'https://brieflands.com/articles/archcid-136333.pdf', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5812/archcid-136333?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5812/archcid-136333, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1ce68c9dc7f81288b7d604ffdedaa03d663e831a,Refractory angina pectoris: a 20-year (2003–2022) bibliometric analysis,"Background The increasing number of patients with refractory angina pectoris, combined with the aging population and improved survival rates among coronary heart disease patients, presents a significant challenge in contemporary cardiovascular medicine. The treatment of refractory angina has been an ongoing area of exploration, yet a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature on this topic is currently lacking. Therefore, this study aims to provide the first bibliometric analysis of publications related to refractory angina. Methods A systematic search was conducted in the Web of Science database to identify articles related to refractory angina published between 2003 and 2022. The inclusion criteria were limited to articles and reviews written in English. CiteSpace software was utilized to conduct a collaborative network analysis of countries/regions, institutions and authors, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis of authors and references. Results A total of 1,386 publications were identified, with an annual publication volume exhibiting fluctuation over time. American and European countries and institutions demonstrated a leading position in terms of research output. Henry TD emerged as the most prolific researcher in the field, while Mannheimer C received the highest number of citations. The primary research hotspot within this field focused on the treatment of refractory angina, with recent emphasis on emerging treatments such as stem cell therapy and the coronary sinus reducer. A significant number of clinical trials have been conducted, with a continuous focus on patient benefits, quality of life, and survival prognosis. Conclusion Significant progress has been made in the field of refractory angina pectoris in recent years. Novel treatment methods, including spinal cord stimulation, enhanced external counterpulsation, stem cell therapy, and the coronary sinus reducer, hold promising therapeutic prospects. However, further high-quality evidence-based research is essential to support these emerging interventions.

Also, currently, Incurable Killer Diseases including the physical and neurological diseases of our times such as Brain, and Breast, and Lung Cancer [4–6] and Cardiovascular [7, 8], Asthma, HIV/AIDS, Dementia (e.g. Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntingdon’s and Vascular etc.), MS (Multiple Sclerosis), MD (Muscular Dystrophy), Motor Neuron Disorders such as ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease) to name a few among others, were of primary interest. These diseases’ cures as of yet non-existent, however, are still meticulously being sought by the world’s prominent institutes of epidemiologic and vaccination research centers such as CDC in USA. The goal of this Special Issue was what the ongoing global trends are, why and how to avoid the unprecedented misery triggered by diseases and disorders, and specifically, the current pandemics (SARS-CoV-2). The IJCTE has also fully encouraged scientific methodologies (via software) and technologies (via hardware) in the realm of medicinal sciences, and received original contributions such as Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Bacteriology, Genomics, Pulmonology, and Obstetrics [9], Clinical Psychology, Applied Mathematical and Statistical Sciences (Operations Research, Data Mining, Sampling, Hypothesis Testing, Estimation, Empirical Bayesian, Safety and Reliability, Game Theoretic and Neural Network and Machine and Deep Learning frameworks...) and Immunology and similar, whereas also in peripheral real disciplines addressing the core issue of Pandemics’ and Incurable Killer Diseases’ Disaster Recognition, Mobilization and Remediation and Immunization, and post COVID-19 Recalibration efforts [10] but not limited to all above options. Overall, the academic interest and eagerness toward this noble and global goal (while a relentless challenge has been announced by all nations during their SOTU-State of the Union and similar addresses at their own lands proper towards discovering vaccines to eradicate these disastrous pandemics and incurable killer diseases by the middle of the 21 century) have been phenomenal.

Materials and Methods Publications related to CBCT identified in the electronic collection of ISD were selected according to eligibility criteria by 2 independent reviewers who collected data on the characteristics of the articles (year, authors, and country). The type and topic of studies were analyzed using VOSviewer v.1.6.18 (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands). The research articles were classified according to the hierarchical scale of diagnostic efficacy. Results Of the 236 articles included, most were from South Korea and Brazil. Bong-Hae Cho and Yun-Hoa Jung were the most prolific authors on the topic of CBCT. The most frequently published types of studies were cross-sectional and laboratory-based. The most popular topics WERE related to the diagnosis of pathologies and/or alterations, as well as anatomical variations. On the diagnostic efficacy scale, most studies were rated level 1 (technical efficacy) or 2 (diagnostic accuracy efficacy). Conclusion A steady increase was observed in publications related to CBCT, which are of both clinical and academic interest. The trends in these publications were analyzed, revealing that most are cross-sectional studies primarily exploring the capabilities of CBCT in diagnosing pathologies and/or changes in the oral and maxillofacial complex. These studies were typically classified as level 1 or 2 on the diagnostic efficacy scale.",Imaging Science in Dentistry,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.5624/isd.20230106', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10761290, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Female genital mutilation causes short- and long-term complications like bleeding, pain, infection and exposes girls to sexually transmitted diseases. The determinants of female genital mutilation among children under the age of five have received less attention. As a result, the purpose of this study was to determine the factors that influence female genital mutilation in children under the age of five. Methods A community-based unmatched case control study design was used. The study participants were chosen using computer-generated simple random sampling technique. With a ratio of 1:4 between cases and controls, 323 participants were recruited. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The association between each independent variable and the dependent variable was determined using binary logistic regression. In a multivariable analysis, variables were considered statistically significant if they had a P-value of less than 0.05 at a 95% confidence interval. Results In this study, mothers’ circumcision status (AOR = 4.6; 95% CI: 2.29–9.25), mothers who had an unfavorable attitude (AOR = 4.15; 95% CI: 1.96–8.82), households in the poorest wealth quintile (AOR = 3.65; 95% CI: 1.2–11.54), mothers who had inadequate knowledge (AOR = 3.31; 95% CI: 1.51–7.25) and antenatal care visit of mothers (AOR = 2.46; 95% CI: 1.03–5.83) were found to be determinant factors of female genital mutilation. Conclusion and Recommendation Mothers’ circumcision status, mother’s attitude, wealth quintile, knowledge of mothers, and number of antenatal care visits were factors associated with female genital mutilation. Regular awareness-building on the impacts of the practice and special attention to the mother’s attitude are important to eliminate female genital mutilation.",International Journal of Women's Health,2023.0,5,"{'url': 'https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=88848', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10103778, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Accordingly, better understanding the underlying - possibly hidden - characteristics is one of the key challenges in air transport research. Network science has developed into a key domain for analyzing complex, inter-connected systems, with many studies having used network science techniques to dissect the universal patterns by the abstraction into a network-like structure. After more than two decades of aviation network analysis - the earliest influential papers date back to the early 2000s, providing a synopsis of the existing techniques and assessing the relevant characteristics on the global aviation system is judicious and helpful for the entire air transport community. In this study, we make three major contributions. First, we review the existing literature on complex network analysis of aviation system, having appeared in the past two decades, identifying key trends in the analysis and their results. Second, we provide a data-driven, network science-based analysis of the global aviation system and two of its variants for period from 2011 to 2022, leading to one of the most comprehensive studies in the literature. At the core of our analysis is the task of identifying node importance and answering the question how well complex network-based methods help to reveal the critical nodes in the system. Third, we derive a set of relevant research directions which we deem instrumental for advancing our understanding of global aviation and its subsystems through the lens of network science. We believe that our study provides a unique combination of biographical synopsis and data-driven analysis for the evolution of our global aviation system.",Journal of the Air Transport Research Society,2023.0,5,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.59521/5e2ddec9fad4593b?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.59521/5e2ddec9fad4593b, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Our journal has continued to expand its global reputation and broad readership over a tumultuous period of a global pandemic and diverse world conflicts as well as challenges. It is a true testament to the commitment of our journal and contributors to forge through in advancing science and surgical innovation during these times, with a direct consequence of this being an increasing recognition of our journal among the top tiered urological journals which is so very well depicted by our rapidly rising impact factor now benchmarked with many of the very best in our field. In making the selection of best videos of the year, several criteria have been employed including their surgical novelty and potential to improve patient care. These are clearly high bars set but truthfully I am thrilled to report that these challenging criteria have been achieved to a large extent by many of our published videos so all contributing authors of accepted videos over the past year are to be congratulated nevertheless there can only be a few select winners and on that note, I am pleased to announce that the first prize for best video of the year is awarded to the submission by Moschovas MC et al. entitled “Da Vinci SP radical prostatectomy: A multicentric collaboration and step-by-step techniques” published in the July-August issue (Vol 48(4):728-729) of our journal (1). The video provides a very practical approach to conducting minimally invasive radical prostatectomy using a single port platform as defined by some of the premier global surgical leaders in this milieu. The authors are applauded for sharing their wealth of knowledge and technical refinements in making this surgical approach highly accessible to many surgeons seeking to offer this surgical modality within their patient population. The second prize is awarded to Inzillo R et al. from the department of Urology from Guastalla Hospital from Emilia-Romagna, Italy for their video entitled “Percutaneous and endoscopic combined treatment of bladder and renal lithiasis in Mitrofanoff conduit” which was published in our May-June issue (Vol48(3)598-599) (2). As nicely detailed by the authors, the significant benefits to adopting a purely endoscopic management in managing bladder and renal calculi in patients with a Mitrofanoff conduit cannot be overemphasized.

Young adults are part of the most vulnerable population where it is essential to strengthen prevention, awareness and education actions. Objective: To describe the level of knowledge about sexually transmitted infections in first year medical students of the Universidad Abierta Interamericana - Sede Rosario, 2022.  Materials and methods: A quantitative, descriptive, observational, cross-sectional, prospective, quantitative study. Carried out at the Universidad Abierta Interamericana, Rosario campus. The population consisted of all 1st year students belonging to the School of Medicine and Health Sciences. The sampling was non-probabilistic by convenience. The data collection instrument consisted of an anonymous, voluntary and self-administered survey made up of 23 closed, multiple-choice questions with which the variables age, sex and level of knowledge were re-evaluated. The variables were analyzed through absolute and relative percentage frequencies and summarized through central position measures: mean, median and mode and dispersion measures: range and standard deviation. Results: A total of 178 students were surveyed, 100% of the students were in the 1st year of the course, with a mean age of 22.44 ± 4.40 years (min. 18; max. 48), of whom 116 (65%) were female and 62 (35%) were male. 97 (54%) students were not taking any STI-related subjects, 56 (32%) were taking one subject, 21 (12%) were taking two subjects and 4 (2%) were taking 4 subjects. The mean score was 13.64 ± 3.38 (min. 5; max. 20). 38% (67) of the students possessed a high level of knowledge about STIs, 40% (71) medium knowledge and 22% (40) low knowledge about STIs. Conclusions: Students have a medium-high level of knowledge about sexually transmitted infections in relation to definitions, forms of transmission and laboratory tests for the diagnosis of STIs and HIV.

In this study, we aimed to determine the site and histopathologic patterns of FGTB and its correlation with clinical presentation and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) status. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 122 patients with a histopathological diagnosis of FGTB at the Department of Pathology, College of Health Sciences (CHS), Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH), Addis Ababa University (AAU), from January 1, 2013, to August 30, 2022. Results Female genital tuberculosis was found in 0.94% of the gynecology specimens examined. The most common presentations were menstrual disturbance, abdominopelvic pain, and infertility. Among patients with FGTB, 4.6% exhibited misleading clinical and radiologic findings, leading to suspicion of malignancy and subsequent aggressive surgical management. The endometrium was the most frequently affected organ, followed by the fallopian tube, ovary, cervix, and vulva. In the majority of tuberculous endometritis cases (53.3%), histopathology revealed early-stage granulomas. Acid-fast bacilli were found in a significant proportion (42.6%) of FGTB tissues with TB histopathology. The ovary had the highest rate of AFB detection, followed by the fallopian tube, endometrium, and cervix. Conclusion Female genital tuberculosis should be considered in reproductive-age women presenting with menstrual irregularities, abdominopelvic pain, infertility, or an abdominopelvic mass.

Positive results achieved by a new editorial team in its first two years of stewardship of the journal [1] continued in 2022, as evidenced by numbers of article downloads and an impressive increase of 46% in journal impact factor. High-quality submissions continued to stream in from authors worldwide, resulting in a declining article acceptance rate to under 15%. Studies of obstructive airway disease comprised a significant portion of articles published is 2022. Clinical studies of COPD examined diagnosis [2], risk factors [3], predictors of outcomes [4–9], and therapeutic interventions [10, 11], whereas preclinical investigations evaluated chronic cigarette smoke-induced inflammation and airway remodeling [12, 13]. Contributions in the field of asthma included physiological studies [14–18], effects of therapeutic interventions [19], social determinants of clinical outcomes [20], asthmaassociated cough [21, 22] and preclinical investigations [23]. The journal was delighted to feature a number of investigations in the rapidly growing field of Interventional Pulmonology. Published studies evaluated transbronchial lung cryobiopsy [24, 25], endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)guided procedures [26–28] as well as novel robotic-assisted bronchoscopy and cryobiopsy [29, 30]. Lung cancer remains a major focus of investigation within the fields of pulmonary medicine and oncology. Relevant articles published in LUNG in 2022 reported on diagnostic markers [31], risk factors and prognosis [32–38], as well as medical [39] and surgical intervention [40]. Appropriate to their significance in pulmonary medicine, interstitial lung diseases (ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) were well represented in the journal. Studies of IPF investigated potential mechanisms [41], animal models of induced fibrosis [42], potential biomarkers [43] and clinical outcomes [44]. Contributions on the subject of ILD included evaluation of potential biomarkers [45], diagnostic cryobiopsy [24], pediatric ILD [46], ILD outcomes [47], as well as investigations of hypersensitivity pneumonitis [48] and bronchiectasis [49, 50]. In recent years, the study of cough has been among the most active areas of inquiry within pulmonary medicine. Indeed, 2022 witnessed the approval of the first-ever drug indicated for the treatment of refractory chronic cough [51, 52]. LUNG continued its emphasis on high-quality coughrelated research by featuring numerous articles, including those examining asthma-associated cough [21, 22]; cough associated with IPF [53] and COVID19 [54]; methodology of objective cough counting [55, 56]; cough-related healthcare utilization [57, 58]; physiology [59]; and, studies of potential antitussive drugs [60–62]. Among the goals of the journal in 2022 was to enhance content in preclinical and translational research. To that end, LUNG assigned a Deputy Editor for Basic Science Research to spearhead this effort going forward. Publications during the year included studies relevant to cigarette smoke-induced airway injury and COPD [12, 13]; asthma [23]; pulmonary fibrosis [42]; pulmonary hypertension [63]; sarcoidosis [64]; allergic airway inflammation [65]; immunity [66]; and, acute lung injury [67]. We remain eager to increase publication of high-quality manuscripts in the fields of Critical Care and Pediatric Pulmonology, and invite prospective authors to submit their work for consideration. Studies examining issues in critical illness included intravascular volume management in acute pulmonary embolism [68]; liver transplantation [69]; noninvasive ventilation [70, 71]; pulmonary effects of anesthesia [72]; and, a preclinical examination of acute lung injury [67]. Investigations of pediatric populations included topics such as management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia [73], interstitial lung disease [46] and asthma [17]. Pulmonary arterial hypertension continues to be an active focus of investigation within respiratory medicine.

So, of the 82 people who served as reviewers in the year of 2022 (all of which are listed in this issue on a standalone page of appreciation), we had one person who reviewed more submissions than anyone else and in the timeliest manner. Hence, this reviewer is being honoured with the Sexual and Relationship Therapy Reviewer of the Year Award. This reviewer is Mahbobeh Faramarzi, MD. of the Social Determinants of Health Research Center at Babol University of Medical Sciences in Babol, Iran. The work of this incredible reviewer was instrumental in the journal’s success this last year and for this we are grateful. Of the 32 scholarly articles published in print in the journal of Sexual and Relationship Therapy in 2022, seven were selected to be considered for this year’s Sexual and Relationship Therapy Best Article of the Year Award. These seven articles were chosen, because of all those articles published in print in 2022, these articles had the highest citation count, most views, most downloads, and/or highest Altmetric scores. Additional considerations in the selection of the articles to be considered for this award included the: timely nature of the content, overall quality of the writing and/or methodological approach, applicability and meaningfulness of the content to the field, the innovative nature of the contribution, and the promise to advance the field that is offered via the scholarship. The way the best article was then selected was by sharing the seven nominated articles with the SRT Editorial Board and Guest Editor/s for evaluation using a standardized evaluation form. If any perceived conflict of interest existed (e.g., the author was one of the people reviewing, or a close colleague, or a student), the Editorial Member with the conflict of interest did not evaluate that particular article. Each Editorial Member then forwarded their ratings to SRT Editorial Assistant, who then compiled the results. The results were then shared with the EIC, who then shared the results with the COSRT Training and Knowledge Manager. The award winners and honourable mentions were then informed of their recognition and now we are sharing the winners formally for the first time in this, the first issue of the year in 2023.",Sexual and Relationship Therapy,2023.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/14681994.2023.2190702?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/14681994.2023.2190702, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Compared to other health service provision mechanisms mobile health service has higher advantages in promoting a healthy lifestyle since it is not limited to time and space. Even though there are numerous studies conducted in the area of mobile health utilization, this phenomenon is not well studied among university students in Ethiopia, Hence this study aims to determine the level of mobile health applications utilization among health science students. Method A cross-sectional study was carried out at Debre Markos University from April 05 to June 25, 2022 among health science students. For this study, 423 students were recruited from health Science College using a systematic sampling method. The data was gathered using a self-administered questionnaire. Using SPSS version 26 software descriptive analysis, bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were performed. A P-value of .05 at a 95% confidence interval was considered statistically significant. The questionnaire’s validity was determined by expert opinion, and by calculating its reliability using cronbach alpha (α = .78). Result This study revealed that more than half 59% (144/244) of the study participants have installed and utilized 1–3 health-related apps. Among the students who have mobile health applications 38.6% utilize mobile health application several times a day while only 2.1% utilized rarely. Usage history shows that 40% of the study participants utilized the applications for a year, while 15.4% of the students utilized them for more than 2 years. Easiness of applications (AOR = 4.8, 95%CI: [2.1–11.2]), skill AOR = 4.2, 95%CI: [3.8–12]) and trust (AOR = 2.8, 95%CI: [1.6–4.8]) were among the factors that were associated with mobile health applications utilization. Students were asked about the barriers that limit the use mobile health applications and self-reported barriers includes Lack of knowledge and awareness of application benefits, and Lack of adequate time to use applications. Conclusion The study shows that mobile health applications utilization is moderate relative to previous studies. Mobile health application developers for the young generation should consider healthy lifestyle related applications like fitness and weight loss apps.",PLoS ONE,2023.0,3,"{'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275689&type=printable', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10343100, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As with previous events, this was an opportunity to gather the growing community of scholars dedicated to improving political science education. Democracy requires functioning institutions and an informed and engaged citizenry. As a community that values undergraduate education and wants to find innovative ways to better educate our students, our goal is to help them become better citizens by stressing the importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and civic engagement. The organization of the day-long conference reflects this spirit. The day was divided into a series of workshops (held in the morning) and panels (during the afternoon). The panels were organized around four tracks: 1) Promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the classroom; 2) Simulations and games; 3) Civic engagement; and 4) Teaching research, writing, and information literary. Summaries of each track’s discussions are provided below. The conference’s theme this year was “Teaching Political Science in a Post-Pandemic Era.” Our experiences in the classrooms during this past year and a half tell us that we are experiencing a new moment in undergraduate education. Students and faculty are facing new challenges related to diminishing resources, overwork, the physical and mental legacies of the pandemic, and the consequences of uneven online learning, among others. How to reconnect with our students—while we rethink and restructure our teaching in the post-pandemic era—is a central question we confront. Responding to our call for proposals, our workshops and panels approached this challenge from diverse and innovative perspectives to improve quantitative reasoning, problem-solving, critical and analytical thinking, communication skills, global/intercultural fluency, leadership and teamwork, and accessibility. All participants and presenters took care in engaging fruitfully and thoughtfully in the discussions throughout the day. The morning workshops discussed a range of issues central to the mission of teaching in a post-pandemic era, and we can only briefly note them here: how to facilitate equity and access in the classroom, the use of DiploSim in International Relations courses, how to create a safe and challenging learning environment, the role of Political Science Honor Societies in engaging students, the foundational principles of antiracist pedagogy, the design of role-playing simulations in remote and hybrid classrooms, how to engage students in local government, and how to teach experimental political science. We were extremely lucky to have Terri Givens, Professor of Political Science at McGill University, and the Founder of Brighter Professional Development, as the keynote speaker during luncheon.

We aim to estimate the global and regional prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in people aged 1 year or older from 2000 to 2022. Methods We systematically searched Web of Science, PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, Scopus, and Google databases on December 31, 2021, and updated them on August 20, 2022, without language and time restrictions. Meanwhile, we identified references of relevant system reviews and eligible articles and included the latest and unpublished data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2015–2016 and 2017–2018) database. The studies investigating the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in population-based studies were included. A standardized data extraction form was used to collect information from eligible studies. We used a random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the global and regional prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. We stratified meta-analyses by latitude, season, six WHO regions, the World Bank income groups, gender, and age groups. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021292586). Findings Out of 67,340 records searched, 308 studies with 7,947,359 participants from 81 countries were eligible for this study, 202 (7,634,261 participants), 284 (1,475,339 participants), and 165 (561,978 participants) studies for the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D <30, <50, and <75 nmol/L, respectively. We found that globally, 15.7% (95% CrI 13.7–17.8), 47.9% (95% CrI 44.9–50.9), and 76·6% (95% CrI 74.0–79.1) of participants had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30, 50, and 75 nmol/l, respectively; the prevalence slightly decreased from 2000–2010 to 2011–2022, but it was still at a high level; people living in high latitude areas had a higher prevalence; the prevalence in winter-spring was 1.7 (95% CrI 1.4–2.0) times that in summer-autumn; the Eastern Mediterranean region and Lower-middle-income countries had a higher prevalence; females were vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency; gender, sampling frame, detection assays, sampling region, time of data collection, season, and other factors contributed to heterogeneity between the included studies. Interpretation Globally, vitamin D deficiency remained prevalent from 2000 to 2022. The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency would increase the global burden of disease. Therefore, governments, policymakers, health workers, and individuals should attach importance to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and take its prevention as a public health priority.

These shifts have been marked not only in the domain of surgical methodology but also within the conceptual framework that governs the understanding, diagnosis, and management of the condition. This research endeavors to articulate the contemporary landscape of cataract surgery, delineating its chronological evolution, emergent trends, and intricate interconnections, spanning a period of four decades. The methodology employed a thorough exploration and meticulous analysis of the Web of Science (WoS) database, concentrating specifically on cataract-related research from 1983 to 2022. The corpus, comprising 9574 articles, underwent rigorous examination through bibliometric and science mapping instruments, including Bibliometrix, to assay the patterns, significant authorships, journal participations, and theoretical architecture in the field of cataract studies. The inquiry revealed a compounded annual growth rate of 3.82% in cataract research, with a mean citation index of 23.18 per article. This corpus encompasses contributions from 90 journals. This study was integral to the identification of seminal researchers, authoritative institutions, and cornerstone publications. The analysis was segmented into four analytical domains: an exploration of the fundamental structure of articles, an evaluation of author and journal participation, a scrutiny of keyword deployment, and an analysis of conceptual paradigms, uncovering substantial thematic interconnections and trends. This analytical endeavor systematically deconstructs the multifarious nature of cataract surgery and affiliated research, thereby unveiling a rich, multidimensional field that extends its influence and applicability beyond ophthalmology to a myriad of interdisciplinary pursuits. As an academic synthesis, the insights garnered from this study provide an unparalleled reference for scholars, clinical practitioners, and policymakers who have deeply invested in cataract surgery. This signifies the field's progressive evolution over an extended temporal frame and critically elucidates prospective avenues for scholarly inquiry and practical application, thereby fulfilling a vital niche in contemporary medical literature.",Medical Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.medicinescience.org/download/full_pdf?url=https://manage.effectpublishing.com/uploads/articles/cJyWdIEJsA8PtLmD3PRvZUZYKdBs9ZEawdLRKAxF.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5455/medscience.2023.10.211?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5455/medscience.2023.10.211, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

de81352789c75598a7d1d2ab5545e122e64de2cc,Predictive Analytics Model for Optimizing Carbon Footprint From Students’ Learning Activities in Computer Science-Related Majors,"Global warming poses a significant challenge to environmental sustainability due to the high greenhouse gas emissions originating from human activities. Among the various sectors contributing to these emissions, the education sector, particularly at the university level, plays a crucial role in generating carbon footprints. While several studies have examined carbon footprints within universities, few have focused on understanding the behavior and activities of individuals. Statistics show that students are the primary contributors to carbon emissions in higher education. Despite the availability of various methods for calculating carbon emissions, limited studies have utilized such data to predict future trends. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a predictive analytics model that leveraged students’ learning activities as a significant factor to predict future trends in university carbon emissions. Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) was used as a case study, especially computer science-related majors. The carbon emission calculation utilized a formula that incorporated various emission sources, including electricity, transportation, and paper consumption. In the 2022/2023 academic year, ITB generated 612.8 tons of CO $_{2}\text{e}$ . The prediction modeling employed the SVR algorithm and utilized historical data, such as carbon emissions from the last 30 days, and external information, such as weather, event-related data, and university data. The model’s performance was evaluated using metrics, yielding values of 129.41 for MAE, 158.03 for RMSE, 0.98 for R2, and 15.83 for MAPE.

7da93cec4f93271433b8096f5506adfe30c11962,Acceleration of the ocean warming from 1961 to 2022 unveiled by large-ensemble reanalyses,"The authors used a state-of-the-science ensemble ocean reconstruction to analyze ocean heat content evolution over the last 62 years, focusing on the analysis of warming acceleration and the main sources of its uncertainty. Long-term changes in ocean heat content (OHC) represent a fundamental global warming indicator and are mostly caused by anthropogenic climate-altering gas emissions. OHC increases heavily threaten the marine environment, therefore, reconstructing OHC before the well-instrumented period (i.e., before the Argo floats deployment in the mid-2000s) is crucial to understanding the multi-decadal climate change in the ocean. Here, we shed light on ocean warming and its uncertainty for the 1961-2022 period through a large ensemble reanalysis system that spans the major sources of uncertainties. Results indicate a 62-year warming of 0.43 ± 0.08 W m^−2, and a statistically significant acceleration rate equal to 0.15 ± 0.04 W m^−2 dec^−1, locally peaking at high latitudes. The 11.6% of the global ocean area reaches the maximum yearly OHC in 2022, almost doubling any previous year. At the regional scale, major OHC uncertainty is found in the Tropics; at the global scale, the uncertainty represents about 40% and 15% of the OHC variability, respectively before and after the mid-2000s. The uncertainty of regional trends is mostly affected by observation calibration (especially at high latitudes), and sea surface temperature data uncertainty (especially at low latitudes).",Nature Communications,2024.0,12,"{'url': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44749-7.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10791650, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8fa8bdee6e9420343cc9bbbb3aab4c7d8c57c93a,Addressing the PISA 2022 Results: A Call for Reinvigorating Indonesia's Education System,"The 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results depict a significant decline in the academic performance of Indonesian 15-year-olds in mathematics, reading, and science. The results position Indonesia's scores among the lowest since the country first participation in 2001. This editorial examines the implications of these results, drawing on data presented in PISA 2022, which illustrate the downward trend in performance and the widening gap between different socioeconomic groups. It argues for urgent educational reforms aimed at overhauling the current curricular frameworks, enhancing teacher training, and ensuring equitable educational opportunities. Specific strategies to achieve these goals include implementing the Merdeka Curriculum to promote student-centered learning, integrating educational neuroscience-based interventions to address learning disabilities, and leveraging intelligent tutoring systems and social media for collaborative learning. Additionally, developing localized assessments like the Indonesian Madrasah Competency Assessment and the Assessment of Indonesian Student Competence ensures alignment with international standards while addressing local needs. Through a comparative analysis with OECD averages and higher-performing nations, this piece highlights the necessity for Indonesia to adopt international best practices while tailoring them to local contexts. The ultimate goal is to equip Indonesian students with the skills necessary to meet both current and future challenges, thus improving their outcomes in subsequent PISA assessments and fostering national development.

e072a2c75f9dafdef267baf6e5a68aef598d1089,Cannabidiol use in France in 2022: Results from a nationwide representative sample of adults.,"INTRODUCTION
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-intoxicating cannabis compound found in diverse commercial products worldwide. However, its use may not be fully harmless. Accordingly, it is important to document the prevalence of CBD use and user characteristics in the general population.


METHODS
We conducted a nationwide survey from a random sample of adults living in France using computer-assisted telephone interviews between 2 March and 9 July 2022. We estimated the prevalence of CBD awareness and CBD use, and explored the different routes of administration. We also performed logistic regression models to identify factors associated with past-year CBD use.


RESULTS
Based on data from 3229 participants, we estimated that 71.0% (95% confidence interval) (69.0-73.0) of the French adult population had heard of CBD, and 10.1% (8.7-11.4) had used it in the previous year. Past-year CBD use was associated with younger age, a higher educational level, not living in a middle-sized urban unit, tobacco consumption and e-cigarette use. The most common route of administration was smoking (56.1%).


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Past-year CBD use prevalence in France appeared to be as high as that for cannabis. Proper prevention, regulation and control of CBD products is necessary to ensure that people have access to safe and high-quality products. Reliable information on CBD should be sought and disseminated, especially regarding the harms associated with smoking the compound.",Drug and Alcohol Review,2024.0,2,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/dar.13842', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/dar.13842?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13842, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d0c40805ff8a219816bbb9396911b30ecf7ad464,Bibliometric and visual analysis of single-cell sequencing from 2010 to 2022,"Background: Single-cell sequencing (SCS) is a technique used to analyze the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and other genetic data at the level of a single cell. The procedure is commonly utilized in multiple fields, including neurobiology, immunology, and microbiology, and has emerged as a key focus of life science research. However, a thorough and impartial analysis of the existing state and trends of SCS-related research is lacking. The current study aimed to map the development trends of studies on SCS during the years 2010–2022 through bibliometric software. Methods: Pertinent papers on SCS from 2010 to 2022 were obtained using the Web of Science Core Collection. Research categories, nations/institutions, authors/co-cited authors, journals/co-cited journals, co-cited references, and keywords were analyzed using VOSviewer, the R package “bibliometric”, and CiteSpace. Results: The bibliometric analysis included 9,929 papers published between 2010 and 2022, and showed a consistent increase in the quantity of papers each year. The United States was the source of the highest quantity of articles and citations in this field. The majority of articles were published in the periodical Nature Communications. Butler A was the most frequently quoted author on this topic, and his article “Integrating single-cell transcriptome data across diverse conditions, technologies, and species” has received numerous citations to date. The literature and keyword analysis showed that studies involving single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were prominent in this discipline during the study period. Conclusion: This study utilized bibliometric techniques to visualize research in SCS-related domains, which facilitated the identification of emerging patterns and future directions in the field.

b992032d8fe79a4ec3c221308cf2815a9403e27d,Worldwide trends in prediabetes from 1985 to 2022: A bibliometric analysis using bibliometrix R-tool,"Background Prediabetes is a widespread condition that represents the state between normal serum glucose and diabetes. Older individuals and individuals with obesity experience a higher rate of prediabetes. Prediabetes is not only a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) but is also closely related to microvascular and macrovascular complications. Despite its importance, a bibliometric analysis of prediabetes is missing. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive and visually appealing overview of prediabetes research. Methods First, the Web of Science (WOS) database was searched to collect all articles related to prediabetes that were published from 1985 to 2022. Second, R language was used to analyze the year of publication, author, country/region, institution, keywords, and citations. Finally, network analysis was conducted using the R package bibliometrix to evaluate the hotspots and development trends of prediabetes. Results A total of 9,714 research articles published from 1985 to 2022 were retrieved from WOS. The number of articles showed sustained growth. Rathmann W was the most prolific author with 71 articles. Diabetes Care was the journal that published the highest number of articles on prediabetes (234 articles), and Harvard University (290 articles) was the most active institution in this field. The United States contributed the most articles (2,962 articles), followed by China (893 articles). The top five clusters of the keyword co-appearance network were “prediabetes”, “diabetes mellitus”, “glucose”, “insulin exercise”, and “oxidative stress”. The top three clusters of the reference co-citation network were “Knowler. WC 2002”, “Tabak AG 2012”, and “Matthews DR1985”. Conclusions The combined use of WOS and the R package bibliometrix enabled a robust bibliometric analysis of prediabetes papers, including evaluation of emerging trends, hotspots, and collaboration. This study also allowed us to validate our methodology, which can be used to better understand the field of prediabetes and promote international collaboration.",Frontiers in Public Health,2023.0,23,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1072521/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9993478, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A secondary aim was to provide a worked example of a scientifically valid translation process. Methods A four-step process was applied: (1) forward translation, (2) backward translation, (3) quantitative validation (two back-translated English versions vs. original English version), and (4) qualitative validation (one Dutch version vs. original English version), resulting in the final Dutch CHEERS II checklist. Results During quantitative validation, the average scores indicated high language comparability (1.88 (SD 0.70); 1.70 (SD 0.73)) and interpretation similarity (1.77 (SD 0.81); 1.54 (SD 0.74)). Four items required formal revision. In the qualitative validation step, feedback primarily focused on specific terms ‘outcomes,’ ‘benefits and harms,’ ‘(year of) conversion,’ ‘any,’ and ‘characterizing.’ Conclusion Despite English being the common language of science, translating research instruments remains relevant to enhance clarity, accessibility, and inclusivity. The Dutch translation can be used by students, regulators, researchers, or others to report and evaluate reporting of economic evaluations.

Previous studies primarily focused on exploring specific toxicities within CHM, without providing an overview of CHM’s toxicity. The absence of a quantitative assessment of focal points renders the future research trajectory ambiguous. Therefore, this study aimed to reveal research trends and areas of concern for the past decade. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on publications related to CHM and toxicity over the past decade from Web of Science Core Collection database. The characteristics of the publication included publication year, journal, institution, funding, keywords, and citation counts were recorded. Co-occurrence analysis and trend topic analysis based on bibliometric analysis were conducted on keywords and citations. Results: A total of 3,225 publications were analyzed. Number of annal publications increased over the years, with the highest number observed in 2022 (n = 475). The Journal of Ethnopharmacology published the most publications (n = 425). The most frequently used toxicity classifications in keywords were hepatotoxicity (n = 119) or drug-induced liver injury (n = 48), and nephrotoxicity (n = 40). Co-occurrence analysis revealed relatively loose connections between CHM and toxicity, and their derivatives. Keywords emerging from trend topic analysis for the past 3 years (2019–2022) included ferroptosis, NLRP3 inflammasome, machine learning, network pharmacology, traditional uses, and pharmacology. Conclusion: Concerns about the toxicity of CHM have increased in the past decade. However, there remains insufficient studies that directly explore the intersection of CHM and toxicity. Hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, as the most concerned toxicity classifications associated with CHM, warrant more in-depth investigations. Apoptosis was the most concerned toxicological mechanism. As a recent increase in attention, exploring the mechanisms of ferroptosis in nephrotoxicity and NLRP3 inflammasome in hepatotoxicity could provide valuable insights. Machine learning and network pharmacology are potential methods for future studies.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,2024.0,6,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1293468/pdf?isPublishedV2=False', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10867220, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, there is no comprehensive analysis available on PCI-related studies published in the literature. This study aimed to analyze and visualize the changes of scientific output regarding prognosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) after PCI over the past 20 years and to reveal the knowledge domain and development trends in this field by using CiteSpace software. Methods Relevant articles published over the period 2004–2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. After manual selection, qualified documents were included and recorded with the information of their title, abstract, keyword, author, descriptor, citation, identifier, publishing year and publishing organization. We transferred the data to CiteSpace V5.8.R2 (Version 5.8.R2) to draw knowledge maps and to conduct co-occurrence analysis, cluster analysis, timeline analysis, burst term detection and citation analysis. Results A total of 14,699 literature records were found relating prognosis of CHD after PCI in the past 20 years (2004–2022), including 14,212 original articles and reviews, and they were published in 153 different journals. Publication production has increased annually and a total of 1182 authors, 796 institutes and 147 countries have contributed to these publications. Moreover, the most representative author was Gregg W Stone from the CardioVascular Research Foundation (CVRF) with 368 publications, whose team mainly focused on exploring the efficacy and safety of revascularization and the characteristics of susceptible population. The global productivity ranking was led by the USA with 3326 published papers, followed by Italy (n = 1355), Japan (n = 1080), China (n = 1075) and Germany (n = 937). And the keywords of these publications were “percutaneous coronary intervention” (n = 2271), “outcome” (n = 1756), “mortality” (n = 1730) and “impact” (n = 1334). Other commonly-used words were “predictor” (n = 1324), “intervention” (n = 1310), “angioplasty” (n = 1299), “risk” (n = 1144), “acute myocardial infarction” (n = 1136) and “artery disease” (n = 1098). Cluster analysis showed that 15 high connected clusters were generated with a modularity Q of 0.831 and a weighted mean silhouette of 0.9388 by applying the log-likelihood ratio algorithm, and the top 5 clusters were #0 optical coherence tomography, #1 dual antiplatelet therapy, #2 bleeding, #3 clopidogrel and #4 thrombus aspiration. Furthermore, the frontiers in the field of prognosis of CHD after PCI mainly involved “decision making”, “reperfusion”, “angioplasty”, “balloon”, “unstable angina”, “dual antiplatelet therapy”, “cardiac surgical score”, “restenosis”, “reperfusion”, “thrombolytic therapy”, etc. Conclusions To sum up, efficacy and safety of different types of stents, the risk factors of restenosis and thrombotic events after PCI, early risk assessment, and secondary prevention and complications of patients with CHD after PCI were research hotspots and frontier topics in the area by bibliometric analysis. The results could provide a comprehensive overview of the research hotspots and frontier topics relating prognosis of CHD after PCI, promoting a better understanding of the knowledge domain and development trends in this field during the past 20 years.",European Journal of Medical Research,2023.0,14,"{'url': 'https://eurjmedres.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40001-023-01220-5', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10472664, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Nonetheless, publication trends and research hotspots in this field remain unknown. The study aimed to perform a bibliometric analysis to systematically identify publication trends and research hotspots in the field of gut microbiota and lung cancer research within a 12-year panorama. Methods Publications related to the gut microbiota and lung cancer between 1 January 2011 and 25 October 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The online analytic tool of the WoSCC was used to analyze various bibliometric parameters. The bibliometrics website, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer were used to identify research trends and hotspots. Results A total of 375 publications related to the gut microbiota and lung cancer were extracted from WoSCC and identified for analysis. The number of annual publications has grown rapidly since 2018 and reached a peak in 2022. China was the most prolific country in this field, with 120 publications, followed by the United States (114), with the highest H-index of 31. Additionally, France ranked the highest with an average of 133 citations, while the leading institution and journal were the Unicancer and the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, respectively. Interestingly, Routy Bertrand was the most prolific author and also the most cited author in terms of H-index and citations. Reference and keyword burst detection indicated that the research hotspots mainly included 1) the gut microbiota directly affects the efficacy of immunotherapy for lung cancer, 2) the application of different gut bacteria on lung cancer, and 3) the mechanism of the gut microbiota on lung cancer. Conclusion The findings of this study revealed the general publication trends and evolving research hotspots in the field of gut microbiota and lung cancer at a global level. The research hotspots focused on the clinical application of the gut microbiota combined with immunotherapy in lung cancer and its mechanism.

5bb727f61796f0b24426c7a5d9e38aec6c4f147c,VisDA 2022 Challenge: Domain Adaptation for Industrial Waste Sorting,"Label-efficient and reliable semantic segmentation is essential for many real-life applications, especially for industrial settings with high visual diversity, such as waste sorting. In industrial waste sorting, one of the biggest challenges is the extreme diversity of the input stream depending on factors like the location of the sorting facility, the equipment available in the facility, and the time of year, all of which significantly impact the composition and visual appearance of the waste stream. These changes in the data are called ``visual domains'', and label-efficient adaptation of models to such domains is needed for successful semantic segmentation of industrial waste. To test the abilities of computer vision models on this task, we present the VisDA 2022 Challenge on Domain Adaptation for Industrial Waste Sorting. Our challenge incorporates a fully-annotated waste sorting dataset, ZeroWaste, collected from two real material recovery facilities in different locations and seasons, as well as a novel procedurally generated synthetic waste sorting dataset, SynthWaste. In this competition, we aim to answer two questions: 1) can we leverage domain adaptation techniques to minimize the domain gap? and 2) can synthetic data augmentation improve performance on this task and help adapt to changing data distributions? The results of the competition show that industrial waste detection poses a real domain adaptation problem, that domain generalization techniques such as augmentations, ensembling, etc., improve the overall performance on the unlabeled target domain examples, and that leveraging synthetic data effectively remains an open problem.

Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic bone metabolism disorder in which the immune system and bone metabolism interact.


OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to explore the research status, hot spots and trends regarding the influence of the immune system on OP and to provide a basis for research directions and applications in this field.


METHODS
We searched and collected literature about the immune system and OP published from 2012 to 2022 in the Web of Science Core Collection database. All the included studies were subjected to bibliometrics analysis using Hiplot Pro, VOSviewer and CiteSpace software to produce statistics and visual analyses of the literature output, countries, institutions, authors, keywords and journals.


RESULTS
A total of 1201 papers were included, and the number of citations of these articles reached 31,776. The number of publications and citations on the immune system and OP has increased year by year. The top three countries with the greatest number of papers published were China, the United States of America (USA) and Italy. The two institutions with the largest number of papers published were Sichuan University and Soochow University, both located in China. De Martinis Massimo (Italy) and Ginaldi Lia (Italy) are prolific authors in this field. The representative academic journals are Osteoporosis International, Frontiers in Immunology, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, PloS One and Bone. The results of the keyword cooccurrence analysis showed that the research topics in this field mainly focused on T cells, cytokines, signaling pathways, vitamin D, postmenopausal OP and immune diseases.

b519d51bd7578efacdf46d03901f8e6fd3a729aa,Global research trends and hot spots on autophagy and kidney diseases: a bibliometric analysis from 2000 to 2022,"Background: Autophagy is an essential cellular process involving the self-degradation and recycling of organelles, proteins, and cellular debris. Recent research has shown that autophagy plays a significant role in the occurrence and development of kidney diseases. However, there is a lack of bibliometric analysis regarding the relationship between autophagy and kidney diseases. Methods: A bibliometric analysis was conducted by searching for literature related to autophagy and kidney diseases in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database from 2000 to 2022. Data processing was carried out using R package “Bibliometrix”, VOSviewers, and CiteSpace. Results: A total of 4,579 articles related to autophagy and kidney diseases were collected from various countries. China and the United States were the main countries contributing to the publications. The number of publications in this field showed a year-on-year increasing trend, with open-access journals playing a major role in driving the literature output. Nanjing Medical University in China, Osaka University in Japan, and the University of Pittsburgh in the United States were the main research institutions. The journal “International journal of molecular sciences” had the highest number of publications, while “Autophagy” was the most influential journal in the field. These articles were authored by 18,583 individuals, with Dong, Zheng; Koya, Daisuke; and Kume, Shinji being the most prolific authors, and Dong, Zheng being the most frequently co-cited author. Research on autophagy mainly focused on diabetic kidney diseases, acute kidney injury, and chronic kidney disease. “Autophagy”, “apoptosis”, and “oxidative stress” were the primary research hotspots. Topics such as “diabetic kidney diseases”, “sepsis”, “ferroptosis”, “nrf2”, “hypertension” and “pi3k” may represent potential future development trends.

75a9bdadc316831c562ab26c4c0b4391f0eb141e,A review of foodborne Toxoplasma gondii with a special focus on its prevalence in Pakistan from 2000 to 2022,"Third-world countries have a higher prevalence of food-related disorders than developed nations. Millions of people in underdeveloped countries are seriously at risk from the potential water supply contamination with protozoan diseases. Toxoplasma gondii is one of the important protozoans causing diseases in livestock and humans. Despite the standard tests for diagnosing this parasite and different treatment methods, the spread of these parasites is uncontrollable and rising every year due to other management disorders. In this review, we summarize etiopathogenesis and prevalence in Pakistan. We looked for papers reporting the seroprevalence of T. gondii in people and animals between 2000 and 2022 in different databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science. Data on the seroprevalence of T. gondii in Pakistan's domestic animals (sheep and goats, horses, donkeys, mules, cattle, and buffaloes), domestic pets (cats and dogs), poultry and rodents, and humans were gathered. According to the findings, sheep had an estimated pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii that varied from 11.20 to 26.50 %, and goats from 24.50 to 38.40%. Whereas in buffalo the opposite trend was followed, and the prevalence was observed is 0% in 2022, in horses, donkeys, and mules, only one study was reported according to which a high prevalence was observed in mules (28.60%) followed by donkeys (23.50%) and horses (23.50%), in cats 38.5% prevalence was observed in a recent study and in dogs 28.43% observed, and in humans from 22 to 60%. Human beings are found to be the most affected species showing high prevalence among all. According to our findings, animals and pets not only serve as a reservoir for the parasite but also serve as a direct route for human infection with T. gondii. The diagnostic techniques used in the observed studies were mostly serological testing whereas only a few studies have only been observed with molecular testing. To know the exact pattern of the disease for its control, the trend of molecular and advanced testing should be adopted as it is more reliable. Moreover, to decrease the transmission chances of T. gondii to humans, it is crucial to manage T. gondii infections in non-human species.",Frontiers in Veterinary Science,2023.0,4,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.1080139/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9890071, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These plaques narrow the lumen of the coronary artery, leading to episodic or persistent angina. Atherosclerosis is not just a lipid deposition disease but an inflammatory process with a high-specificity cellular and molecular response. Anti-inflammatory treatment for CHD is a promising therapy; several recent clinical studies (CANTOS, COCOLT, and LoDoCo2) provide therapeutic directions. However, bibliometric analysis data on anti-inflammatory conditions in CHD are lacking. This study aims to provide a comprehensive visual perspective on the anti-inflammatory research in CHD and will contribute to further research.

An empirical study,"Summary Aim To assess the quality of reporting of Scoping Reviews (ScRs) in Orthodontics according to the PRISMA Extension Checklist for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Our secondary aim was to identify publication characteristics, such as year of publication, journal, inclusion of a reporting guideline, and study registration, associated with ScRs reporting quality. Materials and Methods Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched as of 1 August 2022 for identification of orthodontic ScRs. This was supplemented by electronic searches within the contents of eleven specialty journals. The item-specific and overall reporting quality score of the examined orthodontic ScRs, based on the PRISMA Extension Checklist for Scoping Reviews were recorded. Association of reporting quality score with publication characteristics was further examined. Results A total of 40 ScRs were identified and included, with a mean reporting quality score of 73.0 per cent (standard deviation = 14). The majority of studies were published from 2020 onwards (32/40; 80.0%). Of the most adequately reported items were the summary of the evidence description in the Discussion (38/40; 95.0%) and the selection of the sources of evidence in the Results section (34/40; 85.0%). Protocol registration and reporting of limitations were missed in almost half of the ScRs (19/40; 47.5%), while less than half studies were adequately justified (18/40; 45.0%). According to the multivariable linear regression, adherence to appropriate reporting guidelines resulted in improved reporting quality score by 10 per cent (β-coefficient: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.19; P = 0.04), conditional on year and journal of publication.

Methods: From the China Knowledge Network database, we set the time period from 1 January 2001 to 31 October 2022 and the Chinese journal literature funded by NSFC projects. The association between the authors of the papers was analyzed using VOSviewer1.6.18. Moreover, CiteSpace6.1.R3 was used to visualize the paper's institutional collaboration, the keywords and the timeline of the papers. Results: It revealed that a few teams, including Tong Yigang, Zhou Yusen, Yang Ruifu and Cao Wuchun as the core, were involved in the NSFC-funded biosafety field. The State Key Laboratory of Biosafety of Pathogenic Microorganisms was the main institutional undertaking unit, and inter-institutional collaboration was more dispersed. Research frontiers are focused on the prevention and management of major emerging and emergent infectious diseases, biotechnology development, application, identification, evaluation and management of unknown risks, etc. Conclusion: From year 2000 to year 2022, the biosafety field focused on funding infectious diseases and epidemiology, and the research direction concentrated on the hot events of society, the development trend of science and technology and national strategic needs. However, there was a trend toward financing being excessively focused in a small number of units and teams and away from the field of microbial drug resistance.

fd53584814bdd286ef76208dffb9e5e9a9686ad4,ICPE 2022 Special Issue (Part 4) Editorial,"The International Conference on Physics Education 2022 was themed ""Physics Education: Preparing for the Future."" This special issue, contains six articles elaborating on presentations from the conference. What they share is the introduction of new methods and didactic approaches in the field of physics education, along with corresponding studies.

In ""The Use of Analogies by Future Physics Teachers in Conducting Supervised Internship Activities,"" F.W. Parma, M.H.A. Vieira, and R. Nardi aimed to investigate how future physics teachers employed analogies during a supervised internship.
Shintsuruta, T. Iwayama, and H. Okubo provide an exciting insight into physics education research (PER) in the field of electricity. In Japan, the shape dependence of electrical resistance is effectively taught in senior high schools. The authors present design and practice lessons that illustrate and help students understand the concept.
Escape rooms are playing an increasingly important role as a leisure activity for teenagers (and adults). T. Sukelová and K. Velmovská address the motivational aspect of escape rooms and integrate it into the learning of physics. Their article impressively demonstrates that a forward-looking physics education must explore new paths to be both engaging and effective!
""A Study of Grade Eleven Students’ Representations of Electricity Through Model-Based Inquiry"" by W. Boonmak and J. Huntula arises from the conditions prevailing during COVID-19. The pandemic forced schools to close and transition to online learning. The authors from Thailand researched whether students achieve a higher level of representation after learning via an online learning platform through the Model-Based Inquiry (MBI) method and how they can be supported. In the context of physics, this study once again pertains to the topic area of electricity.
Physics education takes place all over the world. Thus, ""The Use of Research Findings by Undergraduate Physics Education Programs in Angola"" enriches the previously presented studies with insights from Africa. The authors, J. Oliveira and R. Nardi, present the findings of a pilot study that aimed to determine whether scholarly literature—such as journal articles, monographs, dissertations, and theses—is considered in the education of physics teachers in Angola.
Finally, E. Blanquet and D. Hennequin from France present ""Identifying First-Year Science Students’ Difficulties: Results From The Online French Physical Society Questionnaire,"" a large-scale study involving 5,891 first-year science students from various French tertiary education tracks (universities, preparatory classes for engineering schools, technological university institutes, etc.) conducted over nine years. The goal was to document the understanding of physics concepts and the mastery of basic mathematical tools after completion of the baccalauréat (French high school exit examination).

The articles vividly demonstrate how new paths are being pursued internationally to modernize, enhance, and future-proof the teaching and learning of physics. They also highlight the necessity of physics education research to make informed statements about the effectiveness of these new approaches.
I would like to thank all the authors and their teams for their inspiring insights into new paths and scientific investigations.

247b4a4187a07c922da00e712bbf3d1979bbb61e,Trends and patterns in blended learning research (1965–2022),"Blended learning (BL) applications, which are defined as a combination of online and face-to-face education processes and created with the strongest aspects of various teaching approaches, have attracted increasing attention particularly in recent years with the effect of the pandemic. Although blended learning studies, which have a wide range of content and variety of applications in the literature, have been examined by content analysis in many scientific studies, bibliometric studies that provide a comprehensive review of studies on BL and reveal a general map of scientific studies are extremely limited. The purpose of this research is to conduct a systematic analysis of BL studies around the world and to reveal general research trends by bibliometric method. In the scope of the research, 4,059 publications searched in the Scopus database between the years 1965—2022 were analyzed by VOSviewer and Leximancer software; the publications were examined from aspects such as year, subject, fund, citation, journal, country, common word, etc. An analysis of the research results reveals that studies on BL have increased in number in the literature since 2006; it has been found that the fields of social sciences, computer, medicine and engineering come to the forefront in the categorization of publications by subject, and the USA, UK, China and Australia are the most cited countries. As revealed by the findings of common word analysis, the studies mostly focus on the use of technology during the pandemic, current trends in education and technology, online learning environment and learner characteristics, teaching approaches, social media, motivation and medical education.

ac9af6ceee7e5cee86c8a1452f568e44d1067459,"A global long-term, high-resolution satellite radar backscatter data record (1992–2022+): merging C-band ERS/ASCAT and Ku-band QSCAT","Abstract. Satellite radar backscatter contains unique information on land surface moisture, vegetation features, and surface roughness and has thus been used in a range of Earth science disciplines. However, there is no single global radar data set that has a relatively long wavelength and a decades-long time span. We here provide the first long-term (since 1992), high-resolution (∼8.9 km instead of the commonly used ∼25 km resolution) monthly satellite radar backscatter data set over global land areas, called the long-term, high-resolution scatterometer (LHScat) data set, by fusing signals from the European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS; 1992–2001; C-band; 5.3 GHz), Quick Scatterometer (QSCAT, 1999–2009; Ku-band; 13.4 GHz), and the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT; since 2007; C-band; 5.255 GHz). The 6-year data gap between C-band ERS and ASCAT was filled by modelling a substitute C-band signal during 1999–2009 from Ku-band QSCAT signals and climatic information. To this end, we first rescaled the signals from different sensors, pixel by pixel. We then corrected the monthly signal differences between the C-band and the scaled Ku-band signals by modelling the signal differences from climatic variables (i.e. monthly precipitation, skin temperature, and snow depth) using decision tree regression. The quality of the merged radar signal was assessed by computing the Pearson r, root mean square error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (rRMSE) between the C-band and the corrected Ku-band signals in the overlapping years (1999–2001 and 2007–2009). We obtained high Pearson r values and low RMSE values at both the regional (r≥0.92, RMSE ≤ 0.11 dB, and rRMSE ≤ 0.38) and pixel levels (median r across pixels ≥ 0.64, median RMSE ≤ 0.34 dB, and median rRMSE ≤ 0.88), suggesting high accuracy for the data-merging procedure. The merged radar signals were then validated against the European Space Agency (ESA) ERS-2 data, which provide observations for a subset of global pixels until 2011, even after the failure of on-board gyroscopes in 2001. We found highly concordant monthly dynamics between the merged radar signals and the ESA ERS-2 signals, with regional Pearson r values ranging from 0.79 to 0.98. These results showed that our merged radar data have a consistent C-band signal dynamic. The LHScat data set (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20407857; Tao et al., 2023) is expected to advance our understanding of the long-term changes in, e.g., global vegetation and soil moisture with a high spatial resolution. The data set will be updated on a regular basis to include the latest images acquired by ASCAT and to include even higher spatial and temporal resolutions.

The key strength of LASA is our members, therefore getting back to meeting in person was very welcome. The meeting in Birmingham, UK was over two days; a revised arrangement to support a smooth and safe transition from the online format. An engaging scientific, trade and social programme was put together through LASA Council, section convenors and generous contributions following an open call to junior researchers. The meeting focused on discussing new scientific developments in laboratory animal sciences, animal welfare and, importantly, how our community can continue to promote further development in the 3Rs. Our keynote speakers delivered masterclass lectures on two key areas of science: Andreas Schaefer (Francis Crick Institute) explained how neurotechnology is helping to unravel the function of sensory circuits in the mouse brain, and Rudolf de Wildt (GlaxoSmithKline), discussed the ‘Past – present – future of antibody discovery’. These talks disseminated how excellence, innovation and multidisciplinary preclinical animal research is currently supporting biomedical discovery and translational research, and additionally how this work is supporting further developments in 3Rs and alternative approaches. It is hugely important for the LASA community to continue engaging with such innovative research alongside the association’s commitment to ensure and promote best animal use, care and welfare. In the Animal Care & Welfare session, there were extremely well-received talks on ‘Home cage monitoring of mouse behaviours’ by Sonia Bains (MRC Harwell, UK), ‘Mouse aggression’ by Tamara Baker (AstraZeneca, UK), ‘Handling and dosing refinements’ by Julia Bartlett (University of Bristol, UK) and ‘Zebrafish embryo genotyping’ by Claire Allen (University of Sheffield, UK). These provided up-todate information on improving animal care and welfare through innovative monitoring and procedural refinements. The LARN (Large Animal Research Network) Section provided insightful discussions on: the challenges to maximise refinement in large animal experiments by Eddie Clutton (University of Edinburgh, UK) and how technological innovations are proving instrumental in better approaches for assessing and promoting the health and welfare of farm and laboratory animals by Helen Gray and Matt Leach (Newcastle University, UK). LASA is strongly committed to continuing its support for innovations across all lab animal species, and therefore it is important that the large animal research community should receive LASA’s support and that the association can continue to promote broad collaboration with other lab animal fields. The second meeting day started with the eternally challenging discussions on experimental design and reproducibility. The Education, Training and Ethics (ETES) Section set up an engaging and highly participative symposium addressing the currently hot topic of sex bias in preclinical research and Natasha Karp (AstraZeneca, UK) explored how to change this, and, importantly, Matt Leach (Newcastle University, UK) looked at how we can all continue to combat the",Laboratory Animals.

Despite many studies on the topic conducted in the past decades, we are still far from a good understanding of ongoing rapid changes in the Arctic Ocean and how they will affect phytoplankton and the whole ecosystem. An example is the difference in net primary production modelling estimates, which differ twice globally and fifty times when only the Arctic region is considered. Here, we aim to improve the quality of Greenland Sea primary production estimates, by testing different versions of primary production model against in situ data and then calculating regional estimates and trends for 1998-2022 for those performing best. As a baseline, we chose the commonly used global primary production model and tested it with different combinations of empirical relationships and input data. Local empirical relationships were taken from measurements by the literature and derived from the unpublished data of Institute of Oceanology of Polish Academy of Sciences across the Fram Strait. For validation, we took historical net primary production 14C data from literature and added to it our own gross primary production O2 measurements. Field data showed good agreement between primary production measured with 14C and O2 evolution methods. From all the model setups, those including local chlorophyll a profile and local absorption spectrum best reproduced in situ data. Our modelled regional annual primary production estimates are equal to 346 TgC/year for the Nordic Seas region and 342 TgC/year for the Greenland Sea sector of the Arctic defined as 45°W-15°E, 66°33′N-90°N. These values are higher than those previously reported. Monthly values show a seasonal cycle with less monthly variability than previously reported. No significant increase or decrease in primary production was observed when studying regionally averaged trends. The accuracy of the selected here model setups to reproduce the field data in terms of Root Mean Square Difference is better than in the related Arctic studies. The improved primary production estimates strengthen researchers’ ability to assess carbon flux and understand biogeochemical processes in the Greenland Sea.",Frontiers in Marine Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/fmars.2024.1491180?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1491180, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fbd40abde38b0237b42bcbac2f650981d3cfb157,Bibliometric and visualized analysis of research relating to minimally invasive spine surgery reported over the period 2000–2022,"Background Since entering the 21st century, there has been an increasing interest in minimally invasive surgery for spinal diseases, which has led to the continued development of minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS), with major breakthroughs in technology and technical skills. However, in recent years, there is little relevant research using bibliometrics to analyze the field of MISS research. The purpose of this study is to sort out the publication situation and topic trends of articles in the field of MISS research from the perspective of bibliometrics. Methods The articles and reviews related to MISS from 2000 to 2022 were retrieved and downloaded from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC). Visualization and knowledge mapping were performed using three bibliometric tools, including online bibliometric platform, CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. Curve fitting and correlation analysis were performed using Microsoft Excel software. The global research publication output, contributions of countries, institutions, authors, and journals, average citations per item (ACI), Hirsch index (H-index), research hot keywords, etc., in this field were analyzed. Results A total of 2384 papers were retrieved, including 2135 original papers and 249 review papers. In the past 22 years, the number of annual publications of MISS research has shown a steady growth trend. China contributed the most papers, and the United States ranked second, but the United States had the highest total citations, and H-index value. The most prolific institutions were Soochow University, Capital Medical University and Wooridul Spine Hospital. In this field, Professors Lee SH, Ahn Y and Yang HL have made significant achievements. However, there is relatively little international collaboration between institutions or researchers. World Neurosurgery is the most published journal on MISS research. According to the keyword co-occurrence analysis, recent keywords mainly focus on researches on minimally invasive modalities, techniques and prognosis, while on the keyword analysis of the ongoing bursts, percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy, lumbar diskectomy, spinal stenosis, recompression, diskectomy, endoscopic spine surgery, laminectomy, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, etc., will likely continue to be a research hotspot in the near future. Conclusion Looking at the temporal trend in the number of publications per year, the number of publications for the MISS study will increase in the near future. China has the highest number of publications, but the US has the highest quality publications. International cooperation needs to be further strengthened.

In view of the modern context of new trends in the development of science, fundamental knowledge, modern methods and technologies, as well as of climatic and economic challenges, the development of the scientific heritage of N.I. Vavilov plays a big role for scientific and technological development. A total of 185 oral presentations was made at the 5th Vavilov International Conference. Meetings of the Conference attracted over 330 participants. This publication reflects the main objectives and content of the performed activities and contains key recommendations emanating from the Conference, including (1) recommendations for the conservation, study and use of PGR, including those on the multidisciplinary basis; (2) recommendations on activities to ensure coordination in the field of conservation, research, breeding and seed production; (3) recommendations on the normative and legislative regulation in the sphere of breeding, seed production, development, maintenance and use of genetic resource collections; (4) recommendations on training, guidance and education. Presentations made at the Conference show that over the past five years there has been a significant increase in the use of modern methodical approaches, i.e. molecular-genetic, genomic and omics in the field of PGR research. All this provides a solid basis for the development of new breeding methods (Next-Generation Breeding). At the same time, it is emphasized that new breeding technologies based on the acquired knowledge, can lead to further progress not in isolation from, but in conjunction with the amassed heritage of classical breeding. Among the discussed and proposed issues, the Conference Resolution identifies those requiring special and urgent attention: (1) the need to legislate for the preservation and expansion of crop diversity in the State Register of Varieties and Hybrids of Agricultural Plants Approved for Use; (2) the inadmissibility of reducing the list of these crops; (3) the inadmissibility of reducing of the number of state variety testing sites; (4) the inadmissibility of reducing of time limits of state variety testing from three to two years or one year; (5) the need to bring the concepts of “genetic passportˮ and “genetic passportizationˮ used in legal and regulatory acts to the canonical understanding of “genetic passportˮ as a document reflecting individual genetic features of an organism (cultivar/hybrid/breed/strain), which make it possible to distinguish its genotype from that of other organisms (cultivars/hybrids/breeds/ strains) of a particular species and the need to carefully elaborate methods of genetic certification of each crop, taking into account all types of genetic markers (molecular-genetic markers (DNA markers), protein and morphological markers). The Conference also noted that under the conditions of the increasing climate change and its sudden unpredictable fluctuations, reliable conservation of valuable plant genetic resources in situ and ex situ is required in order to avoid the irreversible loss of part of plant agrobiodiversity. In addition, extensive expeditionary surveys should be undertaken in the nearest future in crop and CWR diversity centers, under-explored areas, as well as in the regions with extreme environmental conditions and those prone to anthropogenic impacts.",PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BREEDING,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://biosel.elpub.ru/jour/article/download/176/173', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30901/2658-6266-2022-4-o6?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30901/2658-6266-2022-4-o6, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1df92b7cc83a097f9e51c4fb201a066447479ef1,The Second Year with Small Science,"With this issue, we are opening the third volume of Small Science. For a young journal that aims to establish an eminent reputation in the scientific community, this is an exciting time. Even though we have seen two very successful years at this point, the challenges and demands for a modern and impactful scholarly journal are continuously increasing. For our readers and authors, we strive for the presentation of a publishing platform that adheres to the highest standards of research integrity, reproducibility, and editorial processes. At the same time, your best research deserves a maximum of accessibility and visibility, fairness during editorial evaluation and peer review, as well as speedy processing. This can only be accomplished by a consistent development of our editorial workflows journal. Thus, our team is continuously working on the improvement of technical processes and editorial policies to guarantee highest quality for the manuscripts we publish in alignment with an excellent publishing experience. Below, I would like to illustrate the most important developments within the last year. While our colleague Debora Walker unfortunately left the team in 2022, we welcome two new editors. Jiaqi Li, based in Beijing, China, and Sneha K. Rhode, based in Oxford, UK, who are already integral parts of Small Science efficiently contributing with their scientific and editorial expertise on a daily basis. More recently, José Olivera had to step down from his role as Editor-in-Chief of Small due to his wider leadership role within Wiley. Neville Compton has now taken over the role as Small’s Editor-in-Chief and as Publisher for our nanoscience portfolio including our sister journals Small Methods, Small Structures, and Nano Select. With 30 years of experience in scholarly publishing as well as various leadership roles in Wiley’s Chemistry portfolio, Neville is ideally qualified to coordinate our portfolio on a strategic level. To get an impression on our whole Small family, visit our new special collection: Best of the Small journals 2022, where outstandingmanuscripts from our journals are showcased. Based on the very positive feedback for our virtual symposium “Spotlights in Small Science” in 2021, we decided to host another event together with our sister journal Advanced Science. We were honored that highly renowned researchers Zhenan Bao (Stanford Uni., USA),Ali Khademhosseini (Terasaki Inst., Los Angeles, USA), and Hua Kuang (Jiangnan Uni., Wuxi, China) presented their results in the session “Advances in Biomedical Research” whereas Shengzhong (Frank) Liu (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China), Arumugam Manthiram (Uni. of Texas at Austin, USA), and Stefan Hecht (DWI Leibniz Inst. for Interactive Materials, Germany) talked about their outstanding research in the session “Advances in Smart Materials and Energy Research”. You can access recordings of these exceptionally interesting symposia here. Wiley-VCH editors have developed a new feature to standardize data reporting in collaboration with expert researchers: data reporting checklists. These cover sheets are now a part of our submission process for original research articles. Each checklist indicates what we consider the absolute minimum parameters that should be reported in manuscripts for a particular field of research.Data reporting checklists not only assist authors to understand data reporting expectations and guide their manuscript preparation, but also help reviewers during manuscript evaluation. Currently, we have checklists available for research involving the performance/stability of solar cells or for batteries and supercapacitors; additional checklists for other research areas are under development. In the course of the year, we will start publishing the checklists along with the Supporting Information files for accepted manuscripts. As a reviewer, you may have noticed that we introduced a new workflow in our journals. Small Science and its sister journals now notify our reviewers of the editorial decision for the manuscripts they evaluated. The other, anonymized, reviewer reports are also shared.

Despite successful treatment options for the acute episode, recurrence rates are high, on average four times in a life span. Areas covered Both pharmacological as non-pharmacological evidence-based therapeutic options to prevent and treat recurrent depression are discussed. Expert opinion Although some risk factors for recurrence are well known, better evidence is needed. Antidepressant medication should be continued after acute treatment at its full therapeutic dose for longer periods, at least 1 year. There are no clear differences between classes of antidepressant medication when treatment is focused on preventing relapse. Bupropion is the only antidepressant with a proven efficacy to prevent recurrence in seasonal affective disorder. Recent findings conclude maintenance subanesthetic ketamine and esketamine treatment can be effective in sustaining antidepressant effect following remission. Furthermore, the pharmacological approach must be integrated with lifestyle interventions, especially aerobic exercise. Finally, combining pharma- and psychotherapy seems to improve outcome.

Therefore, more and more attention has been paid for biomarker identification for early diagnosis, prognosis prediction and prognosis evaluation of melanoma. However, there is still a lack of a report that comprehensively and objectively evaluates the research status of melanoma biomarkers. Therefore, this study aims to intuitively analyze the research status and trend of melanoma biomarkers through the methods of bibliometrics and knowledge graph. Objective This study uses bibliometrics to analyze research in biomarkers in melanoma, summarize the field’s history and current status of research, and predict future research directions. Method Articles and Reviews related to melanoma biomarkers were retrieved by using Web of Science core collection subject search. Bibliometric analysis was performed in Excel 365, CiteSpace, VOSviewer and Bibliometrix (R-Tool of R-Studio). Result A total of 5584 documents from 2004 to 2022 were included in the bibliometric analysis. The results show that the number of publications and the frequency of citations in this field are increasing year by year, and the frequency of citations has increased rapidly after 2018. The United States is the most productive and influential country in this field, with the largest number of publications and institutions with high citation frequency. Caroline Robert, F. Stephen Hodi, Suzanne L. Topalian and others are authoritative authors in this field, and The New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of Clinical Oncology and Clinical Cancer Research are the most authoritative journals in this field. Biomarkers related to the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of melanoma are hot topics and cutting-edge hotspots in this field. Conclusion For the first time, this study used the bibliometric method to visualize the research in the field of melanoma biomarkers, revealing the trends and frontiers of melanoma biomarkers research, which provides a useful reference for scholars to find key research issues and partners.",Frontiers in Oncology,2023.0,8,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2023.1181164/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10327294, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Over the past 15 years, the HMDB has grown and evolved significantly to meet the needs of the metabolomics community and respond to continuing changes in internet and computing technology. This year's update, HMDB 5.0, brings a number of important improvements and upgrades to the database. These should make the HMDB more useful and more appealing to a larger cross-section of users. In particular, these improvements include: (i) a significant increase in the number of metabolite entries (from 114 100 to 217 920 compounds); (ii) enhancements to the quality and depth of metabolite descriptions; (iii) the addition of new structure, spectral and pathway visualization tools; (iv) the inclusion of many new and much more accurately predicted spectral data sets, including predicted NMR spectra, more accurately predicted MS spectra, predicted retention indices and predicted collision cross section data and (v) enhancements to the HMDB’s search functions to facilitate better compound identification. Many other minor improvements and updates to the content, the interface, and general performance of the HMDB website have also been made. Overall, we believe these upgrades and updates should greatly enhance the HMDB’s ease of use and its potential applications not only in human metabolomics but also in exposomics, lipidomics, nutritional science, biochemistry and clinical chemistry.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2021.0,392,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-pdf/50/D1/D622/42058215/gkab1062.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8728138, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

912d1e36ef06a234c3110e8975e8646938eec60d,Evolving patterns of extreme publishing behavior across science,"Extreme publishing behavior may reflect a combination of some authors with genuinely high publication output and of other people who have their names listed too frequently in publications because of consortium agreements, gift authorship or other spurious practices. We aimed to evaluate the evolution of extreme publishing behavior across countries and scientific fields during 2000-2022. Extreme publishing behavior was defined as having >60 full articles (original articles, reviews, conference papers) in a single calendar year and indexed in Scopus. We identified 3,191 authors with extreme publishing behavior across science excluding Physics and 12,624 such authors in Physics. While Physics had much higher numbers of extreme publishing authors in the past, in 2022 extreme publishing authors was almost as numerous in non-Physics and Physics disciplines (1,226 vs. 1,480). Excluding Physics, China had the largest number of extreme publishing authors, followed by the USA. The largest fold-wise increases between 2016 and 2022 (5-19-fold) occurred in Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, India, Italy, Russia, Pakistan, and South Korea. Excluding Physics, most extreme publishing authors were in Clinical Medicine, but from 2016 to 2022 the largest relative increases (>6-fold) were seen in Agriculture, Fisheries & Forestry, Biology, and Mathematics and Statistics. Extreme publishing authors accounted for 4,360 of the 10,000 most-cited authors (based on raw citation count) across science. While most Physics authors with extreme publishing behavior had modest citation impact in a composite citation indicator that adjusts for co-authorship and author positions, 67% of authors with extreme publishing behavior in non-Physics fields remained within the top-2% according to that indicator among all authors with >=5 full articles.

TaRL is an approach to learning that aims to ensure that students understand the subject matter being taught. It focuses on identifying students' levels of understanding and aligning them with the appropriate level of learning. The research method uses descriptive language with two cycles. Data analysis techniques use qualitative and quantitative analysis. Each cycle consists of planning, implementation, observation, and reflection. The subjects of this research were 40 class XD students at SMAN 7 Banjarmasin for the 2022–2023 academic year. The learning process in TaRL groups students into three categories, namely students with intermediate, above, and below-average levels. Material and problems are given according to their level of learning, but still with the same learning objectives and outcomes. Student learning outcomes in learning activities increased from pre-cycle, showing a classical completeness of 32.5%; cycle I showed a classical completeness of 62.5%; and cycle II had reached the success indicator with a classical completeness of 87.5%.

0035ee2fbff1e3560275d7bebdaa4967db3423b9,The Issue of Gender Bias Represented in Authorship in the Fields of Exercise and Rehabilitation: A 5-Year Research in Indexed Journals,"Despite progress made in recent decades, gender bias is still present in scientific publication authorship. The underrepresentation of women and overrepresentation of men has already been reported in the medical fields but little is known in the fields of exercise sciences and rehabilitation. This study examines trends in authorship by gender in this field in the last 5 years. All randomized controlled trials published in indexed journals from April 2017 to March 2022 through the widely inclusive Medline dataset using the MeSH term “exercise therapy” were collected, and the gender of the first and last authors was identified through names, pronouns and photographs. Year of publication, country of affiliation of the first author, and ranking of the journal were also collected. A chi-squared test for trends and logistic regression models were performed to analyze the odds of a woman being a first or last author. The analysis was performed on a total of 5259 articles. Overall, 47% had a woman as the first author and 33% had a woman as the last author, with a similar trend over five years. The trend in women’s authorship varied by geographical area, with the higher representation of women authors in Oceania (first: 53.1%; last: 38.8%), North-Central America (first: 45.3%; last: 37.2%), and Europe (first: 47.2%; last: 33.3%). The logistic regression models (p < 0.001) indicated that women have lower odds of being authors in prominent authorship positions in higher-ranked journals. In conclusion, over the last five years, in the field of exercise and rehabilitation research, women and men are almost equally represented as first authors, in contrast with other medical areas. However, gender bias, unfavoring women, still exists, especially in the last authorship position, regardless of geographical area and journal ranking.",Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology,2023.0,5,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/8/1/18/pdf?version=1676448031', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9944464, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is expected that many people have died because of the new COVID-19 virus who otherwise would not have died. Estimating the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality by the number of officially reported COVID-19-related deaths has been proven to be difficult due to several reasons. Because of this, a better approach, which has been used in many studies, is to estimate the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic by calculating the excess mortality for the pandemic years. An advantage of such an approach is that additional negative impacts of a pandemic on mortality are covered as well, such as a possible pandemic-induced strain on the healthcare system. Methods To calculate the excess mortality in Germany for the pandemic years 2020 to 2022, we compare the reported number of all-cause deaths (i.e., the number of deaths independently of underlying causes) with the number of statistically expected all-cause deaths. For this, the state-of-the-art method of actuarial science, based on population tables, life tables, and longevity trends, is used to estimate the expected number of all-cause deaths from 2020 to 2022 if there had been no pandemic. Results The results show that the observed number of deaths in 2020 was close to the expected number with respect to the empirical standard deviation; approximately 4,000 excess deaths occurred. By contrast, in 2021, the observed number of deaths was two empirical standard deviations above the expected number and even more than four times the empirical standard deviation in 2022. In total, the number of excess deaths in the year 2021 is about 34,000 and in 2022 about 66,000 deaths, yielding a cumulated 100,000 excess deaths in both years. The high excess mortality in 2021 and 2022 was mainly due to an increase in deaths in the age groups between 15 and 79 years and started to accumulate only from April 2021 onward. A similar mortality pattern was observed for stillbirths with an increase of about 9.4% in the second quarter and 19.4% in the fourth quarter of the year 2021 compared to previous years. Conclusions These findings indicate that something must have happened in spring 2021 that led to a sudden and sustained increase in mortality, although no such effects on mortality had been observed during the early COVID-19 pandemic so far. Possible influencing factors are explored in the discussion.",Cureus,2023.0,10,"{'url': 'https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/149410/20230626-18966-49ysst.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10292034, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Insights from an 8-year general practice service evaluation of a lower carbohydrate diet with weight loss,"Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is often regarded as a progressive, lifelong disease requiring an increasing number of drugs. Sustained remission of T2D is now well established, but is not yet routinely practised. Norwood surgery has used a low-carbohydrate programme aiming to achieve remission since 2013. Methods Advice on a lower carbohydrate diet and weight loss was offered routinely to people with T2D between 2013 and 2021, in a suburban practice with 9800 patients. Conventional ‘one-to-one’ GP consultations were used, supplemented by group consultations and personal phone calls as necessary. Those interested in participating were computer coded for ongoing audit to compare ‘baseline’ with ‘latest follow-up’ for relevant parameters. Results The cohort who chose the low-carbohydrate approach (n=186) equalled 39% of the practice T2D register. After an average of 33 months median (IQR) weight fell from 97 (84–109) to 86 (76–99) kg, giving a mean (SD) weight loss of −10 (8.9)kg. Median (IQR) HbA1c fell from 63 (54–80) to 46 (42–53) mmol/mol. Remission of diabetes was achieved in 77% with T2D duration less than 1 year, falling to 20% for duration greater than 15 years. Overall, remission was achieved in 51% of the cohort. Mean LDL cholesterol decreased by 0.5 mmol/L, mean triglyceride by 0.9 mmol/L and mean systolic blood pressure by 12 mm Hg. There were major prescribing savings; average Norwood surgery spend was £4.94 per patient per year on drugs for diabetes compared with £11.30 for local practices. In the year ending January 2022, Norwood surgery spent £68 353 per year less than the area average. Conclusions A practical primary care-based method to achieve remission of T2D is described. A low-carbohydrate diet-based approach was able to achieve major weight loss with substantial health and financial benefit. It resulted in 20% of the entire practice T2D population achieving remission. It appears that T2D duration <1 year represents an important window of opportunity for achieving drug-free remission of diabetes. The approach can also give hope to those with poorly controlled T2D who may not achieve remission, this group had the greatest improvements in diabetic control as represented by HbA1c.","BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health",2023.0,32,"{'url': 'https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/bmjnph/early/2023/01/10/bmjnph-2022-000544.full.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10407412, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a77fc332276b4f31b9255c84cde7621f9622e95f,Death-associated with human monkeypox outbreak 2022: the current perspectives – correspondence,"Dear Editor, Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a neglected tropical-zoonotic viral disease that is endemic in Central and Western Africa. However, unprecedented outbreaks of monkeypox were recorded across all six WHO regions beyond the African regions in May 2022. As of November 6, 2022, the WHO reports a total of 78,229 (77,301 in nonendemic areas and 928 in endemic-African areas) laboratory-confirmed cases of monkeypox as well as 41 deaths (28 cases outside Africa) across 109 various countries (https://www. cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/world-map.html). MPXV is thought to be a self-limiting illness that only affects African populations; however, there has been a sudden increase in the number of MPXV infections since May 2022, which is largely linked to men who have sex with men. The majority of MPXVinfested individuals experienced vesiculopustular lesions in the anogenital region following fever and lymphadenopathy. According to recent comprehensive studies, MPXV transmission occurs through direct contact with contaminated cutaneous lesions. In addition, there is a need for further investigation regarding the impact of body fluids (eg, breastmilk, semen, vaginal fluid, amniotic fluid, or blood) in boosting the MPXV transmission cycle. On July 23, 2022, WHO declared the MPXV outbreak of 2022 a public health emergency of international concern as a consequence of the unexpected sudden rise in MPXV cases across the globe, the lack of effective immunity resulting from the smallpox vaccine cession, as well as the absence of exclusive therapeutic agents. Scientists proposed a novel nomenclature to distinguish the resurgentMPXV2022 (as clade 3) from the previous sublineages, that is, the Congo Basin lineage as clade 1, as well as the West African lineage as clade 2. Recent studies have shown that the R0 of MPXV clade 3 is substantially higher than 1, elucidating the sustained transmission of MPXV clade 3 in high-risk populations, for example, young esbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, as well as pediatrics. From the beginning until June 2022, WHO reports 72 human deaths due to monkeypox, all of which occurred in Africa (64 deaths occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo). However, 41MPXV-related deaths will occur in the first 11months of 2022, there are 41 MPXV-related deaths. According to a review of the literature, the reasons for deaths caused by MPXV 2022 have gained little attention, which is critical for better clinical practice. Herein, we pooled data from previous observational studies to discuss the reasons for deaths among MPXV-infected patients. Previous research suggested that children under the age of 10 accounted for one-third of MPXV-related deaths from the 1970s to the 1990s. D’Antonio et al. reveal MPXV infection during pregnancy is linkedwith intrauterine fetal death. In anothermetaanalysis, DeWitt et al. suggested that being a child is considered a key risk factor for MPXV death. Furthermore, MPXV-related deaths have been documented in high-risk individuals, such as infants, young children below 10, pregnant women, and those who were immunocompromised in previous MPXV outbreaks before 2022. There are different virus behaviors after the reemergence of the monkeypox outbreak in 2022; for example, all documented death cases due to monkeypox in nonendemic regions were middle-aged men.MPXV-associated deaths in 2022 have a risk factor, for example, lymphoma as well as septic shock in Brazil and encephalitis in Spain, as well as respiratory failure and acute renal failure in a 41-year-old with HIV/tuberculosis coinfection from Peru. According to a large surveillance in the WHO European Region, a large portion of MPOXV-related hospitalization and death cases involved people who had not received smallpox vaccination, were HIV positive, and had rash, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms. Miller reported the clinical characteristics of severe MPXV in hospitalized patients in the USA; they found that male gender, HIV infection, and STI coinfection are the most risky comorbidities associated with death. All MPXV-related deaths occurred among unvaccinated individuals. According to the data presented, immune disorders, a lack of vaccination, HIV infection, cutaneous ulcers, bacterial superinfection, septic shock, and respiratory complications all contribute to monkeypox morbidity and mortality. During the course of an infection, MPXV has extended viremia to human organs, which may result in invasion of the central nervous system, lungs, and kidney. In this situation, serious MPXV consequences such as encephalitis and organ failure are possible. The superimposition of bacterial soft-tissue coinfection can potentially result in septic shock,which has been linked to deadly sepsis. Further research is required to understand MPXV-related mechanisms of death. According to the literature, varied case fatality rates (CFRs) related to Congo Basin and Central African clades have been observed (ranging from 2.8 to 11%).

Employing a quantitative research design, the study involved 91 respondents and two evaluators. The research instruments included four First Quarter Summative Tests, an Evaluation Instrument for Quality Assurance of the Contextualized SIMs, and an Evaluation Instrument for Content, Accuracy, Recency of Information, and Contextualization. Data analysis was conducted using frequency count, percentage distribution, and weighted mean. The findings revealed that the majority of learners did not meet expectations in their performance on the four summative tests. Specifically, many learners struggled with differentiating solutes from solvents, describing the appearance of a suspension, and explaining methods for separating mixtures through decantation and magnet use. The SIMs were designed and developed using guide cards, activity cards, assessment cards, enrichment activity cards, reference cards, and answer keys. These contextualized SIMs were evaluated based on quality assurance, content accuracy, recency of information, and contextualization criteria. Enhancements to the SIMs were made according to the validators' suggestions.",Randwick International of Education and Linguistics Science Journal,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.47175/rielsj.v5i4.1103', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47175/rielsj.v5i4.1103?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47175/rielsj.v5i4.1103, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, the role of actors at the interface of science and society such as science communicators in structuring wicked problems remains widely unclear. This paper analyzes how science communicators translate wicked problems in their science communication activities focusing on two research questions: How do science communicators understand the problem territories they are dealing with in terms of their wickedness? And to what degree do science communicators aim to tame or communicate wickedness to the public? To answer these two questions, 20 science communication projects implemented within the German Science Year 2022 “Participate” were analyzed. Data were collected through 20 online interviews with science communicators, including both open and closed questions. Results reveal that the wickedness of public policy problems only partly translates into science communication practice: Science communicators understand problems rather broadly, crystallizing in a rather medium degree of wickedness. At the same time, science communicators tend to tame wicked problems by addressing specific facets of problems rather than translating the overall wickedness they perceive. Results add to research about the role of different actors in structuring wicked public policy problems and the role of intermediary actors in these processes, in particular.",Review of Policy Research,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1111/ropr.12641', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/ropr.12641?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/ropr.12641, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4e45065ab0978dbf4dcf2eccdefb59de271d08d7,Spatiotemporal Distribution of Photographic Records of Brazilian Birds Available in the WikiAves Citizen Science Database,"About four million photographic records of Brazilian birds are deposited in the WikiAves database. The objective of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of photographic records available in this database. Searches were performed in the database in 2022. Record numbers produced by citizens were obtained by selecting states and municipalities in different periods. The annual record production in Brazil has increased substantially since 2009, reaching about 400,000 records per year in 2020–2021. Most records were obtained in the Sudeste and Sul geopolitical regions. Seasonal variations in record production in the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest are comparable, with more records obtained in July–October. In Amazonia, a more substantial decrease in record production occurred between November and April. The monthly record production was more uniform in the Caatinga. When municipalities were compared, similar seasonal variation in record production was observed for four ecosystems (Amazonia, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado and Pampa). However, substantial differences were observed for municipalities in the Pantanal and the Caatinga. The results indicate that high human density, high individual income and the breeding season of birds are potential factors leading to high record production. On the other hand, heavy rainfall, flooding, remoteness and environmental harshness are pointed out as factors potentially leading to relatively fewer records. Further, this article discusses the implications of record availability for ornithological studies that use photographic records deposited in the WikiAves database.",Birds,2023.0,12,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6004/4/1/3/pdf?version=1674382457', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/birds4010003?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/birds4010003, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The research addresses two primary questions: (1) What is the overall effect size of informal science learning experiences on students' attitudes towards and interest in STEM? (2) How do various moderating factors (e.g., types of informal learning experience, student grade level, academic subjects, etc.) impact student attitudes and interests in STEM? The studies included in this analysis were conducted within the United States in K-12 educational settings, over a span of thirty years (1992–2022). The findings indicate a positive association between informal science education programs and student interest in STEM. Moreover, the variability in these effects is contingent upon several moderating factors, including the nature of the informal science program, student grade level, STEM subjects, publication type, and publication year. Summarized effects of informal science education on STEM interest are delineated, and the implications for research, pedagogy, and practice are discussed.",International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education,2024.0,3,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1007/s10763-024-10504-z', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s10763-024-10504-z?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s10763-024-10504-z, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c21f47d337124b66c40f5687dfbd9bdb6a280493,How to embrace interdisciplinarity in sport science – An approach at the ÖSG Congress Innsbruck 2024,"Introduction
The 19th Congress of the Austrian Sport Science Society (“Österreichische Sportwissenschaftliche Gesellschaft, ÖSG”), held in Innsbruck, Austria, centered on the theme of” Embracing Interdisciplinarity in Sport Science.” The idea of interdisciplinarity in sport science has been discussed for over three decades and stems from its position as a cross-sectional discipline integrating various natural and social sciences such as training science, sports medicine, biomechanics, sport pedagogy, sport psychology, sport sociology, and sport history. More recently, sports economy and sports management have also emerged as significant areas within sport science. Sports science is characterized by its strong practical relevance. It often focuses on applied research, where interdisciplinarity plays a critical role.
Interdisciplinary work is a particularly important factor when approaching sport science from a problem-based perspective (Güllich & Krüger, 2022). Specifically, we argue that interdisciplinarity becomes crucial when we are trying to develop solutions for complex challenges in sport, the health sector, and society in general. For example, an interdisciplinary approach in sport science might merge aspects of psychology, physiology, and sociology with expertise of medical professionals to study and realize health promotion strategies. For the purpose of this editorial, we understand interdisciplinarity as a collaboration between individuals from different scientific disciplines but also from different professions with the goal of combining knowledge and methods to create new solutions for complex societal problems. This can range from the simple communication of ideas and experiences to mutual integration of concepts, methodologies, procedures, or data sharing (Zaiț et al., 2021). We think that sport scientists can and should take a leading role in such collaborations given their unique cross-disciplinary education related to human health, performance, and well-being. Leadership in interdisciplinary collaborations may be an opportunity for us as sport scientists to strengthen our profile and image in the society and to take responsibility in addressing societal challenges (Hottenrott et al., 2017).
In preparation of this year’s ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024, we tried to embrace this idea of interdisciplinarity in sport science. Before the event, we conducted an online survey across the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) to identify current societal challenges that sport science should address and help with developing solutions. In parallel, we assessed the perceived importance of interdisciplinary work among sport scientists and related professions. Potential respondents to the survey were mainly contacted through the communication channels of the ÖSG and its equivalent associations in Germany (dvs) and Switzerland (SGS). Consequently, respondents included sport scientists as well as professionals from other fields who follow or are part of the activities of sport science associations. The findings of the survey were used in three different ways and will be described in this editorial:

to summarize the most frequently mentioned challenges and topics that sport science should address and help with developing solutions,
to develop an “Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop” for the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024 where delegates transform the identified challenges into specific problems that can be solved, and
to compare the survey results with the content of the scientific abstracts submitted to the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024 and determine the alignment between the identified challenges and current research topics within the ÖSG community.

The survey – Current challenges for sport science and beyond
The survey responses were analyzed in MAXQDA 24 (VERBI software, 2021). The MAXQDA AI-Assist tool was used to suggest an initial coding scheme to group responses into categories. Two researchers refined the scheme into a final code set, independently coded the participants’ responses, and discussed mismatches to agree on the final code assignments. The survey yielded 176 responses, of which 85 were fully completed. Respondents (42% women) had a mean age of 40.2 years (± 13.8). Regarding their primary professional field, 34% identified as scientists working at a university, college, or research institution, 26% were healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians or therapists), 15% worked in the private sector including self-employment, 13% were students or educators, and 12% were either coaches, athletes, or employed within a sports federation. 91% reported that interdisciplinarity was a key component of their work.
The most frequently mentioned challenges fell into the category of “prevention and rehabilitation” (34%), followed by “job profiles related to sport science and exercise therapy” (23%), “sport science mission for research and education” (11%), “broader societal issues” (5%), “structural development of organized and non-organized sports” (5%), “inclusion and integration through sports” (4%), “self-awareness and self-reflection” (3%), “technological progress” (2%), “financing” (2%), and “elite sports” (2%; orange bars in Figure 1). Coding was not possible for 5% of the answers.
The workshop – Transforming challenges into specific problems
Building on the findings of the survey, we collaborated with the ikivox collective (Nyon, France, https://ikivox.org/en/) to develop an “Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop” held at the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024. With the help of ikivox who specialize in collective intelligence and collaborative design approaches, we designed a workshop with the following objectives:

to transform the identified challenges into specific problems that can be solved with innovative solutions
to experience interdisciplinary collaboration and new ways of working together
to position the Austrian Sport Science Society (ÖSG) as an enabler, bringing value to its members to improve exchange about sport science in Austria
to identify whether the teamwork could continue on some topics after the Congress with the support of the ÖSG

Eventually, 42 Congress delegates signed up for the workshop and could choose to work on one of the following challenges: “physical inactivity at the work place”, “physical inactivity in children”, “image of sport science in society”, “role of exercise therapists in medical teams”, “influence of menstrual cycle on athletic performance”, “health awareness in society”, “inclusion of bodily disabled individuals as participants in public sport events”, and “integration of girls and women with migration background through sports”. This format of collaboration may provide a framework for future interdisciplinary initiatives within the ÖSG and beyond.
The Congress abstracts – Comparing the identified challenges with actual research topics at the ÖSG Congress
Having identified current challenges for sport science, it seemed of interest to compare those challenges with the content of the submitted scientific contributions to the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024. The Congress received 78 contributions including 60 regular abstracts, 12 Young Investigator Award submissions and 6 extended abstracts. Five section editors managed the peer-review process and drew on the expertise of 45 peer reviewers. Each contribution was evaluated and rated by two independent reviewers. Critical feedback of reviewers had to be addressed by the authors in revised abstract submissions. Following the revision round, 75 contributions were accepted for presentation at the Congress. The contributions spanned a wide range of research areas including “biomechanics, motor control & sports technology” (26% of abstracts), “sport psychology & pedagogy” (25%), “sports medicine, exercise therapy & public health” (20%), “sports physiology & exercise science” (16%), “sports sociology, economy & management” (14%). Of all contributions, 64 were presented orally and 11 as poster presentations while 65 abstracts were published in the Congress proceedings.
When applying the same code set to the abstract submission, we found a remarkable similarity to the survey findings in that 34% of abstracts fell into the category of “prevention and rehabilitation” (blue bars in Figure 1). However, we also found clear mismatches: the content of the abstracts focused much more on “technological progress” (21% vs. 2% in survey), and “elite sports” (15% vs. 2% in survey). Further, while 23% of the survey respondents highlighted challenges in “job profiles related to sport science and exercise therapy”, none of the conference abstracts addressed this topic, indicating a gap between perceived challenges and ongoing research.
Summary and outlook
At this year’s ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024, we tried to embrace interdisciplinarity in sport science by taking a problem-based approach to sport science. Based on a pre-Congress survey, we identified key challenges within sports and society in general that should be addressed by sport scientists. The most frequently mentioned challenges were related to the topic of “rehabilitation and prevention”, specifically physical inactivity in children and at the workplace. At the Congress, delegates participated in an “Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop” to work on the identified challenges and transform them into more approachable and specific problems. Interestingly, the topic of “rehabilitation and prevention over the lifespan” was also dominant in a third of scientific contributions to the Congress, showing alignment between perceived challenges and research efforts in the ÖSG community. In contrast, the topics of “elite sports” and “technological progress” were highly represented in Congress abstracts but were not perceived as current challenges in the survey. In turn, more than 20% of survey respondents perceived challenges related to the job profile of sport science alumn",Current Issues in Sport Science (CISS),2024.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.36950/2024.4ciss001?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.36950/2024.4ciss001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This was done during the First Quarter of School Year 2022-2023 to the 81 Grade 10 students of Sarrat National High School. 35-item researchers-made test (pretest and posttest) and a motivation checklist were used to gather data. Teaching using traditional lecture-discussion methods was done in both groups but with the addition of QQTIHPRS in the experimental group. Students’ pretest and posttest scores were analyzed using frequency distribution and percentage. The t-test was used to find out if there exists significant difference between the students’ mean scores in the pretest, posttest, and pretest and posttest in both experimental and control groups. The mean was used to analyze data from the students’ motivation checklist. Results showed that both groups have gained significantly higher scores in the posttest than in the pretest. However, the posttest mean score of the experimental group is significantly higher than that of the control group. This implies that the students in the experimental group performed better than those in the control group. It was also found that when QQTIHPRS were utilized in teaching Earth Science, students were actively involved; excited and thrilled; motivated to work, shared their ideas, and established camaraderie and teamwork. These findings show that the use of QQTIHPRS in addition to the usual lecture-discussion method enhanced the performance of students in Earth Science.",American Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Innovation,2023.0,4,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.54536/ajmri.v2i2.1458', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.54536/ajmri.v2i2.1458?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.54536/ajmri.v2i2.1458, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The initial release of near-real-time (NRT) atmospheric and oceanic science products from Japanese Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 (H8/9) geostationary (GEO) satellites over the South China Sea (SCS) was unveiled in 2024. The primary objective behind crafting these NRT H8/9 satellite products is to facilitate weather and marine environment monitoring, enhance maritime security, and aid ocean navigation, among other purposes. As part of this investigation, a novel NRT data processing system was devised to generate a variety of regional H8/9 GEO satellite science products within a resolution of 10 min and a gridded resolution of 0.05° × 0.05° from 3 November 2022 to the present. This algorithm system was built upon the preceding Fengyun (FY) geostationary satellite algorithm test bed (FYGAT), which was the prototype of the FY-4 GEO meteorological satellite science product operational processing system. These regional H8/9 GEO satellite science products encompass a range of crucial data such as cloud mask, fraction, height, phase, optical, and microphysical properties; layered precipitable water; and sea surface temperature. We subjected these products to rigorous evaluations against high-quality analogous satellite products and reanalysis data spanning 1 year in 2023. The validations underscore a strong consistency between the H8/9 GEO satellite atmospheric and oceanic science products over the SCS and the referenced products. Nevertheless, slight discrepancies in these satellite science products were identified, primarily stemming from variations in sensor/dataset characteristics, retrieval algorithms, and geometric conditions. These outcomes demonstrate the suitability of the first edition of NRT atmospheric and oceanic science products of H8/9 satellites over the SCS in supporting the intended quantitative applications. This NRT GEO satellite data record is publicly accessible through the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) provided by the Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) in China. Free access to the dataset is possible via https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25015853 (Liu et al., 2024).

69c9eb9350a847c711402c8a858303006965d92d,552 Substance Abuse Research: Bench to Community (SARB2C) as a Model for Team Science,"OBJECTIVES/GOALS: To present Substance Abuse Research: Bench to Community (SARB2C) as a model for team science both within and between institutions. Emerging from targeted efforts by the NIH to engage translational scientists in prominent public health issues, the initiative illustrates the benefits of bringing together researchers and trainees to share ideas. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: In 2019 a group was formed at University of Florida to discuss ongoing translational research in the area of substance abuse, including faculty, staff, and trainees from across the campus. The group was expanded in February 2022 to include domestic colleagues at the University of Kentucky as well as international collaborators at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand. One-hour monthly meetings began in person but now take place virtually. Larger projects are discussed individually, focusing on opportunities for collaboration. Attendees also provide updates on their work, including proposals in development and manuscripts in process. This facilitates dialogue around the science, from the bench to the community, and connects people to advance team science. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In light of the ongoing opioid epidemic and the public health threat of other emerging substances, collaboration among researchers in this area is essential to advance the science and explore real-world solutions. SARB2C demonstrates the benefit of connecting researchers across T0 to T4, and that of including trainees for invaluable experience. This environment fosters open discussion and creativity and helps break down the silos that impede science. A highlight from early in the group’s history was a visit from the Program Officer for the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute in February 2020.

ae5e7da26f9d910b8091c983b65cdf4fd9964226,Exploring preservice science teachers' attitudes toward environmental technologies,"Understanding attitudes toward environmental technologies appears essential because of the need for profound societal changes associated with using new technologies to protect the environment. However, a lack of research investigating the attitudes of preservice science teachers toward environmental technologies exists in the current research literature. Therefore, this study aimed to examine preservice teachers' attitudes toward environmental technologies. A total of 196 students enrolled in a large Russian public university formed the participants of this research. Researchers used a scale for data collection. We administered the scale to the participants in the spring semester of the 2022 year. This scale included three sub-dimensions and 24 items. We analyzed pre-service teachers' attitudes in age, branch, and gender. The results showed that the developed scale consisted of three dimensions: positive, benefit, and negative. The results demonstrated that the participants in this research demonstrated moderate and low mean scores regarding the positive aspects of environmental technologies. The participants also demonstrated very positive attitudes regarding the benefits of environmental technologies. Regarding the negative aspects of environmental technologies, the participants had the lowest mean scores compared to the other items of the first two factors. The results also revealed some significant differences in participants’ age, branch, and gender.

In today's fast-paced world, technology plays a crucial role in education. With the rise of the internet, technology-driven education has become the norm. However, it is essential to understand this impact on students, especially in the field of Hospitality Management. Hence, this study aimed to bridge the gap between technology-driven education and practical learning experiences. Quantitative description research was used in this study, which involved collecting data through a survey questionnaire. The study's respondents were 128 second, third, and fourth-year Hospitality Management students who were enrolled in the first semester of the academic year 2022-2023 at Gabaldon Campus, NEUST. A total sample technique was used to select the respondents. The results showed that most students preferred traditional face-to-face learning over distance learning. They felt that they could retain the information better when taught in a traditional classroom setting. The students also said they preferred the interaction and hands-on experience they got from traditional face-to-face learning. However, the study also found that students appreciated the flexibility distance learning offered. They felt that they could study at their own pace and had the option to pause the lecture whenever needed. This made the learning process less stressful for them. Based on the results, the researchers recommend that future studies may use this study as a basis for further research in the field. They also suggested that teachers may integrate brainstorming activities to improve the skills of their students. Additionally, they recommended that teachers integrate mobile phones into the classroom to enhance teaching flexibility. In conclusion, this study aimed to gather the perceptions of Hospitality Management students who have experienced both distance learning and traditional face-to-face learning.

830d5923fc5dfafbb3c2afbf73454a411b58888a,Differentiated Instruction for an Enhanced Students’Academic Performance in Science 10 (PHYSICS),"The study aimed to determine the effectiveness of Differentiated Instruction strategy using selected Multiple Intelligences activities on the students’ performance in Science 10 (Physics). The researcher employed quasi-experimental research and a descriptive method utilizing questionnaires as the principal tool to gather the data. The respondents involved in the study were the One Hundred Twenty (120) Grade 10 Junior High School students of Bagong Nayon II National High School, Antipolo City, during the school year 2022-2023. They were grouped according to their dominant Multiple Intelligence. The study revealed that among the first five dominant multiple intelligences of the students, the majority of the students are more on intrapersonal intelligence rather than the other. This implies that some of the respondents perform more in intrapersonal tasks and skills which would then indicate that teachers should assess each learner's multiple intelligence to know and enhance students' performance in academics. The use of Differentiated Instruction in teaching Science 10 (Physics) greatly improved the performance of the students in terms of their academics. This was shown on the pretest and posttest performance of the students in which their posttest performance increased greatly after the utilization of  differentiated instruction in teaching Science 10. It can also be noted that the Intrapersonal Group of students got the highest increase in mean score. The average mean score in the pretest is 19.49 and 35.69 in the posttest with the mean increase of 16.20. This implies that although the students were given different activities, they all performed well. Based on the findings of the study, teachers can use differentiated instruction for the purpose of enhancing the academic performance of the students. This also implies that the prepared activities intended for these groups of students were effective.

f08213f8839663bb5b197d4ac23afc20b842014a,29th NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC PRACTICAL CONFERENCE “NATURAL SCIENCE EDUCATION IN A COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL – 2023”: CONFERENCE REVIEW,"This year, the scientific conference ""Natural Science Education in a Comprehensive School - 2023"" was held in its usual format. It is worth mentioning that during the Covid-19 pandemic, three conferences were held remotely, in 2020, 2021 and 2022.
This two-day conference focused on science and technology education, which is a recent priority in society. There is a need to improve the teaching of science subjects and technology at all levels of general education. Particular attention should be paid to early science education. Ensuring adequate science and technology education means providing children with an education that teaches them to reason, think logically, explore, be creative and active. 
The plenary session of the conference was international and very interesting. A total of four keynote speeches were presented during this session. It is clear that the Plenary ""bridged"" different continents - Africa, Latin America, Europe. Professor Andris Broks discussed systemic issues in science and technology education, with a particular focus on the major challenges and changes of the present. Speakers from South Africa and Brazil shared their experiences in organising research activities for future teachers. Experiences from both countries in the training of science teachers were explored. The plenary also discussed developments in science education in the updated General Curricula in Lithuania. 
Informal discussions at the conference focused on educational experiences during the pandemic. All participants acknowledged that education in a pandemic is significantly more difficult. This is especially true for various non-formal education activities, or activities that take place outside the regular classroom (e.g. various project activities, research activities, etc.).
Participants, especially those who are more or less regular attendees, stressed the importance of a ""live"" meeting. After all, informal communication has the main purpose of enabling a person to understand and be understood. This cannot be achieved in an online (remote) conference. It was hoped that the work of the conference would continue.
Most conference reports were presented in the form of articles and published in the conference proceedings. One can find full texts in the database at: https://oaji.net/journal-archive-stats.html?number=1984&year=2023&issue=20002

d09e03adf1c7b46e4c8ccae7da691ac1e8008413,Student-Led Curricular Development in the Biomedical Science Master’s Program Using Virtual Dissection,"The Anatomage table is a virtual dissection technology increasingly used to supplement anatomy education while its efficacy and integration is still being evaluated. To address the gap in student curricular leadership in such technological integration, previous master’s and current medical students led a curricular development effort to design, create, and incorporate hands-on Anatomage learning activities into a master’s level anatomy course during the 2021–2022 academic year. To assess changing perspectives regarding the table’s role in curriculum integration and content retention, surveys were conducted before and after voluntary participants completed the learning activities. Overall, participants had a more positive perspective on the integration of the Anatomage table into the curriculum and its use to retain material compared to non-participants. Participants were significantly more likely to feel motivated to learn anatomy while interacting with the table. Compared to peers who only experienced the table in didactic lecture, activity participants were significantly more likely to perceive that the table helped them learn the skeletal system, a perception supported by significantly higher scores on skeletal anatomy exam questions. Less positive perspectives were observed overall for the muscular system, demonstrating the efficacy of the table varied with content.

and market-dependent, and suffers 
frequent distresses posing threat to the 
welfare of farmers as well as interest in 
farming. Declining farm productivity and 
income have serious implications on 
rural prosperity and overall economy. 
Hence, increasing the real farm income, 
i.e. nominal (actual) income adjusted to 
inflation has become a priority for the 
state and policy planners. The Government 
of India, in its budget 2016–17 proposed 
to double the farmers’ income by 
2022 (marking the 75th year of Independence) 
by addressing the agrarian 
distress and crisis. Indian agricultural 
databases lack farmer income series. 
Nevertheless, it has been estimated from 
survey data that the farm income growth, 
currently hovering around 1%, has declined 
since 2011–12 (ref. 1). We discuss 
here the farm income trends across holding 
sizes and states, as well as disaggregated 
sources of farm income using the 
National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) 
data for 2003 and 2013 (ref. 2). The potential

The research was carried out with 32 teacher candidates studying at Sakarya University Faculty of Education, Department of Science Education in the 2021-2022 academic year. The Word Association Test was used as a data collection tool, and the key concepts of ""environment"" and ""environmental problems"" were given to the students and the students were made to make associations about these concepts. Then, the students were asked to make a sentence about the concepts of environment and environmental problems. Content analysis method was used in the analysis of the data obtained, and in this context, categories and codes were created for the answers given to the Word Association Test. The results regarding the key concept of ""environment"" were evaluated under five main themes: ""ecosystem elements"", ""ecosystem types"", ""ecological concepts"", ""environmental problems"" and ""feelings and thoughts"". The theme of ecosystem elements; the theme of “living elements”, “non-living elements” and ecosystem varieties; “natural ecosystems” were examined under the sub-themes “artificial ecosystems”. It can be said that the pre-service teachers who participated in the research have knowledge structures about the environment in general. However, pre-service teachers' perceptions of the living environment show more diversity than their perceptions of the inanimate environment. It was observed that the number of answers regarding inanimate objects was low. Likewise, while making sentences about the environment, they mentioned inanimate objects very little. Other evocative words are ecological concepts that are quite numerous and varied. They also associated it with environmental problems. In addition to these, there are answers such as ""we should be sensitive and conscious of the environment, we should protect it,"" in the perceptions of teacher candidates. It is important to have these in their perceptions, that is, to associate their feelings and thoughts with the environment. When the evaluation is made on the concepts that are associated rather than the number of answers given by the pre-service teachers, it has been revealed that they do not have a sufficient level of environmental perception. Student associations towards environmental problems; It has been expressed under the themes of ""types of environmental problems"", ""reasons of environmental problems"" and ""results of environmental problems"", and it has been determined that the connotations of pre-service teachers are gathered under the theme of ""reasons of environmental problems"". In their sentences, they talked more about the causes and consequences of environmental problems. It was determined that pre-service teachers made associations and formed sentences by addressing environmental problems more locally. As a result of the study, it was determined that the perceptions of the teacher candidates about the environment and environmental problems were not at a sufficient level and necessary suggestions were made in this regard.",SOCIAL SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31567/ssd.1074?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31567/ssd.1074, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Based on the quantitative research approach, this study was conducted using a quasi-experimental method. The sample of the study consists of 146 student teachers studying at the education faculty of a state university in the fall semester of the 2022-2023 academic year. The sample group was conducted with student teachers who chose four different science-based courses and voluntarily participated in the study. The Biophilia Scale with 25 items was used as a data collection tool. The findings showed that the biophilia levels of the participants in all four courses showed significant differences in favor of the post-tests. The findings also showed that the ""environmental science"" course's scale scores significantly differed from the other courses. In other words, the biophilia levels of student teachers who attended environmental science courses increased less than in the other courses. When the increase in biophilia level of student teachers according to their genders is examined, no difference was observed. As a result of the findings, it was suggested that more activities should be included in science-based lessons to increase students' biophilia levels.",Journal of Science Learning,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ejournal.upi.edu/index.php/jslearning/article/download/186/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17509/jsl.v6i2.54928?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17509/jsl.v6i2.54928, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Moreover, acquiring financial literacy is crucial for young people, as it equips them with the skills needed to autonomously and effectively manage financial matters in their future. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the extent of financial literacy among 70 Grade 12 students during the School Year 2021-2022 at the Philippine Science High School-Ilocos Region Campus. To achieve this, a mixed methods research approach was employed, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative analyses. To collect data, an online survey, consisting of a financial literacy questionnaire, was administered through Messenger and Google Forms. The data obtained were subjected to various analytical methods, including content analysis, mean and percentage calculations, Likert scales, and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) with the Wilks’ test. The results unveiled that the students possess a satisfactory level of knowledge and confidence when it comes to financial matters and transactions. Furthermore, the outcomes of the MANOVA analysis indicated that there is no significant overall correlation between the students’ gender and their scholarship categorization concerning their financial literacy levels. It is recommended that future studies consider increasing the sample size and adjusting the sampling methodology to enhance the precision of the results, particularly in investigating the potential links between scholarship categorization, gender, and students’ financial literacy levels.

We sought to determine whether known contaminants in Puerto Rico can contribute to the selection of a bioassay to add granularity to geospatial contamination data at the cellular level. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A PubMed literature search was conducted: Puerto Rico AND Vieques AND Environmental Contaminants AND Heavy Metals OR Phthalates OR Metals OR PCB OR Air Pollution OR CVOC . Additional inclusion criteria were free full text, English language and year of publication between 2000 to 2022 (n = 244 studies). References that were not related to Puerto Rico and environmental contaminants in air, soil, water, or vegetation were excluded. A second PubMed literature search was conducted to determine whether a clinical link has been established between contaminant exposure and the male reproductive system. Search terms were: heavy metals AND hypospadias OR cryptorchidism NOT female NOT animal NOT review , heavy metals AND male infertility NOT female NOT animal NOT review . The same strategy was used for phthalates. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We found that 12 out of 15 studies that were conducted in the Archipelago of Puerto Rico between 2000-2022 reported heavy metals- and/or phthalates- contamination in soil and water. We also found that there is a paucity of clinical studies that consider plausible relationships between a given contaminant and congenital conditions or male reproductive function. Specifically, we found that heavy metal exposure has been linked to hypospadias (n=1 study), comorbidity of hypospadias plus cryptorchidism (n= 1 study) or male infertility (n=14 studies). Phthalates exposure has been linked to comorbidity of hypospadias and cryptorchidism (n=1 study) or male infertility (n=1 study). Male subfertility has been overlooked so far. We noted that Sertoli cell dysfunction has been linked to all of these conditions. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The geography of Puerto Rico provides an opportunity to close the gap in knowledge between environmental contamination and male reproductive health. Based on our findings, we propose that the use of a bioassay with an immortalized Sertoli cell line can uncover the cellular processes that may be affected in male reproduction upon contaminant exposure.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8C4F6FA10B5108C675C1E830AFE97E59/S2059866123001644a.pdf/div-class-title-80-the-need-for-a-clinical-and-translational-science-framework-to-bridge-environmental-contamination-data-and-male-reproductive-health-div.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10129646, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In the year 2022, around 2,87,800 new cases were diagnosed, and 43,200 women faced mortality due to this disease. Analysis and processing of mammogram images is vital for its earlier identification and thus helps in reducing mortality rates and facilitating effective treatment for women. Accordingly, several deep-learning techniques have emerged for mammogram classification. However, it is still challenging and requires promising solutions. This study proposed a newer automated computer-aided implementation for breast cancer classification. The work starts with enhancing the mammogram contrast using a haze-reduced adaptive technique followed by augmentation. Afterward, EfficientNet-B4 pre-trained architecture is trained for both original and enhanced sets of mammograms individually using static hyperparameters’ initialization. This provides an output of 1792 feature vectors for each set and then fused using a serial mid-value-based approach. The final feature vectors are then optimized using a chaotic-crow-search optimization algorithm. Finally, the obtained significant feature vectors were classified with the aid of machine learning algorithms. The evaluation is made using INbreast and CBIS-DDSM databases. The proposed framework attained a balanced computation time with a maximum classification performance of 98.459 and 96.175% accuracies on INbreast and CBIS-DDSM databases, respectively.",International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems,2024.0,19,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s44196-024-00409-8.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s44196-024-00409-8?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s44196-024-00409-8, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Global Markets and India","

3D printing is a rapidly growing technology with features of enhanced
customizability, reduced errors, zero material waste, reduced costs, and quick turnaround
times. In this work, the data were collected from the Derwent Innovation and Web of Science
databases for patent and publication search, respectively.



The results were critically
analysed and correlated with the global and Indian market growth. USA (with 5 out of the top
ten patent contributing companies), China, Germany, France, and Taiwan were determined to
be the top countries with the maximum number of patents on 3D printing technology. Both patents and publications exhibited consistent growth until 2011. From 2012 onwards, the rate of
patent filings began to surpass that of academic publications, indicating a shift in the dynamics.



This trend has continued over the years, leading to a notable difference between the
number of patents (19,322) and publications (10,571) in the year 2022. India has been found to
rank 8th in 3D printing innovation and research, globally.

The impact of social distance between students and their teachers is particularly apparent in large introductory classes, exacerbated by students' lack of common prior experience in computer science. Some institutions remedy class size and experience gaps by hiring advanced undergraduate students as teaching assistants for their introductory courses. However, without the resources to carefully hire, train, and manage undergraduate teaching assistants (uTAs) during the semester, their potential as trustworthy peer mentors and helpful tutors often goes unrealized. This poster presents details of the uTA hiring process, training course, and management strategies used during the 2022-2023 academic year for the introductory computer science courses at the University of Delaware (UD), a large, public, research-focused institution. This system was designed for introductory CS classes, with the goals of low instructor overhead, long-term scalability, and the development of empathetic teaching assistants who could motivate students toward successful learning. Highlights of the system include a hiring process that considers candidates' personality and enthusiasm alongside their technical skills, asynchronous training provided through the university's learning management system, and the use of a head uTA to manage other staff members. Following the implementation of these policies, instructors and uTAs alike reported positive experiences compared to previous semesters without significant changes to students' learning outcomes.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3626253.3635613?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3626253.3635613, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0fe4422f63f888739debb346425c2ba5c22ed75e,156 Art as a Multiplier of Science Communication,"OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Scientists are increasingly confronted with 'science critical' #_msocom_1 belief systems. The politicization of science fuels hesitancy towards evidence-based therapies. To overcome these barriers, we aim to devise strategies to communicate clinical translational science (CTS) through art. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A two-year pilot artist-in-residency (AIR) program embedded in the Translational Research Immersion Program (TRIP). Since 2009, TRIP contributes to CTS Workforce Development (WD) through a 10-week mentored, curriculum-rich summer undergraduate research experience. Students are recruited from 5 regional institutions, 6 HBCUs, and the University of Puerto Rico. AIR is composed of 3 phases: the “Immersive Phase” where the artist gains intensive exposure to the scientific process through the lived experience of TRIP students, the “Productive Phase” where the artist conceptualizes the process of CTS into works of art, and the “Engagement Phase” where the CTS workforce, artists, and community members coalesce around science-to-art materializations. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In 2022 & 2023 the AIR participated in ~35hrs of CTS research seminars, panel discussions, and professional skills workshops. Additional TRIP student-AIR interaction occurred in focus groups including visits to mentor’s labs. An AIR-led workshop culminated in an Empowering CTS Communication event where TRIP students engaged with community members through elevator pitches of their CTS summer project on a speed-rotating basis. A month-long art-CTS exhibition planned for 3/2024 will feature contributions from AIR, TRIP students, and ITMAT community members. Qualitative insights were that TRIP is an effective art-science incubator, students strengthened their CTS communication skills, art functions as an icebreaker between science and communities with an ocean of opportunities for science education. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: AIR embedded into existing CTS WD programs is proposed as creative approach to strengthen the reputation of science in the public. CTS-informed art functions as connective tissue between public and CTS workforce. The hands-on experience to adopt art as a science communication tool is a powerful soft skill for the next generation of CTS investigators.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/A11D10F860E8F7E389B771C6F50B40C2/S2059866124001523a.pdf/div-class-title-156-art-as-a-multiplier-of-science-communication-div.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11026755, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a11da23a46570be0479b832e65aadff3ced3012b,The association between academic pressure and adolescent mental health problems: A systematic review,"Background: Academic pressure is a potential contributor to adolescent mental health problems, but international evidence on this association has never been synthesised. Methods: We conducted the first systematic review on the association between academic pressure and adolescent depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicidality, suicide attempts and suicide. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ERIC and Web of Science (core collection) up to November 24, 2022, for studies of school-going children or adolescents, which measured academic pressure or timing within the school year as the exposure and depression, anxiety, self-harm, or suicidal ideation, attempts or suicide as outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We used narrative synthesis to summarise the evidence. The review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021232702). Results: We included 52 studies primarily from Asia (n=26) and Europe (n=20). Most studies assessed mixed anxiety and depressive symptoms (n=20) or depressive symptoms (n=19). Forty-eight studies found evidence of a positive association between academic pressure or timing within the school year and at least one mental health outcome. Limitations: Most studies were cross-sectional (n=39), adjusted for a narrow range of confounders or had other limitations which limited the strength of causal inferences. Conclusions: We found evidence that academic pressure is a potential candidate for public health interventions which could prevent adolescent mental health problems. Large population-based cohort studies are needed to investigate whether academic pressure is a causal risk factor that should be targeted in school- and policy-based interventions.",medRxiv,2023.0,90,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2023.07.028', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1101/2023.01.24.23284938?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.24.23284938, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6a29ae803b93ce4fae2a02499c6325e53b653e0d,A Comparison of Different Defuzzification Methods on Road Traffic Accidents of Data of Khuzdar Region of Balochistan Province of Pakistan," Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) is an alarming cause of many deaths and injuries. It is considered as a major public health issue. Multiple families have been engraved due to RTAs.  Researchers from all over the world are focusing on RTAs because it is a challenging issue. In developed countries, RTAs have been minimized and are being controlled via modern methods of computer science. Similarly, people in Pakistan are facing RTA as their major issue gulping hundreds of lives every day and thousands yearly. In Balochistan province of southern Pakistan, the National Highway 25 (N-25) called Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD) road faces severe RTA issues. According to Medical Emergency Response Center (MERC) overall 25,033 accidents have been recorded from Oct-2019 to Oct-2022 with 33,726 injuries and 653 deaths. This shows the alarming condition of N-25 for public and also serious challenges for the traffic controlling authorities. In Khuzdar area, poses every year more than five thousand RTAs happen taking around 250-300 lives and two hundred injuries having 500 to 600 accidents disabled person (ADPs). However, other studies have been focused on generally on fuzzy methods but this study has been used five defuzzification methods which is the new contribution in to the field of fuzzy logics and Artificial intelligence tools. In this research, we have presented a Fuzzy Inferencing System (FIS) for investigating the RTAs with a case study specific to Khuzdar area from Baghbana to Pir Umar. A comparison of five defuzzification methods, namely centroid, bisector, Smallest of Maximum (SOM), Large of Maximum (LOM) and Medium of Maximum (MOM) was made. The results indicated that Large of Maximum (LOM) method is able to provide scalable output which is better in reflecting the ambiguities of the related variables, their membership functions, and associated rules. After comparison of defuzzification method it was seen that these methods can be useful in reduction of the RTAs which will also help the traffic authorities of N-24 MERC, police and other controlling authorities.

Evaluating lecturer performance is a crucial step in ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the teaching process which includes pedagogical, professional, personality, and social indicators. Conventional approaches are often complex and ineffective in identifying in-depth performance patterns. The K-Means Clustering algorithm enables the grouping of evaluation data into clusters based on feature similarities, thus revealing patterns that are difficult to discern manually. The data used in this study comes from lecturer evaluation questionnaires completed by students during the even semester of the 2022/2023 academic year. The results showed that the clustering process yielded good separation with a Silhouette Score of 0.593 and a Davies-Bouldin Index of 0.606. These findings indicate that the data within the clusters are more similar to each other than to data in different clusters, suggesting effective clustering. The insights gained from this study are expected to be valuable for the management and development of teaching quality and to promote the use of artificial intelligence technology in higher education evaluations.

Recommendations on future pandemic preparedness for public libraries are also discussed in this article. This research project conducted a bilingual (English and French) online survey targeting public library technicians, librarians, and library board members across Canada. From 1,631 research invitation emails sent to public library staff across Canada and three Facebook posts on Canadian public library staff groups, over a one-year period from November 3, 2021, to November 6, 2022. 226 individuals participated in the online survey questionnaire. Findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated social inequalities in Canada, including access to computers and the Internet. The digital divide could lead to poor health outcomes and put existing disadvantaged populations at greater risk in terms of future employment opportunities. The digital divide needs to be addressed so that Canadians in low-income households and those living with disabilities do not get left behind. Importantly, public libraries in Canada have been working tirelessly to equalize access to computers, the Internet, and digital literacy training and support. Their determination, social responsibility, and professional ethics need to be acknowledged.

They are attractive subjects because they predictably emerge in large numbers; have a complex biogeography shaped by both spatial and temporal isolation; and include three largely sympatric, parallel species groups that are, in a sense, evolutionary replicates. Magicicada are also relatively easy to capture and manipulate, and their spectacular, synchronized mass emergences facilitate outreach and citizen science opportunities. Since the last major review, studies of Magicicada have revealed insights into reproductive character displacement and the nature of species boundaries, provided additional examples of allochronic speciation, found evidence for repeated and parallel (but noncontemporaneous) evolution of 13- and 17-year life cycles, quantified the amount and direction of gene flow through time, revealed phylogeographic patterning resulting from paleoclimate change, studied the timing of juvenile development, and created hypotheses for the evolution of life-cycle control and the future effects of climate change on Magicicada life cycles. New ecological studies have supported and questioned the role of prime numbers in Magicicada ecology and evolution, found bidirectional shifts in population size over generations, quantified the contribution of Magicicada to nutrient flow in forest ecosystems, and examined behavioral and biochemical interactions between Magicicada and their fungal parasites and bacterial endosymbionts.

d90d240524c38b223910691bec6754cecf554563,Multifaceted applications of biochar in environmental management: a bibliometric profile,"More than 75% biochar-related documents were published in the last five years itself. Most studies focussed on pollutant removal (>2000) and soil improvement (~1000). Focus on other applications: manage waste> produce energy> mitigate climate change.  The Chinese dominate in publications, primarily enabled by extensive research funding. Artificial intelligence could be critical in producing application-specific biochar. Biochar is a carbon-containing material prepared through thermal treatment of biomass in limited supply of oxygen, and used for an array of applications including waste management, climate change mitigation, soil fertility improvement, bio-energy production, and contaminant remediation. The data related to biochar, its production, and the wide applicability were collected using Web of Science Core Collection Database (on 25/10/2022), while bibliometric network analysis was performed using VOSviewer software to analyse year-wise, author-wise, country-wise, and journal-wise publication trends, construct keyword co-occurrence maps, and identify research areas receiving greater focus. Further, the applications of biochar were reviewed and mechanistic insights were provided. Some of the findings include: > 50% of documents (> 13,000) getting published in the past 3 years, > 90% of documents (> 21,000) being research articles, ~ 50% of publications (> 10,000) being related to environmental sciences, pyrolysis being the most widely used (~ 40% articles) production technique (followed by carbonization, gasification, combustion, and torrefaction), China being the most active country in terms of publications (> 11,000), and biochar being mostly used for removing contaminants (followed by soil improvement, waste management, energy production, and climate change mitigation). Various strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis) of biochar production and wide-ranging applicability were identified. Lastly, gaps were identified including the need for performing elaborate life cycle assessments, exploring machine learning and artificial intelligence for upgrading conversion technology and producing application-specific biochar, and investigating mechanistic aspects of soil-biochar interactions and nano-scale transformation of biochar. The study covers a broad spectrum of biochar applicability to identify areas receiving lesser attention, which could guide the future researchers for augmenting biochar research.

724e2fb8fab876805fe11e8354df9425a65cc747,Parker Solar Probe: Four Years of Discoveries at Solar Cycle Minimum,"Launched on 12 Aug. 2018, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe had completed 13 of its scheduled 24 orbits around the Sun by Nov. 2022. The mission’s primary science goal is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun’s coronal magnetic field, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. Parker Solar Probe returned a treasure trove of science data that far exceeded quality, significance, and quantity expectations, leading to a significant number of discoveries reported in nearly 700 peer-reviewed publications. The first four years of the 7-year primary mission duration have been mostly during solar minimum conditions with few major solar events. Starting with orbit 8 (i.e., 28 Apr. 2021), Parker flew through the magnetically dominated corona, i.e., sub-Alfvénic solar wind, which is one of the mission’s primary objectives. In this paper, we present an overview of the scientific advances made mainly during the first four years of the Parker Solar Probe mission, which go well beyond the three science objectives that are: (1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind; and (3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles.",Space Science Reviews,2023.0,66,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11214-023-00952-4.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02727, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The results show the five main contributing countries, these being: China, the United States, England, Canada, and Pakistan and the year 2022 will be the year of greatest scientific production. There are no records of studies in Latin America; however, scientific production is found in academic sites in Venezuela, Chile, Ecuador, and Argentina. Using the Laws of Lotka, Price, and the Bradford model, the most prolific authors and the productivity of countries and magazines are discovered. Using Zipf's law and the Hirsch index, the most frequent keywords and the best-known articles are revealed. The article has sought to contribute to the eighth goal of sustainable development (SDG), that is, with the study of ethical leaders who model behaviors that favor economic growth, work well-being, and sustainability of their organizations.

1f916ef43d2084065e5cb3ca594bee3fd1a02f6d,Do newer maize hybrids grow roots faster and deeper?,"Understanding historical changes in root depth attributes is needed for crop productivity and sustainability assessments, but such information is rare. We explored whether newer maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids grow roots faster and deeper than older hybrids and quantified the role of management and environment on root trait expression. We measured root front velocity (RFV) and maximum root depth in 11 Bayer Crop Science legacy hybrids released from 1983 to 2017 across five environments in the US Corn Belt during 2021 and 2022. Root depth was measured weekly during vegetative stages with manual probes and the maximum root depth at crop harvest with a Giddings probe. Results indicated that the RFV and maximum root depth slightly increased with the year of hybrid release (0.13% per year, p = 0.1) at 8.7 plants m−2. Historical increases in plant density from 4.7 to 8.7 plants m−2 lowered RFV and maximum root depth, but the new hybrids compensated for this loss, resulting in 4% higher RFV and 3% higher maximum depth when comparing systems from 1983 to 2017. The environment strongly influenced root trait expression (>41%). Rain anomaly and soil bulk density explained a portion of this variation. We found a linear relationship between root depth and leaf number (R2 = 0.95) and a nonlinear relationship between RFV and maximum root depth (R2 = 0.77), which can stimulate crop model improvements. Faster and deeper roots were not correlated with maize yields in our environments. This study enhances our understanding of maize breeding impacts on root traits.",Crop science,2024.0,7,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/csc2.21208', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/csc2.21208?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/csc2.21208, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aimed to determine the level of knowledge regarding HBV and HCV among Taibah University health science students. 
 
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among health science students from Taibah University, Saudi Arabia, using a validated online questionnaire from 14 February 2022 to 9 July 2022. HBV and HCV knowledge levels among applied medical sciences (AMS), nursing, medicine, medical rehabilitation sciences (MRS), pharmacy, and dentistry undergraduate students were evaluated. The questionnaire was divided into two parts. The first part comprised 5 demographic questions, while the second part comprised 10 questions regarding HBV and HCV infection. 
 
RESULTS: A total of 369 students participated in the survey. Knowledge levels regarding HBV and HCV were relatively low, with a mean knowledge score of 6.8 ± 1.8 (out of 10). Results revealed a positive correlation between students’ knowledge levels and year of education, with knowledge scores increasing with increases in participants’ academic year. Knowledge levels were primarily impacted by students’ disciplines. 
 
CONCLUSION: This study revealed inadequate levels of knowledge regarding HBV and HCV among health science students at Taibah University. There was a positive correlation between knowledge level and academic year. Efforts should be made to improve HBV and HCV knowledge through awareness campaigns, educational interventions, and preventive measure training.",Global Journal of Health Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/gjhs/article/download/0/0/49057/52897', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5539/gjhs.v15n8p54?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5539/gjhs.v15n8p54, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Miller. Morgantown, PA: Mastof Press, 2022. 224 pages. Paperback; $20.00. ISBN: 9781601268129. *Keith B. Miller has dedicated his career to conducting paleontological and geological research and teaching at a public university. In addition to his many contributions to the geoscience literature and his activity in professional societies, he has contributed multiple provocative articles that advanced faith and science dialogue, many in Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith. Readings on Evolution and the Nature of Science: One Christian's Perspective is a collection of sixteen of Miller's articles published between 1993 and 2018 and one previously unpublished manuscript. The articles are clustered among five sections that represent the foci of Miller's writing and public address. *In The Nature of Science section, Miller addresses misunderstandings of science held by the public. He describes how misconceptions have been promoted by traditional young earth creationists and intelligent design advocates who have great contemporary influence on churches, seminaries, local school boards, and state legislatures. In footnotes to the first article, ""The Similarity of Theory Testing in the Historical and 'Hard' Sciences,"" Miller reveals that the integrity of historical science (such as geology and paleontology) was debated in the development of Kansas science education standards. Drawing from the philosophy of science and using examples from geology, he defends historical science as not different from ""hard"" science in its predictive and explanatory power. *While evolution is the volume's overarching theme, in the second article Miller examines science's nature as applied to the public debate over anthropogenic global warming. He recognizes widely held misconceptions of science that fuel the rejection of controversial theories such as climate change and evolution. These include misunderstandings of fact and theory and the misconception that ""unproven"" theories should not become the basis for public action. To demonstrate the importance of scale and context in theory making, Miller presents actual data sets revealing patterns of global environmental change at different scales and timeframes. Incidentally, those climatic patterns up to 2012, the year of the article's original publication, have persisted since with increasingly observable and negative consequences. Finally, Miller considers the widespread rejection of scientific consensus motivated by religious, economic, political, or philosophical interests. *Two articles in this section focus on evolution as science, written to scientists and science educators likely holding an evolutionary view. In ""The Misguided Attack on Methodological Naturalism,"" Miller rejects the intelligent design (ID) movement's claim that methodological naturalism (MN), the presupposition that limits science's purview to natural phenomena, is effectively the denial of the existence and action of God. Miller identifies that MN originated as an attempt by a Christian philosopher to limit science from transgressing upon questions more appropriately pursued by the arts, theology, and philosophy. ""Ironically, by rejecting methodological naturalism, ID advocates have ended up supporting the very scientism that they claim to want to fight against"" (p. 26). The article continues with a critical overview of the ID movement and perceived implications for science practice and education. While located in the Evolution and Theology section of the book, this article pairs well with ""Design and Purpose within an Evolving Creation,"" in which Miller addresses claims about MN and evolutionary science by Phillip Johnson (1940-2019) and the ID movement. Miller's article was originally contributed to Darwinism Defeated? (Vancouver, BC: Regent College Publishing, 1999), a book that captured the debate between ID-anti-evolutionists and evolutionary creationists following the publication of Johnson's provocative Darwin on Trial (Downers Grove, IL: IVP, 1991). This section concludes with Miller's PSCF article, ""Doubt and Faith in Science and Religion"" (PSCF 70, no. 2 [2018]: 90-100), examining how both doubt and faith are relevant, even necessary, in both paths for pursuing truth. *Articles in the Evidence for an Evolving Creation section provide compelling examples of transitional forms and ancestral relationships in the history of life. Two serve as direct responses to claims that the Cambrian ""explosion"" is fatally problematic for evolutionary theory because so many different forms appeared so suddenly upon the first appearance of invertebrate groups (the Cambrian Period is dated between 542 and 490 million years ago). Miller describes the difficulty of assigning founding species early in life's history to taxonomic groups and provides examples of metazoans older than the Cambrian showing a progressive, rather than sudden, increase in body plan complexity. Miller presents a well-illustrated and well-referenced overview of the Precambrian fossil record. He argues that the ""explosion"" extended over 20 million or more years, preceded by at least 40 million years of increasing complexity among soft-bodied metazoans. *""Common Descent, Transitional Forms, and the Fossil Record"" is a clearly written and amply illustrated defense of evolution, highlighting different groups of mammals living on Earth over the past some 250 million years and their probable tetrapod ancestors. Miller ""climb[s] down the tree of life"" to demonstrate how increasingly older ancestors of living mammal groups become more difficult to distinguish from the oldest ancestors of other groups. ""Countering Common Misconceptions of Evolution in the Paleontology Classroom"" is written for college-level instructors, including an innovative cladogram construction exercise involving dinosaur taxa to demonstrate how evolutionary relationships are determined. Miller emphasizes that presenting scientific concepts in their historical context is an effective way to counter mistaken views that students bring to the classroom. *The nexus of Evolution and Theology is addressed with four articles (including one described above). In ""Theological Implications of an Evolving Creation,"" Miller explains that the evolutionary history of life is consistent with creation's integrity, enormity, and goodness; the immanent and progressive nature of God's creative activity; and the image of God in creation. ""An Evolving Creation: Oxymoron or Fruitful Insight?"" returns to the nature of science and theology, with an emphasis on exploring ways to diminish the conflict view of science and faith. The section's final article, ""God, Evolution, and Becoming Man"" was written for seminarians and describes the fossil record of hominins (modern humans and closely related extinct species), demonstrating potential evolutionary relationships using paleontological, genetic, and inferred behavioral comparisons. Miller comments on implications for the meaning of imago Dei and our understanding of body and soul. *The Problem of Evil section opens with the theological implications of natural hazards. Miller questions if natural catastrophes are a consequence of the Fall described in Genesis 3, satanic manipulations of nature, or generally reflect God's judgment on sinful humankind. Considering the testimony of the Psalms and other biblical narratives, he concludes that post-Fall creation is good. As well, the geologic record reveals that severe natural events occurred with regularity before the Fall. Disturbances we perceive as hazards are essential to the maintenance of natural systems (the natural order). Past attempts to control hazards, such as wildfire suppression, coastal modifications, and flood control often make those hazards worse. Biblical concepts of environmental stewardship can be applied in order to live in harmony with creation. *""'And God Saw That It Was Good': Death and Pain in the Created Order"" addresses the question of ""natural evil"" that leads to unbelief when unresolved, ""as it was for Darwin, himself"" (p. 198). Miller reviews traditional and novel approaches to theodicy. Recognizing that crucified Christ participates in the suffering and death of his creation, Miller proposes that ""physical death, pain, and suffering are opportunities for the expression of Christ-like character"" (p. 205). Miller draws insights on the problem of evil from J. R. R. Tolkien's Silmarillion and Lord of the Rings in the section's final essay. *Science as Christian Vocation is an article co-authored with Ruth Douglas Miller, ""Staying on the Road Less Traveled: Fulfilling a Vocation in Science."" The Millers encourage students and early career scientists to look to their faith, in its teaching and traditions, to motivate and guide their work in ways that glorify God and further his kingdom. *Throughout, Miller is keen to avoid the sacred/secular dichotomy, believing that God ""has a claim on all aspects of our lives"" (p. 1). Professors at some Christian colleges are required to write a ""faith and learning"" paper in order to achieve tenure, an onerous task for those not used to engaging theology in their professional work. Here, Miller has written seventeen such papers while employed by a ""secular"" university! Science educators can benefit from reading Miller's work to develop a sound understanding of the purviews of science and theology applicable to topics such as origins, climate change, and public health. I assigned multiple articles found in this volume as reading in several of my college courses. Remarkably, Miller was often three to five years ahead of resurging interest in many of these topics among evangelical scholars. Rather than re-publishing separate articles with modest overlap in material coverage, Miller might have organized the material into a unified text that could reach a wider or more targete",Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.56315/pscf12-23miller?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.56315/pscf12-23miller, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d0cca4710f1288f65930a2547eb4f8800c276d19,The strain on scientific publishing,"Abstract Scientists are increasingly overwhelmed by the volume of articles being published. The total number of articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science has grown exponentially in recent years; in 2022 the article total was ∼47% higher than in 2016, which has outpaced the limited growth—if any—in the number of practicing scientists. Thus, publication workload per scientist has increased dramatically. We define this problem as “the strain on scientific publishing.” To analyze this strain, we present five data-driven metrics showing publisher growth, processing times, and citation behaviors. We draw these data from web scrapes, and from publishers through their websites or upon request. Specific groups have disproportionately grown in their articles published per year, contributing to this strain. Some publishers enabled this growth by hosting “special issues” with reduced turnaround times. Given pressures on researchers to “publish or perish” to compete for funding, this strain was likely amplified by these offers to publish more articles. We also observed widespread year-over-year inflation of journal impact factors coinciding with this strain, which risks confusing quality signals. Such exponential growth cannot be sustained. The metrics we define here should enable this evolving conversation to reach actionable solutions to address the strain on scientific publishing.",Quantitative Science Studies,2023.0,48,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00327', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15884, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3aa780a6fba888f9dac2c4f0fc2a8dd12b112107,Introduction to the NJIAS Himawari-8/9 Cloud Feature Dataset for climate and typhoon research,"Abstract. The use of remote sensing methods to accurately measure cloud properties and their spatiotemporal changes has been widely welcomed in many fields of atmospheric research. The Nanjing Joint Institute for Atmospheric Sciences (NJIAS) Himawari-8/9 Cloud Feature Dataset (HCFD) provides a comprehensive description of cloud features over the East Asia and west North Pacific regions for the 7-year period from April 2016 to December 2022. Multiple cloud variables, such as cloud mask, phase/type, top height, optical thickness, and particle effective radius, as well as snow, dust, and haze masks, were generated from the visible and infrared measurements of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on board the Japanese geostationary satellites Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 using a series of recently developed cloud retrieval algorithms. Verifications with the Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) 1 km cloud layer product and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-2 cloud product (MYD06) demonstrate that the NJIAS HCFD gives higher skill scores than the Japanese Himawari-8/9 operational cloud product for all cloud variables except for cloud particle effective radius. The NJIAS HCFD even outperforms the MYD06 in nighttime cloud detection; cloud-top height, pressure, and temperature estimation; and infrared-only cloud-top phase determination. All evaluations are performed at the nominal 2 km scale, not including the effects of sub-pixel cloudiness or very thin cirrus. Two examples are presented to demonstrate applications of the NJIAS HCFD for climate and typhoon research. The NJIAS HCFD has been published in the Science Data Bank (https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.09950, Zhuge 2023a; https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.09953, Zhuge 2023b; https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.09954, Zhuge 2023c; https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.10158, Zhuge 2023d; https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.09945, Zhuge 2023e).

1316eff54de894675241aa6412edd1659ccced4b,Applying the engineering design process to teach the physics course for engineering students using the flipped classroom combined with an instructional design model,"PurposeThis study aims to examine the perceptions of students about learning science and physics using the engineering design process (EDP).Design/methodology/approachThe study employed a mixed-methods research design: The quantitative session features a pre–post-test control group study. In the qualitative aspect, the study conducted semistructured interviews for data collection. In the experimental group, the flipped classroom (FC) model and an instructional design are combined to design, develop and implement a physics course using the steps of the EDP, while the conventional method was applied to the control group. The respondents are students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Cao Thang Technical College in Vietnam for the academic year 2022–2023. The control and experimental groups are composed of 80 students each. An independent sample Mann–Whitney U test is applied to the quantitative data, while thematic analysis is employed for the qualitative data.FindingsThe results demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of perceptions about learning science and physics using the EDP, which, when combined with a FC, enhances physics learning for engineering students.Research limitations/implications This study implemented the EDP in teaching physics to first-year engineering students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering using the combined FC and instructional design models. The results revealed that a difference exists in the perception of the students in terms of integrating the EDP into learning physics between the experimental and control groups. The experimental group, which underwent the EDP, obtained better results than did the control group, which used the conventional method. The results demonstrated that the EDP encouraged the students to explore and learn new content knowledge by selecting the appropriate solution to the problem. The EDP also helped them integrate new knowledge and engineering skills into mechanical engineering. This research also introduced a new perspective on physics teaching and learning using the EDP for engineering college students.Practical implicationsThe research findings are important for teaching and learning physics using EDP in the context of engineering education. Thus, educators can integrate the teaching and learning of physics into the EDP to motivate and engage student learning.Originality/valueUsing the EDP combined with a FC designed under stages of the analyze, design, develop, implement and evaluate (ADDIE) model has enhanced the learning of physics for engineering college students.",Journal of Research in Innovative Teaching &amp; Learning,2024.0,3,"{'url': 'https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JRIT-07-2023-0095/full/pdf?title=applying-the-engineering-design-process-to-teach-the-physics-course-for-engineering-students-using-the-flipped-classroom-combined-with-an-instructional-design-model', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1108/jrit-07-2023-0095?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1108/jrit-07-2023-0095, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The purpose is to analyze the impact of management decisions on the performance indicators of the university in the conditions of temporary occupation and relocation to a new place. The relocation of Berdyansk State Pedagogical University (BSPU) to a safer territory enabled the resumption of educational activities in May 2022, after 53 days of functioning under occupation by russian troops. University staff decreased by 13%, with 57% moving to Ukraine-controlled territories and 43% remaining in the occupied zone. In addition, the student contingent decreased by 15%. The university’s scientific activity during the war decreased for only 9% in publication activity, and funding for science in 2023 increased by 379% compared to 2021. The university continued its third mission of social cooperation by providing humanitarian and psychological assistance and documenting the testimonies of people affected by the occupation. The university community currently exists in a virtual format, with staff and students in different parts of Ukraine and the world. The university must look to the future and overcome existing problems, such as preserving academic potential and student contingent, restoring electronic systems, and continuing pedagogical education.

535ea50dc5832a4194fc05c6e86acf5357ab24e3,"Breast cancer preventive practices and associated factors among reproductive age women in Wadila District, North East Ethiopia: community based cross-sectional study","Background Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Among all cancer types, breast cancer stands out as the most common and is characterized by distinct molecular characteristics. This disease poses a growing public health concern, particularly in low and middle-income countries where it is associated with high mortality rates. Despite these challenges, there is a paucity of data on breast cancer preventive practices and associated factors among reproductive-age women in Wollo, Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the level of breast cancer awareness, preventive practices, and associated factors among women of reproductive age residing in Wadila district, Wollo, Ethiopia in the year 2022. Method A cross-sectional community-based study involving 352 women of reproductive age in Wadila district was carried out between May and June 2022. Participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique, and data analysis was conducted using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 23 software. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine the odds ratio for variable associations, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Result The prevalence of breast-examination among women of reproductive age was determined to be 40.1% (95% Interval [CI]: 34.94–45.18). Factors such as educational status (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.13–0.6), income (AOR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.11–0.33), and family history of breast conditions in reproductive-age women (AOR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.08–3.34) were significantly linked to the practice of breast self-examination in this population. Conclusion The study highlighted a decline in regular breast self-examination among women of reproductive age. It revealed that the reduced frequency of regular breast self-examination was a prevalent concern among women in this age group and the broader community.

9595df062eee186685288477406e96c772cdeb28,Non-Cognitive Skills as Correlates to Academic Performance among Senior High School Students,"Today's teachers and students have a tremendous degree of duty for surviving in a competitive world and they have a growing level of responsibility to achieve in a highly competitive environment. Aside from cognitive skills, the non-cognitive skills are believed to play a crucial role for academic success as they can improve student motivation, engagement, and overall well-being. This study examined the correlation of non-cognitive skills to academic performance among students at General Luna National High School, Siargao Islands, Surigao del Norte, Philippines. The main tools used to gather information were an adapted research questionnaire for Grades 11 and 12 students. The study respondents were the 302 senior high school students under the general academic strand at General Luna National High School during the school year 2022 – 2023. Data gathered were analyzed using Frequency Count and Percentage, Means and Standard Deviations, Mann Whitney U-Test and Kruskal Wallis H-Test, Independent T-Test, and Spearman Rho Correlation to yield a generally significant difference and relationship based on the data outcomes from the respondents’ responses.The descriptive-correlational research design was used to evaluate the non-cognitive skills in the learning of senior high school students that link to their academic achievement in which purposive sampling was done to obtain 302 respondents. Results showed that the respondents still need assistance writing high-quality research papers and more confidence especially when collaborating with teachers in doing class projects even outside the class. Majority of them (64%) got a grade point average below 85% which implies a need to demonstrate a higher degree of academic performance. With p-values of 0.0001 and 0.0120, significant differences exist in the respondents’ academic performance when grouped based on sex and grade level, respectively. Furthermore, with correlation coefficient of 0.29 and p-value of 0.0001, it was revealed that there is a significant positive relationship between the respondents’ academic achievement and non-cognitive skills in terms of academic perseverance.

Methods Following a pre-registered protocol and PRISMA/AMSTAR-2 guidelines, we systematically screened MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, clinicaltrials.gov and Google Scholar from January 2020 to July 2022. We pooled proportion estimates via random-effects meta-analyses and explored subgroup differences by gender, occupational group, training stage, WHO regions/continents, and study end-year. We assessed risk of bias (Newcastle–Ottawa scale for observational studies, RοB2 for randomized controlled trials [RCT]) and rated evidence certainty using GRADE. Results Of the 171 489 publications screened, 2 249 were eligible, incorporating 2 212 observational studies and 37 RCTs, representing feedback from 1 109 818 learners and 22 204 faculty. The sample mostly consisted of undergraduates, medical doctors, and studies from institutions in Asia. Perceived training disruption was estimated at 71.1% (95% confidence interval 67.9–74.2) and learner redeployment at 29.2% (25.3–33.2). About one in three learners screened positive for anxiety (32.3%, 28.5–36.2), depression (32.0%, 27.9–36.2), burnout (38.8%, 33.4–44.3) or insomnia (30.9%, 20.8–41.9). Policy responses included shifting to online learning, innovations in assessment, COVID-19-specific courses, volunteerism, and measures for learner safety. For outcomes of policy responses, most of the literature related to perceptions and preferences. More than two-thirds of learners (75.9%, 74.2–77.7) were satisfied with online learning (postgraduates more than undergraduates), while faculty satisfaction rate was slightly lower (71.8%, 66.7–76.7). Learners preferred an in-person component: blended learning 56.0% (51.2–60.7), face-to-face 48.8% (45.4–52.1), and online-only 32.0% (29.3–34.8). They supported continuation of the virtual format as part of a blended system (68.1%, 64.6–71.5). Subgroup differences provided valuable insights despite not resolving the considerable heterogeneity. All outcomes were assessed as very-low-certainty evidence. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted health worker education, inflicting a substantial mental health burden on learners. Its impacts on career choices, volunteerism, pedagogical approaches and mental health of learners have implications for educational design, measures to protect and support learners, faculty and health workers, and workforce planning. Online learning may achieve learner satisfaction as part of a short-term solution or integrated into a blended model in the post-pandemic future.",Human Resources for Health,2023.0,25,"{'url': 'https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12960-023-00799-4', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9951171, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, to assess the quality of a teacher training program it is necessary to track some of the non-cognitive parameters. Metacognition is one of these parameters. The present study aimed at the longitudinal trajectory of the development of metacognition in pre-service teachers as an indicator of the quality of the applied teacher training program. The study included 160 pre-service elementary school teachers studying at Teacher Education Faculty at University of Belgrade. The participants’ metacognitive development was measured by Metacognitive Awareness Inventory at three points of time (the beginning of studying, the academic year 2021/22 – T1, the end of the first year – T2, and the end of the second year, 2022/23-T3). The elementary school teacher training program is based on a combination of science and pedagogy related courses that together with school teaching practice start from the first semester. The courses based on problem solving and inquiry-based approach encourage students’ search for adequate strategies and the assessment of their effectiveness. The findings point to a significant increase in total metacognition score between T1 and T2 and somewhat less intense increase between T2 and T3. The findings also point to a significant increase in all metacognitive subcomponents, with Conditional knowledge and Debugging strategies showing a significant increase only between T2 and T3. Between T1 and T2 the largest differences were detected in Declarative knowledge, Comprehension monitoring, and Planning. The results suggest that the teacher training program is metacognitively stimulating.","International Journal of Cognitive Research in Science, Engineering and Education",2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.23947/2334-8496-2024-12-2-251-257', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.23947/2334-8496-2024-12-2-251-257?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.23947/2334-8496-2024-12-2-251-257, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

984cd5ca388f19db1b4fbace5166f0c7b73adbba,Association of Platelet Count with Severity of Chronic Liver Disease,"Introduction: Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a significant global health concern, encompassing a range of liver pathologies with varying degrees of severity. This cross- sectional study aims to investigate the relationship between platelet count and the severity of CLD. Platelet count is a readily available and cost-effective clinical parameter that may serve as a valuable prognostic marker for CLD progression.  Materials and Method: The study included 122 patients in Chitwan Medical College Teaching Hospital (CMCTH) diagnosed with CLD during one year starting from March 2022. Data were collected using the proforma specially designed for this study. Parameters like age and gender, as well as brief clinical data, including liver function tests, imaging findings, and platelet count, were collected. Patients were then classified into different stages of severity based on established criteria, i.e. child Pugh Score system (CTP score). Statistical analyses were performed using a statistical package for the social science (SPSS); statistical program version 20.0, to explore the association between platelet count and CLD severity.  Results: The majority of patients who had chronic liver disease were found to be high in the age group of 40-60 years. Thrombocytopenia was found in 72.1% of chronic liver disease patients. After classifying the severity of chronic liver disease, it was found that 55.7% of patients had a severe disease that was CTP-C, 36.1% were found to be CTP-B and 8.2% were CTP-A. In patients with normal platelet count, 44.1% had CTP-B, 41.2 had CTPC and 14.7% had CTP-A score. In patients with thrombocytopenia, 61.4% had CTP-C, 33.0% had CTP- B and 5.7% had CTP-A score.  Conclusion: This study provides a valuable snapshot of the potential association between platelet count and the severity of chronic liver disease. The prevalence of thrombocytopenia across different disease stages underscores its clinical relevance. The platelet count is decreased in chronic liver disease, however, it cannot be defined as the sole predictor for the severity of CLD.",International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24aug587', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24aug587?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24aug587, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

54cd3611df59fffffc15c9b9b5d5b204d547145e,Use of Multi-Tier Concept Diagnostic Tests in Biology Education: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"This study aimed to comprehensively examine the articles in which multi-tier concept diagnostic tests, which are among the alternative assessment methods frequently used in recent years to identify misconceptions, were used in biology education between 2000 and 2022. For this purpose, systematic review steps were followed and summarized in the PRISMA diagram. In this process, four databases (Web of Science, SCOPUS, ERIC, and TR Index) were searched, articles were downloaded, elimination/inclusion criteria were applied, and the full texts of the remaining 71 articles were examined in detail. These articles were analyzed in terms of test type, year of publication, country of application, study group and number of participants, validity and reliability analysis, number of questions in the test and question types according to the test type, and it was revealed which subjects of biology they focused on. As a result of the analysis, it was seen that two-tier tests are mostly used in biology education (62%), followed by three-tier (30%) and four-tier tests (8%). It was seen that the reviewed articles were administered in a total of 21 countries. The subjects of the articles were grouped under 11 themes and 53 codes. Although they are new to the literature and have high validity and reliability, it was seen that especially four-tier concept diagnostic tests were rarely used in biology education. In this context, it was recommended to expand the use of four- and five-tier concept diagnostic tests in biology education.",Journal of Education in Science Environment and Health,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.55549/jeseh.755?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.55549/jeseh.755, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4cdf442bb189cfc30c90e783c2cfef13808b2620,Historical development of electron swarm physics based on the Boltzmann equation towards in-depth understanding of a low-temperature collisional plasma,"
 Theoretical study of the electron kinetics (i.e., the velocity distribution and the transport parameter) in gases is generally conducted using the electron Boltzmann equation. The year 2022 marked 150 years since the formulation of the Boltzmann equation. Even in the last several decades, the historical progress has been made synchronously with the development of innovative technologies in gaseous electronics and in combination with the appearance of computers with sufficient speed and memory. Electron kinetic theory based on the Boltzmann equation has mostly been developed as the swarm physics in the hydrodynamic regime in the dc and rf electric fields. In particular, the temporal characteristics are understood in terms of the collisional relaxation times between electron and gas molecule. There are two main theoretical approaches based on the Boltzmann equation for finding the velocity distribution. One is the traditional description of the electron kinetics, starting from the Boltzmann statistics in velocity space under a uniform density or a small density gradient of electrons. The other most recent approach is based on the phasespace tracking of the velocity distribution where the electron transport parameter is given by the moment of the electron density distribution in position space. In the present paper, we will explore the historical development of the electron Boltzmann equation with respect to three key items: collision term, solution method, and intrinsic electron transport in a hydrodynamic regime involved as the key elements in the low-temperature collisional plasma. The important topics listed in a table are briefly noted and discussed.",Plasma Sources Science & Technology,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1361-6595/ad75b6?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6595/ad75b6, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e800f729d2c1909eac51097442348eaa2cdb8ad1,Digital Campus as a tool for teaching English in the era of digital education,"                Introduction. The digital transformation of higher education in Russia has caused the need to revise the approaches to language training of university graduates.                Aim. The present research aimed to model a Digital Campus with its services and functions as a tool for language training of students in the era of digital transformation of education.                Methodology and research methods. The strategic approach was employed as the leading methodological approach, which in the framework of this study is considered as a potential possibility to implement language education at the university using the “Digital Campus” as an important tool for digital transformation of universities. The research was conducted in three stages, involving 2–3 year students of Togliatti State University (113 participants) and school students of Togliatti (157 participants) from July 2022 to January 2023. Empirical research methods were used: analysis, comparison, generalisation, synthesis, modelling. Stage 1 – collection and analysis of the information presented on the websites of the universities in order to highlight the indicators of the digital development of universities. Stage 2 – a survey of schoolchildren to identify their attitude to university admission; a survey of students to determine their motivation to receive language training through digital tools. Stage 3 – modelling of a Digital Campus, its services and functions for students’ language training.                Results. The authors defined the Digital Campus as an environment based on information and educational digital resources and technologies, computer equipment, telecommunication technologies and software, organisational and methodological support, connecting participants in the learning process (teachers, applicants and students, graduates, enterprises/businesses) for distant educational activities and business operations in accordance with personalised request. The data available on universities’ websites were analysed and grouped into seven indicators. The most represented are the services: additional professional education, the use of interactive forms to work with applicants, online support of student and graduate career development, and the project office. Services for the implementation of personalised educational tracks and the digital footprints accumulation during the learning process were less prominent in the course of the research. The results of the survey were the following: there was a general readiness for “applicant – university” interaction through the online environment; a small percentage of divergence of schoolchildren and student opinion regarding their expectations to learn a foreign language online was observed. The Digital Campus and its functions were modelled. Each of the campus services – a student personal account (applicants/students), a teacher personal account, and an employer personal account (enterprises/businesses) – has its own interface and access to the following functional units: “Recruitment and Project System”, “Language Courses”, “Course Designer”, “Resource Management”, “E-Learning System”, “Courses Expertise Centre”. The environment creates unified information and educational space for student language training.                Scientific novelty. The approaches to understanding the digital transformation of higher education were systematised, and the indicators of higher education institutions use of digital solutions in the educational process were analytically presented. The article provides the authors’ definition of the Digital Campus. The theoretical significance of the article is in the outline and analytical presentation of existing approaches and trends in the digital transformation of higher education.                Practical significance. The Digital Campus is an important tool for the implementation of language training and, unlike the common university website, allows real-time interaction between all participants in the educational process: universities – students – enterprises/businesses. The prospects for the study may be aimed at the development of a Digital Campus for engineering students.",The Education and science journal,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.edscience.ru/jour/article/download/3486/1205', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17853/1994-5639-2024-1-171-201?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17853/1994-5639-2024-1-171-201, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This exploration focuses on a bibliometric-based study using computer-assisted software tools known as VOS viewer and RStudio in analyzing the Scopus data retrieved package for the key phrase of ""Renewable energy"" in the article titles published from 2002 to 2022. A total of 661 publications (which is only 0.45% and 6.3% of the global and continental publications from Africa respectively) were analysed after refining using different bibliometric criteria like study site, type of document, publication stage, language used in the document, and publication time interval. The results shows that Energy fuels, engineering, technology, environmental sciences, ecology, and business economics are the most frequently studied fields. Also, from a total of 661 publications, only 32 documents were published from Tanzania for 20 years from 2022 which is less than 2 publication/year.

Therefore, it is inconceivable that robots will not affect the field of education either. Robot simulators can help developers test and improve intelligent systems before putting them in natural environments. In this study, the use of robots in education has been discussed in relation to the development of metacognitive abilities. A simulation environment was prepared for testing and developing the methods that follow learning models in human–robot interaction. The simulation is about a humanoid robot making an engineering lesson plan. It has been tested on a group of academicians consisting of 64 (32 persons in the experimental group and 32 persons in the control group) persons working in Computer Engineering in the 2021–2022 academic year. The application process includes an 8‐week course period. The data as the result of the test were collected from both groups using the MCQ‐30 scale and from the experimental group by the metacognitive strategy questions after preparing the engineering lesson plans made by robot simulation.

It is believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent and is one of the oldest cultivated legumes in the world. The field experiment was carried out to during kharif season of the year 2022 at departmental farm of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, College of Agriculture, Latur. The experiment was laid out in randomized block design with three replications and eight treatments viz., T1 (RDF), T2 (RDF + Foliar application of humic acid @ 0.2 % at 20 & 35 DAS), T3 (RDF + soil application of humic acid @ 10 kg ha-1), T4 (RDF + soil application of humic acid @ 15 kg ha-1), T5 (RDF + soil application of humic acid @ 20 kg ha-1), T6 (T3 + foliar application of humic acid @ 0.2% at 20 & 35 DAS), T7 (T4 + foliar application of humic acid @ 0.2% at 20 & 35 DAS), T8 (T5 + foliar application of humic acid @ 0.2% at 20 & 35 DAS). The field study indicated that the nutrient uptake and content  and grain and straw yield of black gram crop were significantly influenced due to soil and foliar application of humic acid and RDF. The uptake of N, P and K  were recorded at harvest. Significant and maximum uptake of  N, P and K were noticed with application of treatment T8 (RDF + soil application of humic acid @ 20 kg ha-1+ foliar application of humic acid @ 0.2% at 20 and 35 DAS), whereas the T1 (RDF) showed least values. grain and straw yield significantly affected due to T8 (RDF + soil application of humic acid @ 20 kg ha-1 + foliar application of humic acid @ 0.2% at 20 and 35 DAS) and the lowest grain and straw yield were recorded in T1 (RDF). Thus, it can be concluded that the soil and foliar application of humic acid increase the nutrient uptake and grain and straw yield. The significantly superior result recorded by treatment T8 (RDF + soil application of humic acid @ 20 kg ha-1 + foliar application of humic acid @ 0.2% at 20 and 35 DAS) next to this treatment T7 (RDF + soil application of humic acid @ 10 kg ha-1 + foliar application of humic acid @ 0.2% at 20 and 35 DAS) was best option.

bced97fbe169419c68f3d59d0aaca7babac131df,Effect of Graded Levels of Phosphorus & Phosphorus Solubilizing Microorganisms on Growth and Yield of Green Gram (Vigna radiata L.),"The present investigation entitled ""Effect of Graded Levels of Phosphorus and Phosphorus Solubilizing Microorganisms on Growth and Yield of Green gram"" during kharif season of the year, 2022-2023 at the research farm of the Department of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, College of Agriculture, Latur. The experiment was layout in FRBD with three replications and a recommended variety of green gram BM 2003-2 as a test crop along with twelve treatments. The results in nutshell indicated that the growth and yield were significantly influenced by the application of 125% RDP, combined with Aspergillus awamori. The growth parameters viz., plant height, number of leaves & no. of nodules plant-1, significantly increased with application of 125 % RDP, combined with Aspergillus awamori. The combined approach of incorporating phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms, particularly Aspergillus awamori, with the application of 125% RDP, resulted in a noteworthy increase in the availability of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in the soil. This improvement was attributed to the enhanced solubilization of inorganic phosphorus and the secretion of organic acids, which facilitated an increase in the content of other essential nutrients in the soil.

Using the interviews and focus group discussions, this study aims at finding out the students’ experience, perception and challenges relating to their English accent. Ten male and twenty female students from the socio culturally and linguistically diverse school in Cotabato City Division volunteered for the study, offering information on the socio cultural, educational, and psychological aspects affecting their ESL learning during the academic year 2022-2023. The study shows that low students’ interactions in English beyond the classroom, the preferred use of students’ native language patterns, and inadequate amounts of exposure to English contexts are specific socio-cultural factors. Learning difficulties include; the imbalance in teachers’ competency, instruction, and teaching methods, and student supplies. On the psychological level, students have anxiety, unstable motivation, and problems with self-efficacy, which provides a meaningful addition to learners’ difficulties. Thus, this study recommended the need to tackle these challenges by increasing the training of teachers, developing quality teaching and learning materials, and providing effective learning conditions. These include promotion of English in contextual setting, computer aided instruction, offering counseling and psychological services to boost the learners’ morale.

The primary host plant castor and secondary host plants such as kesseru, tapioca, gulancha and papaya were utilized in various combinations for different instars. Methods: The present analysis was conducted in lab at Department of Entomology, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India during spring season of the year 2022-23. SEM/EDX was used to investigate the cocoons metal elements. Each sample was examined separately to evaluate metal content. Conductive carbon tape attached specimens to stubs. The metal elemental analysis of the scaffold was performed by EDX attached to the scanning electron microscope. Result: For silk cocoon inner surfaces, the metal elements were ordered as follows: C greater than O greater than Mo greater than K greater than Cl greater than Ca greater than Si greater than Na greater than Mg greater than Al. Some Eri cocoons were produced on different host plants and had somewhat different exteriors, but all had evenly distributed components. C and O were abundant on all silk cocoons’ inner and outer surfaces. Cocoons produced on many host plants have higher chemical metal element levels on their exterior and interior surfaces than those raised on a single host plant. The study suggests that chemical factors have a role in silk cocooning, encouraging the creation of β-sheet structure.",Agricultural Science Digest - A Research Journal,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18805/ag.d-6143?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18805/ag.d-6143, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Some factors are responsible for ESA response included genetic predisposition. This review aimed to summarize variant genetics of HIF1α, ACE I/D, STIM1, ORAI1, and TMPRSS6 that are associated with EPO resistance in hemodialysis patients 
Materials and Methods Seven databases were searched through Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Proquest, Science Direct, Wiley, and EBSCOhost to identify potential articles. The year of publication ranges from 2012 to 2022. The study included dialysis patients who defined measures for the erythropoietin resistance index (ERI), body weight, and hemoglobin (Hb). Synthesis is done by grouping according to thematic analysis for elaborative results. 
Results and Discussion There are 2,712 articles in the initial registration, 7 articles met the eligible criteria. There were four studies about polymorphism of the ACE I/D gene, one study about minor alleles of STIMI and ORAI 1, one study about TMPRSS6, and one article study about HIF1α. ACE I/D polymorphisme showed some different effect, but patient with I/D allele tend to have lower Hb. STIM1 was associated with a lower risk of EPO resistance and ORAI1 was also associated with a higher risk of EPO resistance. The TMPRSS6 736V variant is associated with higher hepcidin levels in chronic hemodialysis patients. 
Conclusion These study showed many genetic variants affect the success of EPO therapy with different mechanisms. Genetic variants recognized earlier than therapy may help predict the effectiveness and efficiency of EPO therapy.

A comprehensive analysis of the dataset was conducted using a combination of the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model for named entity recognition, social network analysis for examining interdisciplinary interactions, and descriptive statistics for characterizing the distribution and trends of alt-ac positions. The results reveal that alt-ac positions account for 48.3% of the total demand in the field, distributed across nine categories: academic research institutions, government departments, military organizations, public libraries, and others. Each category exhibits unique developmental patterns. Over 20 distinct alt-ac roles were identified, such as data librarians, competitive intelligence specialists, transformative OA agreement negotiators, and scholarly communication experts, highlighting the ongoing emergence of new positions in response to institutional evolution. Descriptive statistics showed that the demand for alt-ac positions was notably concentrated in economically advanced regions, with the East China region accounting for 32.58% of the total positions, surpassing the proportions in North China (26.22%) and South China (13.86%). Social network analysis revealed substantial interdisciplinary interactions between LIS and other areas, such as computer science and public administration, suggesting potential opportunities for collaboration and competition. The findings emphasize the growing significance of alt-ac in China’s LIS field and provide insights into the dynamic landscape of the academic job market, offering implications for LIS education and workforce development strategies.",Journal of Librarianship and Information Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/09610006241264825?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/09610006241264825, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Study design A systematic review guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Data collection/extraction methods A team of master’s and Ph.D.-level researchers screened eligible studies against the inclusion criteria and extracted the data using COVIDENCE software in pairs with consensus performed by a senior member of the team. Barriers and facilitators were extracted and analyzed according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Frequency of determinants across studies was mapped according to CFIR, valence, study design, delivery setting, unit of analysis, population of interest, region of the U.S., and year. Results We identified 1,739 implementation and innovation determinants from 186 articles. Most determinants were for HIV testing rather than linkage-to-care. Most determinants were identified in the inner setting and individuals domains of CFIR, with the fewest identified in the process and innovations domains. Determinants of providers were only slightly more frequently identified than determinants of recipients. However, determinants of organizations and systems were rarely identified. Conclusion This review provides a synthesis of innovation and implementation determinants of HIV testing and linkage-to-care using the most-cited implementation science (IS) framework, CFIR. This synthesis enables the larger field of HIV science to utilize IS in efforts to end the HIV epidemic and positions IS to consider the application of IS frameworks to fields like HIV.

0fa9245fce67e2b4a5af8a2f1623e87673625ac7,IMPLEMENTASI MODEL PROBLEM BASED LEARNING TERINTEGRASI STEM UNTUK MENINGKATKAN KEMAMPUAN LITERASI MATEMATIS,"The results of the 2015 PISA survey show that students' mathematical literacy in Indonesia is still low, in the field of mathematics it shows that Indonesia is ranked 62nd out of 72 countries. The problem of low mathematical literacy is caused by low interest in learning about the learning model used. This research aims to determine the increase in mathematical literacy skills through an integrated problem-based learning (PBL) model of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The research method used was quasi experiment. The population in this research were two classes of students from class XI in one upper secondary school, in the even semester of the 2022/2023 academic year. The research results show that learning with the STEM integrated PBL model is able to improve students' mathematical literacy skills. This can be seen from the average N-Gain in the experimental class of 0.68 in the medium category, while the control class obtained an average N-Gain of 0.22 in the low category. The average N-Gain is supported by the results of the independent sample t-test hypothesis test, with a Sig (2-tailed) value of 0.00 < 0.05, meaning that the students' mathematical literacy abilities are significantly different from those in the control class.

Methods: Using keywords and identification numbers, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for all publications affiliated with JUST from 1987-2022. The retrieved data was imported, cleaned, visualized, and analyzed using stataIC 16, Excel 395 software, and VOSviewer software. The bibliometric analyses were conducted for types of publications, year of publications, type of journals, faculties, departments, faculty members, and most cited publications. Networking analyses were also conducted for international collaboration and keyword analysis using VOSviewer. Univariable and multivariable Poisson regression models were conducted to estimate the impact of several bibliometric factors on citation numbers. Results: A total of 16,830 publications were affiliated with JUST and published between 1986 and 2022. The total number of citations was 330,046. The average citation per publication was 19.6 and the institutional h-index was 165. Most publications were original articles (81.8%) and 71.7% were published in traditional (non-open) journals. Publication and citation numbers increased steadily, until 2013, and then exponentially, afterward. ? The Faculty of Engineering had the highest number of total publications (4,593), while the Faculty of Medicine had the highest number of total citations (148,384). Professor Yousef S. Khader ranks first as JUST's influential faculty? with 640 publications and 110,777 citations. Factors contributing to higher incidence rate for citations include years since publication, indexing in Scopus and WoS, reviews, publication in open-access journals, and collaboration. Network analysis revealed significant clusters of authors and keywords, with strong connections to the United States and Saudi Arabia. Conclusion: The productivity nd impact of JUST publications have improved annually for all faculties and departments. ?However, this improvement seems to be limited and can be explained by several factors.

The research was prepared according to the qualitative research method. Content analysis method was used to analyze the obtained data. In accordance with the purpose of the research, primary school 1st, 2nd and 3rd Grade Life Sciences textbooks prepared for the 2022-2023 academic year were examined. The findings obtained from the research were divided into themes and tables were created in line with the themes obtained for each grade level. The findings obtained were supported by relevant visuals. As a result of the research, the most findings about environmental awareness were found in 3rd grade Life Science books, that is, the issue of environmental awareness was mentioned mostly in 3rd grade books. The most findings from the 3rd grade book belong to the visual field theme. The class with the least findings regarding environmental awareness is the 1st grade Life Sciences books. In the 1st grade Life Sciences books, where there were the least findings, the area where the most findings were obtained was again the visual area. In the light of the findings obtained in the research, it can be said that the Life Sciences books taught in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd grades of primary school are not sufficient to provide students with environmental awareness. When all the books at these three levels are examined, all themes other than the visual field have not been sufficiently processed and emphasized. At the same time, no activity was found in the books examined that would raise students to the practical level of environmental awareness. Depending on the findings obtained from the research, our suggestions include that the prepared life sciences textbooks should be rearranged on the subject of ""environmental awareness and sensitivity"" and include activities that will raise the students to the application level, and that these activities should be treated as a common theme not only in the life sciences book but in all courses.

This study aimed to determine the significant relationship of the parental support and students’ academic performance in Dao Elementary School, Sta. Josefa District during the academic year of 2022-2023. Specifically, this study sought to determine the level of engagement of parents on the school activities, attitude of parents toward school activities, and academic performance of the students in Math; English; and Science. The study was conducted to 130 parents and 148 learners. The descriptive survey method of research was employed using a modified questionnaire for gathering the data. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance and Pearson coefficient correlation were the statistical tools used to analyze the data. The results revealed that attitude towards school activities with an overall mean rating is 3.92 (SD=0.85) and is described as Strongly Agree, on parental engagement was not significant because it is greater than the significant value of 0.05 while English subject got 87.08. These respondents viewed their support in their children’s education is an integral component to the success of their children. They are aware that their responsibilities go beyond feeding and raising their children also to give a good access to quality education. Parental Engagement had a significant relationship on the academic performances of the students in English and Science but not in Math. There can be other factors that have significant bearing to their academic performance in these areas. This includes students’ motivation, peer influence, home and learning environment. Elementary learners are not mature enough to do well in their studies and are more goal-oriented even with or without full parental support. It is recommended that school administrators and stakeholders should continue in strengthening their relationships for the betterment of students and the community in general.

Descriptive (frequency, percentage and mean) and inferential statistics (Pearson r and ANOVA) were utilized for the analysis and interpretation of data. Major results showed that teacher-respondents utilized in the study have doctorate units, teaching science subject, with few seminars/trainings attended related to classroom assessment, they have more than enough teaching experiences. The teacher-respondents perceived they were very skillful in using classroom assessment. The teacher-respondents perceived they had always done classroom assessment practices and often utilized traditional and authentic assessment. There was no significant difference on the perceived level of agreement of teacher-respondents with the use of classroom assessment skills. There was no significant difference on the perceived level of agreement of teacher-respondents with the use of classroom assessment skills. There was a significant difference on the use of classroom assessment tools among secondary school teachers. There was a significant relationship on the use of classroom assessment skills and the classroom assessment practices. There was a significant relationship between the utilization of assessment tools and the classroom assessment skills. In light of the findings, it is recommended that the teacher may use the findings of the pretest to alter and update instructions before a unit of study, determine which pupils need additional practice, and adapt and revise instructions as needed. Teachers may utilize classroom assessment skills and practices to check on students' comprehension of ideas and a variety of assessment tools, including traditional and authentic assessment to obtain evidence on students' learning. School administrators should work with other stakeholders and ensure that teachers are sent for in-service training or workshops in assessment on a regular basis to make certain that they maintain current classroom assessment skills. Department of Education and curriculum planners may provide teachers with more comprehensive assessment tools to address the needs of students who are at risk of falling behind and equip teachers with traditional and authentic assessment tools to measure a broader variety of competencies.

03e82bfb1474272082b39a528307946de65e4b6a,Impact of a self-defense and self-assertion course on self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women,"Introduction & Purpose
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines violence as “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation” (World Health Organization, 2002, p. 5). There are different types of violence: physical, somatic or bodily violence, psychological, psychic or emotional violence, sexual violence, and violence involving deprivation or neglect (World Health Organization, 2002).
The number of violent crimes across Austria rose by 16.9% in 2022 compared to the previous year, to 78,836 reports (Bundesministerium für Inneres, 2023). According to Statista (2024), Austria ranked sixth out of a total of 27 European countries in terms of the relative number of people affected by rape in 2021, with women affected 9.2 times more frequently than men (37.8 vs. 4.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively). Austria ranked the same across Europe (out of 28 countries) with regard to the rate of female victims of intentional homicide, with a total of 0.98 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants (Europäisches Institut für Gleichstellungsfragen, 2022).
Robust psychological differences between women and men, so-called gender gaps, have been shown in literature. One gender gap, which has been systematically researched since the 1990s and which can still be found across cultures, is the lower self-esteem and self-confidence of girls and women compared to boys and men (Casale, 2020). This gender gap can in turn lead to inequalities in social status and salary (Righetti et al., 2020).
Psychological characteristics again appear to play an important role in violence. Indeed, Fazzone et al. (2000) identified personal protective factors, which include characteristics such as self-confidence, self-reliance, self-motivation, flexibility, and self-assurance, against community and interpersonal violence in home health care.
Scientific studies have shown the effectiveness of self-defense courses on psychological characteristics such as self-confidence and assertiveness of participants (Brecklin, 2008; Gidycz & Dardis, 2014). In particular, most of the self-defense training programs that were analyzed showed positive changes in the measured psychological characteristics, although these results were not always consistent (Brecklin, 2008). In addition, supposed important characteristics such as self-confidence and self-assurance were not measured in the majority of cases (Brecklin, 2008). It is also worth mentioning that these older studies are mostly unpublished dissertations and, in accordance with Brecklin (2008), measures used should be revised to better fit the specific situational goals of self-defense training. This means that rather than just measuring assertiveness in everyday situations, it would be interesting to measure the likelihood of participants using assertiveness techniques in potential assault situations (Brecklin, 2008).
The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate possible effects of a self-defense and self-assertion course (SSC) on self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women when being put into potential assault situations.
Methods
A quasi-experimental study was conducted with voluntary adult female participants in a two-day SSC lasting a total of 10 hours, along with adult female controls who also took part in the study. Inclusion criteria were female gender, age ≥ 18 years, fluency in German (reading and writing), and written informed consent. Participants who had taken part in a SSC or had been practicing martial arts/ combat sports within the 3 months before or during the surveyed period were excluded from the study. The participants were asked about the effects of the SSC as well as the control period using a standardized online questionnaire that complies with the ethical standards of the Department of Sports Science at the University of Innsbruck (certificate of good standing, 25/2006). The survey was conducted at two different times: directly before the start and directly after the end of the SSC (or before and after the simultaneous control period). The questionnaire in German language, which was developed based on relevant literature (Brecklin, 2008; Kidder et al., 1983), included both quantitative and qualitative variables such as open questions. Among other things, the participants were asked to imagine themselves in situations in which they were exposed to different forms as well as intensities of violence and to indicate their level of self-confidence and self-assurance in these situations. A visual analogue scale ranging continuously from 0 (does not apply at all) to 100 (applies completely) was used for this purpose. The SSC took place in the city of Innsbruck (Austria) at various educational institutions between May 2019 and February 2020. The program of the SSC was standardized and included physical defense techniques such as punching, pushing, and kicking techniques (~15%), protective postures, and liberation techniques (~50%), as well as theoretical inputs, exercises for setting boundaries, case studies, and role plays (~35%). Participants of the control group were free in choosing their activities during the control period, however, the participation neither in a SSC nor in martial arts/ combat sports was allowed.
Data are presented as means ± standard deviations. After checking for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test) and for homogeneity (Levene-Test), t-tests for independent samples were applied to check for differences between means of the change score of the assessed parameters of the two samples. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 29 women took part in the study: 18 in the intervention group (IG, 40.0 ± 12.4 years) and 11 in the control group (CG, 30.5 ± 9.9 years). The age difference between the groups was not significant. The results indicate that women in the IG showed significant changes in several parameters compared to those in the CG, particularly when being put into situations in which they were exposed to different forms and intensities of violence. Accordingly, higher self-confidence and self-assurance were evident in the case of severe physical violence as well as in the case of mild psychological violence and higher self-assurance was shown in the case of severe psychological violence (Figure 1). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to mild physical violence or mild and severe sexual violence. Furthermore, the assessment of the open questions with regard to the organization of the SSC and the program offered suggests that the courses were very well received by the participants.
Discussion
The study shows that a relatively short SSC leads to a higher increase of both self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women, both in situations of physical and psychological violence, compared to the control group. No significant differences between the groups were found with regard to situations of sexual violence, which is presumably due to the framework conditions of the courses (with only female participants). Therefore, future studies evaluating the impact of SSC on self-confidence and self-assurance of women exposed to sexual violence should include practice with male training partners. Additionally, in the interest of sustainability, it is important to achieve long-term changes in attitudes and behavior, which should be the goal of future research.
The study’s limitations that should be considered include the lack of an a priori power analysis, the absence of random group allocation, the missing standardization and supervision of the activity of the control group, the use of non-validated single-item scales, possible bias due to the overestimation of effects because of the temporal proximity of the survey to the SSC, and the failure to account for confounding variables such as age, which however did not differ significantly between groups.
Conclusion
Since violence is often perpetrated against women, particularly in Austria, and since women show less self-confidence and self-assurance than men, the promotion of high-quality SSC lasting at least 10 hours can be recommended to women in order to strengthen these resources.

The study population consisted of 203 students studying at Bartın University, Faculty of Sports Sciences, Department of Physical Education and Sports in the 2022-2023 academic year. The sample of the study comprised 165 volunteer students (98 male and 67 female) selected through a simple random sampling method. Data were collected using a personal information form for the candidates, the ""Attitude Toward the Teaching Profession Scale (ATTPS)"" and ""Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)"". The collected data were analyzed using frequency, percentage distribution, and arithmetic mean, as well as independent sample t-test and the pearson correlation analyses. The SPSS 26.0 software package was employed for data analysis. The study results revealed a significant difference in the mean total scores of ATTPS and SWLS based on the t-test results of the active engagement in sports variable (p<0.05). Regarding the family income variable, the correlation analysis indicated a moderate and positive significant relationship with mean SWLS total scores, while no significant relationship was found with mean ATTPS total scores (p<0.05). Similarly, for the leisure time variable, a moderate and positive significant relationship was identified with mean SWLS total scores, but no significant relationship was observed with mean ATTPS total scores (p<0.05). Moreover, a low and positive significant relationship was noted between ATTPS and SWLS (p<0.05). In conclusion, the study suggests that as physical education and sports teacher candidates' attitudes toward the teaching profession increase, their levels of satisfaction with life are likely to rise. Simultaneously, an increase in satisfaction with life may contribute to a higher level of positive attitude toward the teaching profession.",International Journal of Sport Culture and Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.14486/intjscs.2024.717', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.14486/intjscs.2024.717?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.14486/intjscs.2024.717, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Disputes cause conflicts and can lead to divorce. Kediri Regency ranks sixth for the highest divorce rate in the East Java region and has shown an increasing trend over the last five years, from 2018 to 2022. This study aims to determine the impact of emotional maturity on marital harmony among young adults in Kediri Regency. The research was conducted using quantitative methods. The measuring instruments included an emotional maturity scale and a marital harmony scale. The emotional maturity scale showed a reliability value of 0.935, while the marital harmony scale scored 0.908, indicating a high coefficient level for both scales. The study included 100 participants who met the criteria of being aged between 20 and 40 years, being married, and having a minimum of one year of marriage. A purposive sampling technique was used for participant selection. The data was analyzed using simple linear regression analysis. Based on the results of the hypothesis test, it shows that the significance value is 0.000, which shows that emotional maturity has a significant influence on marital harmony, and the R square value is 80%. This study implies that for young adult couples, creating a harmonious family through marriage requires both husband and wife to possess high emotional maturity.

The purpose of the study: to identify patterns of clinical manifestations of central nervous system lesions in children with neuroinfections. Materials and methods The cases of neuroinfections in 101 children treated at the “City Clinical Infectious Diseases Hospital” (Shymkent) in the period from 2018 to 2022 were analyzed, of which 37 patients with viral neuroinfections, 64 with bacterial ones. Results The predominance of bacterial neuroinfections over viral ones was revealed, with a predominance among young boys. Headache or its equivalents (in children under one year old) were observed in 72.5%; most often in children with viral infections of the nervous system (81.2%), less often in patients with bacterial infections (65.4%), p 0.01. In most cases, the disease manifested with the phenomena of fever and vomiting. When assessing the neurological status, the duration of preservation of two frequently occurring meningeal signs (rigidity of the occipital muscles, Kernig’s symptom) was taken into account, which was 6 ± 1.3 days and 5 ± 1.1 days in the group with bacterial neuroinfections, and 4 ± 1.8 and 5 ± 1.7 days, respectively, in the group with viral neuroinfections (p 0.05). With pneumococcal etiology, the most severe and protracted cases of the course of neuroinfections are recorded. Frequent emergency conditions in infectious lesions of the central nervous system in the form of cerebral edema, septic shock, which occur more often in bacterial neuroinfections, have been identified. Conclusion Neuroinfections are characterized by a symptom complex of clinical manifestations, which should be interpreted by doctors in a timely and correct manner in order to diagnose early and minimize adverse outcomes of the disease.

ba644bb9add2f11b82bc3a272af2573ef1144154,Introducing the Life Sciences Innovation Case Study Project,"This Issue of the Berkeley Technology Law Journal presents the results from an ambitious and broad pilot study of the institutions, funders, patent, and regulatory regimes that shape biomedical innovation. This study relies on a comparative analysis of real-world case study examples of breakthrough inventions in the life sciences ecosystem to facilitate evidence-based policy recommendations for allocation of scarce IP, regulatory, and funding resources grounded in real life sciences inventive pathways. Over the 2022–23 academic year, students enrolled in Berkeley Law’s Life Sciences & Innovation Workshop drafted the five case studies published in this Issue. The case studies range from small-molecule therapeutics (Lyrica, Truvada, and Spravato) to biological products (Yescarta) and platform technologies (next-generation sequencing). In each case study, the author examined the scientific background, development history, and innovation “drivers” and “impediments” that led to successful commercialization of the invention. This Article describes the methodology used to develop each case study and provides key comparative insights on the innovation drivers and impediments most critical to successful commercialization for these examples. Even at this preliminary stage of the project, the case studies highlight the importance of early-stage serendipitous discovery and the key role of the Bayh-Dole Act in facilitating later-stage commercialization efforts—whether through startup companies or large pharmaceutical companies. The case studies also illustrate the incentive structures that IP rights create for manufacturers and the important role of the U.S. regulatory framework in shaping innovation. And several case studies highlight ethical, moral, and political considerations that helped to develop environments conducive to scientific research. Expanding the case study universe in future work will lead to further development of the evidence-based policies and resource allocations offered here—and identification of additional policies to advance life science innovation.",Social Science Research Network,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/ssrn.4895700?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4895700, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

28fcad008483c60b8ae08f9530e6923488eccd42,Enhancing Taxonomic Skills in West Africa and Supporting the Growth of GC Herbarium (Ghana),"Training the next generation of environmental scientists is critical to the future of life on Earth as acknowledged in 2021 by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG, Kew) in Our Manifesto for Change. RBG, Kew is also committed to strengthening capacity in the most biodiverse tropical countries by sharing expertise and collections, to enhance the global conservation effort. Developing training programmes to enhance taxonomic capacity in Africa and meeting the demand for early career in-country taxonomists was identified as the first step to accelerate the documentation and conservation of African plant diversity.
 Two years ago, RBG, Kew, in collaboration with the University of Ghana and the Ghana Herbarium (GC) and with support from the Schroder Charity Trust and Mallinckrodt Foundation, developed a tailored “Plant Taxonomy Skills for Ecology and Conservation” training course. This was planned to run in Africa, South America and Asia, alternating each year. The pilot was organised in Ghana, Africa in 2022. Participants for this 5-week course were selected from over 260 applicants. Delivered in a hybrid format, the course started with 3 weeks of online lectures, pre-recorded by 15 plant scientists and curators at RBG, Kew, as well as online interactive sessions. This was then followed by 2 weeks of in-person training in Ghana, including a 1-day field trip for practical collecting tips. The training covered herbarium curation techniques as well as concepts and skills needed for taxonomic revisions such as nomenclature, taxonomy, analysis of herbarium specimens, databasing, geo-referencing, preparation of morphological descriptions, diagnosis and identification keys as well as building distribution maps and red listing. The in-country teaching team included a curator-botanist, a plant taxonomist, a science education coordinator from RBG, Kew and two professors from University of Ghana. The course ended with a written assignment in the form of a taxonomic revision. A short survey was sent out to all course participants two years after the course to gather impacts of the training on their careers and uncover the most positive and negative aspects of the course.
 The course provided many positive outcomes: 15 plant taxonomists from eight African countries were trained, and jointly produced a taxonomic revision of 28 species of Ipomoea L. (Convolvulaceae) from Ghana (Williams et al. 2024). Additionally, The African Taxonomists Network was initiated by the course participants with a mission of ‘Fostering the next generation of taxonomists to bridge the generational gap and revitalize the relevance of taxonomy in Africa for the future.’ This network now has over 60 members, meets regularly online, and has a large presence on social media. Furthermore, the course also resulted in the awarding of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) Biodiversity Challenge grant to the GC Herbarium in 2022. This grant enabled acquiring essential plant collecting equipment and herbarium materials, either by sourcing them in Ghana or from abroad. The GC herbarium, founded in 1952, contains ~85,000 collections of plant and algae specimens from Ghana and across West Africa with high historical, teaching and research value. This collection is vital to enhancing in-country taxonomic capacity. Therefore, the improvement and upgrade supported by the grant, as well as its recognition, are essential. Another rewarding impact of the course is strengthening of links between RBG, Kew and African institutions of higher education. These links have quickly developed into a larger partnership and were the first step towards a long-term collaboration. The ultimate objective of this collaboration has been to create the necessary conditions, both in infrastructure and human capacity to deliver the Flora of Ghana. This will be achieved by implementing a project to support the maintenance and growth of the GC herbarium in addition to taxonomic capacity building and teaching.
 The participants benefited from the course by engaging with mentors, networking and exchanging ideas, forming links with individuals with similar research interests and obtaining additional training and career progression opportunities. In the feedback survey, all participants reported that this course made them consider a career or future studies in plant taxonomy and 80% of the participants reported securing a new job or a student position in plant taxonomy two years after the course. In addition, all participants listed several positive impacts of the course on their career such as confidence in producing a taxonomic revision, gaining herbarium management skills and opportunities for new collaborations. This course has been subsequently successfully run in South America (Bolivia) and Asia (Indonesia), with expectations of similarly positive outcomes, and is already planned to return to Africa (Kenya) in 2025.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139237', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.139237?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139237, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

17ccf9bde7a8081e1453e4f951d6cf3a8d43a9c2,ADRs (Adverse Drug Reactions) related to ayurvedic medicine used in COVID-19,"Background: Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended, and which occurs at therapeutic doses. Due to a lack of systematic documentation regarding the occurrence of ADR and other issues to the safety of Ayurvedic medicines, concern about the traditional medical system has recently been increased. This is seen by a rise in safety reports and misunderstandings, especially in the recent pandemic. 
Objective: To monitor and analyse the suspected ADR to Ayurvedic medicines used in COVID-19. 
Materials and Methods: ADR monitoring data was collected through spontaneous and intensive method for a span of 2-year (April 2020 to April 2022) during the peak days of COVID-19 from the IPvCC of the National Institute of Ayurveda, Jaipur, India. The IPvCC Program is governed by NPvCC under the supervision of Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India, New Delhi. NPvCC is ultimately responsible to monitor and recommend regulatory interventions on the generated national ADR data. 
Result: In a span of two-year, 142 adverse drug events were reported out of which 17 were confirmed as ADR due to suspected Ayurvedic drugs. 
Conclusion: Overall review demonstrated that Ayurveda has traditionally been placed a strong emphasis on treatments that aim to heal the underlying illness while preventing the development of new illnesses.

5b52f10160408f1bb076020e6188c102701bb06e,Pig organs in humans: a forum on xenotransplantation,"ABSTRACT What if one of your organs, say, the kidney, the heart or the liver, deteriorates completely, and you are not lucky enough to have a human organ for transplantation? Do you want to receive an organ from a pig? That is not a joke, but a subject some physicians and researchers are working on—a field of research known as ‘xenotransplantation’.In 2022, David Bennett, a 57-year-old patient with terminal heart disease, received a pig heart and survived for 2 months after the surgery. Another recipient, Lawrence Faucette, survived for 40 days after similar surgery in 2023. Then, in 2024, Rick Slayman, the world's first recipient of a pig kidney, passed away 2 months after the surgery. Rick was able to get out of the hospital during these 2 months and the transplant team said there is no indication that his sudden passing was the result of failure of the pig kidney graft. Rather, it was related to his heart disease. In China, a liver xenotransplantation from pig to a brain-dead patient was reported in 2024 and the transplanted liver survived in the human body for as long as 10 days.On April 2024, National Science Review organized a panel discussion on xenotransplantation, which was chaired by Prof. Liangxue Lai and involved six other experts in the field. The panelists had in-depth discussions on xenotransplantation, covering its history and the (i) gene editing of the donor pigs, (ii) immunosuppressive regimens required by the recipients, (iii) challenges in preclinical and clinical research, (iv) relevant ethical issues and (v) prospects for the future of xenotransplantation.

IN SCHOOLCHILDREN ACCORDING TO SCREENING DATA","Aim to assess the prevalence of posture disorders and deforming dorsopathies in schoolchildren in the city of Kazan according to screening data using optical computer topography. 
Materials and methods. As part of the ongoing preventive medical examination of underage students in November-December 2022, a computer topographic examination of 776 schoolchildren (347 girls and 429 boys aged 8.4916.5 years) was conducted in two schools in Kazan, whose parents signed a voluntary informed consent; the study was approved by the local ethical committee of KSMU). To process the obtained data, the proportion of the feature was calculated; confidence intervals for frequencies by the Wilson method. 
Results. According to the results of the study, it was found that 44 (12.68%) girls and 62 (14.45%) boys are practically healthy - they were assigned to the first health group in terms of posture (I-norm; I-subnorm - scoliosis 01st degrees); 251 (72.33%) girls and 300 (69.93%) boys have postural disorders; spinal deformities of moderate severity (scoliosis of the 1st2nd degree and other spinal deformities) were found in 51 (14.7%) girls and 63 (14.69%) boys, and the identified deviations are more common among high school students; scoliosis grade 3 and above was found in one 11-year-old girl, two 12-year-old and two 15-year-old boys (0.29% and 0.93%, respectively). All parents are informed of the screening results; recommendations are given to parents whose children are at risk or who have posture disorders and spinal deformities. 
Conclusion. The frequency of occurrence of posture disorders and deforming dorsopathies in schoolchildren in Kazan does not differ from the average Russian indicators and does not have a statistically significant difference among girls and boys, however, with an increase in the age of schoolchildren, the proportion of moderate spinal deformities increases: among 15-year-old girls - 19.51% (CI 95% 7, 38-31.64); among boys aged 16 - 20.55% (95% CI 11.28-29.82).",Science and Innovations in Medicine,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.35693/sim568492', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.35693/sim568492?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.35693/sim568492, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6c0ffb36fbc89a9c0c6cf061e7fe76379be95d50,"Physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep across lifespan in adults across European countries: Background and design","Introduction 
Regular physical activity (PA) has benefits for health throughout the lifespan. PA benefits musculoskeletal, cardio metabolic health, and overall well-being (Kapoor et al., 2022). However, data from 2017 shows that about 55-83% of women and 47-74% of men from European countries (EU) do not meet these guidelines (Lübs et al,. 2018). Moreover, adults at the age of 40-54 (aOR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52-0.81) and 55-64 (aOR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49-0.77) are less likely to have moderate or high levels of PA in comparison with those 18-24 years of age. (Nikitara et al., 2021). Sedentary behavior (SB) including activities such as watching television, playing computer games, browsing the internet has increased (Wang et al., 2019). Canada has an established track record in the development of 24-hour movement guidelines on PA, SB, and sleep. They have previously release guidelines for all age groups. Following Canada’s lead, several jurisdictions including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa have incorporated the 24-hour movement concepts (Tremblay, 2020).  There is a lack of data for 24-hour behavior guideline in the European context. There are no specific recommendations on SB and sleep. Therefore, this project will present the background, methods and design of a 24-hour movement summary of behaviors (PA, SB and sleep) in Europe. 
Methods 
We will utilize existing PA, SB and sleep data from the World Health Organization on European adults 18+. Analysis using mean, median, and 95% confidence Intervals, will be complemented by frequency distributions and histograms.

675292c847db370df4b0f9a03cfea7d2b889f96a,Insights on mapping Industry 4.0 and Education 4.0,"Introduction The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0 (I.D. 4.0), has radically empowered professionals to revamp skills and technologies, to match ever-evolving industry demands. Education 4.0 (E.D. 4.0) is an integral education framework, strategically designed to align with I.D. 4.0 needs. The present work presents high-level insights on mapping I.D. 4.0 to E.D. 4.0, by successfully analyzing the four key existing components of E.D. 4.0, namely, learning methods, competencies, infrastructure and information and communication technologies (ICT). Methods Research questions are formulated along themes aiming to standardize the E.D. 4.0 framework and identify effectiveness and implementation challenges. These posed questions are addressed by performing an exhaustive bibliometric analysis on the associated literature, by clustering relevant publications by field, year, and geography. We employed the search engines Scopus, Science Direct, and IEEE in a period between January and June of 2022. Results Network maps evidence the implementation of E.D. 4.0 elements with no formal and universally adopted framework to map with I.D. 4.0. There is an increasing interest and support from researchers and education institutions in preparing a skilled workforce for I.D. 4.0. Trends of E.D> 4.0-related published articles reveal more implementation efforts in developed countries compared to developing countries. Discussion Our results demonstrate a lack of any currently existent, standardized, and universally accepted framework for mapping I.D. 4.0 to E.D. 4.0, despite trends showing a sharp rise towards incorporating E.D. 4.0 initiatives recently into university curricula. Our analysis procedure can serve as a protocol to define E.D. 4.0 in a more specific context, in an ever-changing global workspace. While unbalanced implementation attempts on how extensively E.D. 4.0 components have been defined and adopted (including discrepancies in implementation policies among countries, and across disciplines), further rigorous assessments are needed to critically assess the necessary requirements and effectiveness, for standardization and implementation a global mapping framework.",Frontiers in Education,2023.0,16,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2023.1150190/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/feduc.2023.1150190?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2023.1150190, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The aim of this review is to consolidate the recently published case reports of N. fowleri infection by describing its epidemiology and clinical features with the goal of ultimately disseminating this information to healthcare personnel. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and OVID databases until 31 December 2022 by two independent reviewers. All studies from the year 2013 were extracted, and quality assessments were carried out meticulously prior to their inclusion in the final analysis. Results: A total of 21 studies were selected for qualitative analyses out of the 461 studies extracted. The cases were distributed globally, and 72.7% of the cases succumbed to mortality. The youngest case was an 11-day-old boy, while the eldest was a 75-year-old. Significant exposure to freshwater either from recreational activities or from a habit of irrigating the nostrils preceded onset. The symptoms at early presentation included fever, headache, and vomiting, while late sequalae showed neurological manifestation. An accurate diagnosis remains a challenge, as the symptoms mimic bacterial meningitis. Confirmatory tests include the direct visualisation of the amoeba or the use of the polymerase chain reaction method. Conclusions: N. fowleri infection is rare but leads to PAM. Its occurrence is worldwide with a significant risk of fatality. The suggested probable case definition based on the findings is the acute onset of fever, headache, and vomiting with meningeal symptoms following exposure to freshwater within the previous 14 days. Continuous health promotion and health education activities for the public can help to improve knowledge and awareness prior to engagement in freshwater activities.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2023.0,15,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/4/3021/pdf?version=1675929162', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9964342, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Additionally, to determine which of the two approaches is more effective in teaching pupils fundamental football skills. The research community and sample were represented by the first-stage students in the College of Physical Education and Sports Sciences at the University of Babylon for the academic year 2022-2023, numbering (128 students), because these skills selected for education are within the vocabulary of the educational curriculum prescribed for this stage. We chose a sample of (22 students), as (11) students were selected for each group, and those who failed, practiced football, and were not regular in attendance were excluded, as well as what the nature of the research requires in order to simulate the independent variable (playing style). The two experimental groups were determined by (11) students in each group. The first experimental group used the play method with the interaction of the cooperative exercise method, while the second experimental group used the play method with the interaction of the reciprocal exercise method. We used the experimental method for equivalent groups. After processing the data statistically by using the (t) test for the corresponding groups in the skill tests, and the (t) test for independent samples between the two groups. We concluded that the group of the play style combined with cooperative training was more developed than the second experimental group in the skills of passing, put down and rolling.

e42d78839c4fd0aacfe90c326fa698041e8ebedd,Cervical cancer survival prediction by machine learning algorithms: a systematic review,"Background Cervical cancer is a common malignant tumor of the female reproductive system and is considered a leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. The analysis of time to event, which is crucial for any clinical research, can be well done with the method of survival prediction. This study aims to systematically investigate the use of machine learning to predict survival in patients with cervical cancer. Method An electronic search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was performed on October 1, 2022. All articles extracted from the databases were collected in an Excel file and duplicate articles were removed. The articles were screened twice based on the title and the abstract and checked again with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main inclusion criterion was machine learning algorithms for predicting cervical cancer survival. The information extracted from the articles included authors, publication year, dataset details, survival type, evaluation criteria, machine learning models, and the algorithm execution method. Results A total of 13 articles were included in this study, most of which were published from 2018 onwards. The most common machine learning models were random forest (6 articles, 46%), logistic regression (4 articles, 30%), support vector machines (3 articles, 23%), ensemble and hybrid learning (3 articles, 23%), and Deep Learning (3 articles, 23%). The number of sample datasets in the study varied between 85 and 14946 patients, and the models were internally validated except for two articles. The area under the curve (AUC) range for overall survival (0.40 to 0.99), disease-free survival (0.56 to 0.88), and progression-free survival (0.67 to 0.81), respectively from (lowest to highest) received. Finally, 15 variables with an effective role in predicting cervical cancer survival were identified. Conclusion Combining heterogeneous multidimensional data with machine learning techniques can play a very influential role in predicting cervical cancer survival. Despite the benefits of machine learning, the problem of interpretability, explainability, and imbalanced datasets is still one of the biggest challenges. Providing machine learning algorithms for survival prediction as a standard requires further studies.",BMC Cancer,2023.0,16,"{'url': 'https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12885-023-10808-3', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10103471, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a new global mean sea surface (MSS) model, named the Shandong
University of Science and Technology 2020 (SDUST2020), with a grid size of 1′×1′. This new model was established with a 19-year moving
average method and fused multi-satellite altimetry data over a 27-year
period (from January 1993 to December 2019). The data of HaiYang-2A,
Jason-3, and Sentinel-3A were first ingested in the SDUST2020 MSS but not in
any other global MSS model, such as the CLS15 and DTU18 MSS models.
Validations, including comparisons with the CLS15 and DTU18 MSS models,
GPS-leveled tide gauges, and altimeter data, were performed to evaluate the
quality of the SDUST2020 MSS model, all of which showed that the SDUST2020
MSS model is accurate and reliable. The SDUST2020 MSS dataset is freely

There were four workshops in 2020, 11 in 2021, and nine in 2022. The editors and staff of the KCSE’s member institutes participated in these events more actively than before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the number of participants increased. Even before the pandemic, scholarly journal publishing had already been digitalized and implemented online through manuscript management systems (e-submission systems); therefore, the pandemic did not cause operational problems. The number of submissions during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic soared, especially in the medical field [1] and on the topic of COVID-19 itself. Many scientific articles have helped medical professionals care for persons infected with COVID-19. Therefore, scientific journals received a very high level of recognition as a valuable resource for society as a whole during this critical pandemic. I am delighted to see that scientific, technological, and medical journals in Korea have played a pivotal role in combating COVID19, and I am proud to have served as the president of the organization of those journal editors for 3 years.

Yet it remains unknown whether breeding programs have indirectly affected vertical stem dry matter and N allocation. Our objectives were to i) determine the dry matter and N allocations across different stem portions in maize hybrids released from 1980 to 2020 at the start (R2) and end of grain-filling period (R6), and ii) investigate the dry matter and N remobilization patterns by stem portion. We studied 23 Bayer Crop Science hybrids (release year 1980 to 2020) of different relative maturities (short and long maturity) in 2021 and 2022. Stem dry weight, N concentration, and N content by stem portion (four equal-length sections) were measured at R2 and R6 stages. We found that the average vertical distribution of the stem dry matter and N content along the plant height was 8% (top), 17% (middle-top), 29% (middle-bottom), and 46% (bottom). Maize breeding slightly reduced the total stem dry matter and N content at R2 stage in both relative maturities, and this reduction occurred in the top two quarters, with no significant change in the bottom stem portion. At R6 stage, the N content was significantly reduced in long maturity hybrids, and all the stem portions contributed to this reduction. Newer hybrids of both relative maturities remobilized less dry matter than the older hybrids (17 vs 20%) but slightly more N (39 vs 36%). We concluded that maize breeding efforts have indirectly affected vertical stem dry matter allocation towards less stem dry matter above the ear leaf. This change reduces plants’ center of gravity, which could explain why new hybrids are more resistant to lodging and can accommodate high plant densities. This study brings new data and knowledge, which enhances our understanding of indirect breeding consequences on maize plant traits.",Frontiers in Plant Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2025.1514045', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11949881, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In response to this situation, in order to support the achievement of the strategic development goal, an order for the development of higher education and science in the Republic of Kazakhstan has been implemented with the aim of gradually increasing investment in scientific research to 1% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Our assessment of the scientific output of veterinary sciences in Kazakhstan over the five-year period 2018–2023 demonstrated progress. The total investment in veterinary science has increased to 14 billion KZT, i.e., from 2018, the funding of projects has become annual, previously it was once every 3 years. The consequence of this transformation was a 5-fold increase in the number of published articles for example, in 2022–2023 their number reached 50 compared to 2018–2019, where the number was barely 10. Despite the positive trend in veterinary science in recent years there are still gaps in the form of inadequate funding (only 20 funded projects per year with an average allocation of <200,000 USD per project), the productivity of the scientific community has been lower than expected: 91 peer-reviewed publications were published in first quartile journals over 5 years, which is an average of one publication in first quartile journals per year for every 32 PhD researchers (with a total of 584 PhDs), concentration of science only in large cities of Kazakhstan (Astana, Almaty), scientific developments of scientists are not commercialized and have no feedback with production.

21c3b525ae0138951bd88b1d97bda6935ce715ac,Strategic Procurement Practices and Procurement Performance of City Counties in Kenya,"Strategic procurement has been seen to form a bedrock on which institutions’ functionality sits. Good strategic procurement practice has been attributed to positive results of procurement performance. Strategic procurement is important mainly because it enables an organization to clearly define the purpose of the procurement department in the organization. Procurement in the county governments in Kenya is guided by the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act of 2015 and its revised edition of 2016. However, in the financial year 2021/2022, Report of the Auditor-General highlighted a myriad of procurement challenges in major county governments in Kenya. City counties in Kenya faces a myriad of procurement challenges such as lack of inventory records, and payments processed without any reference to local service orders (LSOs), bills of quantities documents, project files, contractor’s invoices, completion certificates from technical departments and inspection and acceptance committee reports. The objective of the study was to establish the influence of strategic procurement practices on procurement performance of City Counties in Kenya. The study was guided by Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, Stewardship Theory, Institutional Theory and Technology Acceptance Theory (TAM). This study adopted correlational research design. The study targeted 56 procurement officers from Nairobi City County, Mombasa City County, Kisumu City County and Nakuru City County. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data. The collected data was coded and entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and version 27 and Python software for quantitative analysis. The data collected was subjected to various diagnostic tests to ensure adherence to the assumptions of regression analysis, thus providing an accurate and reliable prediction of the relationship among the variables. The study elucidated that strategic procurement practices, specifically strategic sourcing, e-procurement, and contract and supplier management, notably enhance procurement performance in city counties. Strategic sourcing was shown to lower costs and improve supplier relations. E-procurement streamlined processes and enhanced transparency, though challenges like resistance to change were noted. Effective contract and supplier management was crucial, directly influencing performance by ensuring supplier compliance and fostering robust relationships. Recommendations include adopting comprehensive sourcing strategies, integrating e-procurement, and maintaining stringent supplier management to improve procurement outcomes. These results and recommendations would be of great benefit to the management and employees in the counties by providing them with insights into procurement practices. The study provides useful, relevant and up to date information on the best procurement practices, limitations and challenges to industry professionals, institutions and suppliers in the procurement practices. The future researchers will also benefit in that they will be able to increase their understanding of the pertinent issues concerning strategic procurement practices.",Social Science Research Network,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/ssrn.5153116?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5153116, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Relational survey model, one of the quantitative research methods, was used in the study. The population of the study consisted of teachers working in primary and secondary schools in Tuşba district of Van province of Turkey in 2022-2023 academic year. The sample group of the study consisted of 430 volunteer teachers determined by ‘stratified sampling’ method, which is one of the non-probability sampling methods. Ethical Leadership Scale, Organisational Cynicism Scale and Teacher Subjective Well-Being Scale were used as data collection tools. The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) statistical programs. As a result of the research, a moderate negative significant relationship was found between school principals ‘ethical leadership behaviours and teachers’ organisational cynicism levels, and a moderate negative significant relationship was found between teachers' organisational cynicism levels and their subjective well-being. In addition, it was determined that there was a significant positive relationship between school principals ‘ethical leadership behaviours and teachers’ subjective well-being. Finally, it was concluded that subjective well-being has a partial mediating role in the relationship between ethical leadership and organisational cynicism. It was concluded that ethical leadership behaviours exhibited by school principals affect teachers' organisational cynicism levels both directly and indirectly through subjective well-being.",Edelweiss Applied Science and Technology,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.55214/25768484.v9i1.4185?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.55214/25768484.v9i1.4185, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Patients in the tacrolimus cohort were treated with 0.03 percent tacrolimus ointment two times daily for 60 days, followed by a single application daily for 60 days, and once on alternate days for the next two months. The control group got topical fluorometholone 0.1% drops in their eyes for two weeks, after which the amount given was gradually lowered for another two weeks. During the subsequent follow-up time frame, both groups received topical olopatadine 0.1% drops for the eyes twice daily. Modifications to symptoms and signs were documented among the groups to measure the success of therapy, and their severity was rated using a four-point scale.Results: During the follow-up period, 60 children with bilateral VKC were observed, and the mean age of both groups was similar. Papillary hypertrophy and conjunctival hyperemia were the most common signs, while itching was the most frequently reported symptom. After treatment, Symptoms and signs decreased significantly in both of the groups. However, at three and six months, the group treated with 0.03 percent tacrolimus ointment showed a more notable improvement in symptom and sign scores. The tacrolimus group tolerated the treatment well, with only a few complaining of a stinging sensation. The control group experienced one incidence of elevated intraocular pressure.Conclusion: 0.03% tacrolimus ointment is an effective and secure therapy for vernal keratoconjunctivitis in young individuals. This different treatment technique may help and lower the likelihood of steroid-related problems in patients with chronic VKC.

quality education for each person. This is especially true for certain specific categories of citizens: people with 
disabilities, educational migrants. The study was aimed at determining, based on an analysis of the admission of 
people with disabilities and educational migrants to universities, which areas of training and specialties were the 
most popular among these categories.
Materials and methods. The study materials were statistical data from the state federal reporting form for 2022: 
No. VPO-1 “Information on the organization performing educational activities under higher education programs 
– bachelor’s degree programs, specialist programs, master’s degree programs” for state higher education 
organizations in terms of full-time education at the beginning of the 2022/23 academic year. The study used 
methods of comparative analysis and descriptive statistics, methods of analysis and synthesis, decision theory, 
mathematical modeling and statistical data analysis.
Results. The maximum values of the share of individuals with disabilities and educational migrants in the total 
admission to universities corresponded to different regions and federal districts: for individuals with disabilities, 
it was the North Caucasus Federal District, for educational migrants – St. Petersburg, Sevastopol, Leningrad and 
Tver regions. The analysis identified 11 most popular areas of training for individuals with disabilities and 16 for 
educational migrants. Five integrated groups of specialties and areas of training (UGSN) could be considered 
the universal all-Russian choice of areas of training and specialties upon admission to universities for these 
categories: 31.00.00 – Clinical Medicine; 09.00.00 – Informatics and Computer Engineering; 44.00.00 – Education 
and Pedagogical Sciences; 38.00.00 – Economics and Management; 40.00.00 – Jurisprudence. For each category 
of applicants, admission formulas had been compiled, which represented the ratio of the number of UGSN from 
the corresponding fields of science.
Discussion and conclusion. A comparative analysis of the general admission to universities showed that for 
individuals with disabilities, the leading areas of admission were UGSN from the field of sciences – sciences 
about society, while for educational migrants these were engineering, technology and technical sciences. In both 
categories, the second most popular area of science was health care and medical sciences. The third position was 
occupied by sciences from the first places of the opposite categories. The least interest among individuals with 
disabilities was paid to UGSN of engineering areas, where training and further work activity were associated with 
greater difficulties.",Perspectives of science and education,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.32744/pse.2024.6.5', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32744/pse.2024.6.5?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32744/pse.2024.6.5, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In order to identify the NTFPs’ financial contribution and usage categories based on regional and temporal patterns in the Horn of Africa countries, we performed a systematic review of 60 papers published between 2010 and 2022. The review used the search terms Non-Timber Forest Product* OR Non- Wood Forest Product*(NWFPs) OR Minor Forest Product in combination with Livelihoods and also Horn of Africa countries to thoroughly search the articles on the Google Scholar, Research4life, Scopus, Science direct, ResearchGate portals, EMBASE, and PubMed databases. The records contained information about the paper’s title, abstract, keywords, authors, country, NTFP income amount, NTFP usage type, and publication year. The recorded data were analyzed using R Studio, IBM SPSS Statistics 26, and Excel 2019. The majority of the research article for this review was done in Ethiopia (45%), Sudan (22%) and Kenya (17%), respectively. According to the review’s findings, NTFPs have a significant impact on rural household income in six nations, the average NTFP overall revenue was 24.41%. There were more than 35 NTFP uses and the source of product in the Horn of African Countries however, Gum Arabic, Food, Firewood, Medicinal plant, and honey were the five NTFP usage types that were used by people and found in almost in all countries of the Horn of Africa.

As indicated by the high proportion of COVID-19 suspicion or diagnosis among patients who had OHCA, this issue could have resulted in multiple fatalities from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurring at home and being counted as OHCA. Methods: We used the MeSH term “heart arrest” as well as non-MeSH terms “out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death, OHCA, cardiac arrest, coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).” We conducted a literature search using these search keywords in the Science Direct and PubMed databases and Google Scholar until 25 April 2022. Results: A systematic review of observational studies revealed OHCA and mortality rates increased considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period of the previous year. A temporary two-fold rise in OHCA incidence was detected along with a drop in survival. During the pandemic, the community’s response to OHCA changed, with fewer bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitations (CPRs), longer emergency medical service (EMS) response times, and worse OHCA survival rates. Conclusions: This study’s limitations include a lack of a centralised data-gathering method and OHCA registry system.

For patients with newly diagnosed IDH-mutated AML, IDH inhibitors may not be optimal therapeutic agents due to low CR rates. The safety of IDH inhibitors is controllable, but physicians should always pay attention to and manage the differentiation syndrome adverse events caused by IDH inhibitors. The above conclusions need more large samples and high-quality RCTs in the future to verify.",Clinical Epigenetics,2023.0,13,"{'url': 'https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13148-023-01529-2', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10334617, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Hence, this study aimed to evaluate Awareness, Perceptions, and Opinions towards Artificial intelligence (AI) among pharmacy undergraduate students at King Saud University (KSU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted between December 2022 and January 2023 using online questionnaires. The data collection was carried out using convenience sampling methods among senior pharmacy students at the College of Pharmacy, King Saud University. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26 was used to analyze the data (SPSS). Results: A total of one hundred and fifty-seven pharmacy students completed the questionnaires. Of these, most of them (n = 118; 75.2%) were males. About 42%, (n = 65) were in their fourth year of study. Most of the students (n = 116; 73.9%) knew about AI. In addition, 69.4% (n = 109) of the students thought that AI is a tool that helps healthcare professionals (HCP). However, more than half 57.3% (n = 90) of the students were aware that AI would assist healthcare professionals in becoming better with the widespread use of AI. Furthermore, 75.1% of the students agreed that AI reduces errors in medical practice. The mean positive perception score was 29.8 (SD = 9.63; range-0–38). The mean score was significantly associated with age (p = 0.030), year of study (p = 0.040), and nationality (p = 0.013). The gender of the participants was found to have no significant association with the mean positive perception score (p = 0.916). Conclusions: Overall, pharmacy students showed good awareness of AI in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the majority of the students had positive perceptions about the concepts, benefits, and implementation of AI. Moreover, most students indicated that there is a need for more education and training in the field of AI. Consequently, early exposure to content related to AI in the curriculum of pharmacy is an important step to help in the wide use of these technologies in the graduates’ future careers.",Medicina,2023.0,63,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/59/5/828/pdf?version=1682336414', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10221309, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0d2fd5d5439ef974e79209998efb7fedefbd2c25,What is the place of science in Antarctica?,"TheAntarctic Treaty System (ATS) is often paraphrased as providing the means by which Antarctica is protected as a 'continent for peace and science', on the face of it meaning that the primary purpose of humans being present in Antarctica is for the advancement of scientific knowledge. As is well known, some of the earliest expeditions to Antarctica placed scientific discovery and exploration amongst their highest priorities. Scientific research in Antarctica really took off with the International Geophysical Year of 1957/58, illustrating that even then the importance of Antarctica in the global system and for the advancement of science was starting to be appreciated. Even today, the lack of knowledge of parts of the continent and surrounding ocean, and/or within particular disciplines, means that 'discovery science' still has a major role to play. With today's emphasis and focus on the multifaceted field of 'global climate change', it is often easy to forget that little more than 30 years ago the concept was barely mentioned or its importance widely appreciated. So, what were the major drivers of the rapid development of Antarctic science in the midto late-20 Century, before 'climate fever' took over, and to what extent do these still apply? Perhaps more provocatively, does science itself really drive the actions and plans of those nations operating in Antarctica, or is it more accurate to see 'the tail wagging the dog', with scientific priorities and cooperation trailing behind geopolitical manoeuvring and the maximising of national prestige within the ATS? Antarctica has always fascinated humans, whether scientists or not. From both scientific and personal perspectives, it provides some of the planet's extremes and superlatives. With most of the world's ice, lowest temperatures, importance as an upper atmospheric and space observatory and surrounded by the most powerful ocean current, it has long been central to glaciological, geological, tectonic, atmospheric and oceanographic studies. Its extreme environments quickly catalysed research into the evolution and exceptional survival abilities of its resident biota – remarkably diverse in the surrounding ocean and equally remarkably sparse on land, but both sharing very long-term histories in the region. There is still much to learn in all these fields, especially at the boundaries between traditionally distinct disciplines, in what used to be known as 'pure' research, or philosophical recognition of the value of knowledge itself. In today's world, Antarctica and the Southern Ocean play key roles as 'sentinels' for change across the globe, not only relating to climate, but also areas like pollution, erosion of biogeography, space weather and the importance of wilderness values. Their roles as the 'engine' for the global ocean circulation system and a key driver of global climate now take prominence. However, it could be suggested that researchers who cannot connect what they do in someway to 'climate change' are effectively disadvantaged in the increasingly intense world of competition for funding. A widely used tenet of the ATS is that it prevents economic exploitation of Antarctica, but studies in the field of bioprospecting are now accelerating rapidly, while discussions regarding its regulation have stalled over many years in the ATCM and it is now probably too late to shut that stable door (Hughes & Bridge 2010; Joyner 2012). The still largely taboo question of what exploitable mineral resources there are in Antarctica and, if they are there, when and how might they be exploited, has not gone away and it is clear that some Treaty Parties have it actively in their sights (e.g. see https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Russia-Makes-Move-On-Antarcticas-513-BillionBarrels-Of-Oil.html; https://www.upstreamonline.com/politics/cold-war-russian-research-ship-at-centre-ofantarctic-oil-and-gas-prospecting-storm/2-1-1397780; Talalay & Zhang 2022) As with the rest of both our personal lives and national economies, global realities in the early decades of the Twenty-first Century are already leading to important reconsideration of how science is achieved in Antarctica. This could be in terms of how we prioritise the science that is actually done (and who is given the privileged position to do so), how we assess and control our direct environmental impact, how we can develop and apply realistic and honest ways of assessing and controlling our carbon budgets and make our activities as 'green' as possible, or how and what we 'value' in the science generated from Antarctica. There is increasing pressure towards application, where possible, of remote sensing and related approaches to obtaining required data from Antarctica and thereby reducing the direct human footprint. However, seemingly paradoxically, multiple nations have recently, are now, or soon will be engaged in major station reconstruction and expansion programmes, or the construction of entirely new stations or logistic facilities (e.g. airstrips). doi:10.1017/S095410202300007X",Antarctic Science,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/1886C2221E6844BA58F4F34B2702E412/S095410202300007Xa.pdf/div-class-title-what-is-the-place-of-science-in-antarctica-div.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/S095410202300007X?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/S095410202300007X, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5684c6b55fd7df1e248fb90000197ee2a1fd457a,Assessment and analysis of the level of natural science literacy of students,"Introduction. Today, the problem of functional literacy is on the current scientific agenda and is the object of numerous studies, socio-political manipulations and pedagogical influences. Natural-science literacy is most actively studied along with mathematical and reading literacy. The assessment of the quality of education is, in essence, a mechanism for identifying deficits in the education system itself. In this context, the purpose of the article is to analyze the level of development of natural-science literacy of students of secondary vocational and higher education. Materials and methods. To assess students' natural-science literacy, test tasks were developed in accordance with the criteria and parameters used in the PISA study. The study involved students of Bunin Yelets State University, students in the first years of secondary vocational education, bachelor's and specialist's programs. The sample size includes 683 students, which is 83% of the entire general population (determined by the number of first-year students). The study was conducted in September 2022. The design of the study involves the provision and analysis of results on the following parameters (general level of natural-science literacy, natural-science competencies, areas of natural-science knowledge, contexts, motivation for natural-science education) in the context of the entire sample, as well as sample groups classified by level education and training profile. If there is data on any parameter of the all-Russian sample, the results are compared. The processing of the quantitative results of the study was carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis test using the SPSS v.26 software tool. Results. A study of the natural-science literacy of students showed that students have an average level (84.6%), the average score for the sample (541 points) exceeds the national similar indicator (476 points). There were no significant differences between the groups of students in higher and secondary vocational education programs in the study. Statistically significant differences are present in the study of the natural-science literacy of students of various educational profiles. In the sample of students of social-humanitarian profiles, the largest percentage of respondents with a threshold level of science literacy (11.6%), while students of mathematics-technology and natural-science profiles did not demonstrate such results. The largest percentage of students with a high level of natural-science literacy is observed among students of natural-science training profiles (34.5%) and mathematicaltechnological profiles (10.5%). The average score for a sample of students of social-humanitarian profiles is 528 points, mathematics-technology – 561 points, natural-sciences – 595 points. At the same time, within the entire sample, there is an approximately equal percentage of students with threshold (20.2%), low (26.9%), medium (29.7%), and high (23.1%) levels of motivation natural-scientific education. Scientific novelty. For the first time, the natural-science literacy of students was studied on the material of a large sample, taking into account the levels of education (secondary vocational education, higher education) and training profiles (social-humanitarian, natural-science, mathematical-technological). Practical significance. The study of the natural-science literacy of students will significantly increase the significance of national sections of the quality of education, since it gives a complete picture of the features of natural-science education.

7d5a13e370a2661343267747f923f1417727aa83,Big data in tourism marketing: past research and future opportunities,"Purpose
The purpose of this study was to uncover representative emergent areas and to examine the research area of marketing, tourism and big data (BD) to assess how these thematic areas have developed over a 27-year time period from 1996 to 2022. This study analyzed 1,152 studies to identify the principal thematic areas and emergent topics, principal theories used, predominant forms of analysis and the most productive authors in terms of research.

Design/methodology/approach
The articles for this research were all selected from the Web of Science database. A systematic and quantitative literature review was performed. This study used SciMAT software to extract indicators. Specifically, this study analyzed productivity and produced a science map.

Findings
The findings suggest that interest in this area has increased gradually. The outputs also reveal the innovative effort of industry in new technologies for developing models for tourism marketing. Ten research areas were identified: “destination marketing,” “mobility patterns,” “co-creation,” “gastronomy,” “sustainability,” “tourist behavior,” “market segmentation,” “artificial neural networks,” “pricing” and “tourist satisfaction.”

Originality/value
This work is unique in proposing an agenda for future research into tourism marketing research with new technologies such as BD and artificial intelligence techniques. In addition, the results presented here fill the current gap in the research since while there have been literature reviews covering tourism with BD or marketing, these areas have not been studied as a whole.

To identify causal effects, we exploit a quasi-random establishment of Universities of Applied Sciences (UASs), bachelor-granting three-year colleges that teach and conduct applied research. By applying machine-learning methods to job advertisement data, we analyze job content before and after the education expansion. We find that, in regions with the newly established UASs, not only job descriptions of the new UAS graduates but also job descriptions of workers without this degree (i.e., middle-skilled workers with vocational training) contain more high-skill job content. This upskilling in job content is driven by an increase in high-skill R&Drelated tasks and linked to employment and wage gains. The task spillovers likely occur because UAS graduates with applied research skills build a bridge between middle-skilled workers and traditional university graduates, facilitating the integration of the former into R&D-related tasks.

In their role as major global institutional investors and risk managers, insurance companies and pension funds are strategic players in building socio-economic and sustainable development. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of action and research on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in the insurance and pension sectors, we conduct a systematic literature review. We rely on the PRISMA protocol and analyze 1 731 academic publications available in the Web of Science database up to the year 2022 and refer to 23 studies outside of scientific research retrieved from the websites of key international and European organizations. To study the corpus of literature, we introduce a classification framework along the insurance value chain including external stakeholders. The main findings reveal that risk, underwriting and investment management are the most researched areas among the nine categories considered in our framework, while claims management and sales tend to be neglected. Regarding ESG factors, climate change, as part of the environmental factor, has received the most attention in the literature.

17792066950da070a79d3d57172579d69057b9a2,Short-Term Load Forecasting of Electricity Demand for the Residential Sector Based on Modelling Techniques: A Systematic Review,"In this paper, a systematic literature review is presented, through a survey of the main digital databases, regarding modelling methods for Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) for hourly electricity demand for residential electricity and to realize the performance evolution and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in STLF. With these specific objectives, a conceptual framework on the subject was developed, along with a systematic review of the literature based on scientific publications with high impact and a bibliometric study directed towards the scientific production of AI and STLF. The review of research articles over a 10-year period, which took place between 2012 and 2022, used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. This research resulted in more than 300 articles, available in four databases: Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Science Direct. The research was organized around three central themes, which were defined through the following keywords: STLF, Electricity, and Residential, along with their corresponding synonyms. In total, 334 research articles were analyzed, and the year of publication, journal, author, geography by continent and country, and the area of application were identified. Of the 335 documents found in the initial research and after applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, which allowed delimiting the subject addressed in the topics of interest for analysis, 38 (thirty-eight) documents were in English (26 journal articles and 12 conference papers). The results point to a diversity of modelling techniques and associated algorithms. The corresponding performance was measured with different metrics and, therefore, cannot be compared directly. Hence, it is desirable to have a unified dataset, together with a set of benchmarks with well-defined metrics for a clear comparison of all the modelling techniques and the corresponding algorithms.",Energies,2023.0,9,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/10/4098/pdf?version=1684143686', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/en16104098?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/en16104098, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ac3ee2843ccf5f72c24e512e988b5d506ce6a96a,Challenges to the Availability and Affordability of Essential Medicines in African Countries: A Scoping Review,"Introduction The availability and affordability of safe, effective, accessible, and high-quality essential medicines is a critical benchmark for achieving the right to good health, and it is also one of the goals of the global health development agenda. To that end, it is critical to conduct rigorous studies to identify the major challenges confronting developing countries, particularly those in Africa. Objective The purpose of this review was to identify the major challenges that Africans face in obtaining reasonably priced and readily available essential medicines. Methods Generally the Boolean operators “AND” and “OR” were employed. Making progress also involves using duplicate checks, field definitions, and comparisons of articles and criteria. The analysis included all English-language papers published in any African country between 2005 and 2022, depending on the year of publication. The technique searches electronic databases for key phrases related to essential medication availability and affordability, such as PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, Plos Medicine, and Google Scholar. Results A total of 91 articles; by using search engines and handpicking including duplicates, were primarily searched. The electronic database search earned 78 articles while only eleven studies met the criteria for review and were reviewed of which 5 (50%) were from East African countries. Inadequate human resources, financial constraints, high cost of available medications on the market, poor inventory management, manual consumption forecasting, inefficiencies in drug registration, and trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights agreement regulations are all obstacles to the availability of essential medicines in African nations. Conclusion This review revealed that in Africa, the availability and affordability of essential medicines face numerous challenges. The primary challenge, according to the review research, is a lack of adequate financing to pay for an appropriate set of essential medications, which account for a significant portion of household spending.",ClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research,2023.0,42,"{'url': 'https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=90415', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10276598, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fffe299b085b7cf07a232e385cf478e27d60f6f2,A Critical Computing Curriculum Design Case: Exploring Tribal Sovereignty for Middle School Students,"We report on our efforts to design an integrated computing curriculum for middle school students in Montana that is in line with the Kapor Center’s focus on culturally sustaining-revitalizing pedagogies. Montana provides a unique context for doing this work because a state constitutional mandate requires all K-12 students to learn about tribal histories and cultures through Indian Education For All (IEFA). IEFA centers around seven essential understandings about Indigenous peoples in Montana that are integrated across content areas. In addition, implementation of Montana’s CS standards began in the 2021–2022 school year. In the curricular design, we sought to bring together IEFA and CS standards with grades 6–8 social studies standards though a focus on food sovereignty, the right of a group of people “to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems” (https://nyeleni.org/IMG/pdf/DeclNyeleni-en.pdf). We are guided by the following research questions: (1) What are the design strategies and tactics necessary to make IEFA and CS content accessible to middle school students and their teachers? And (2) What are some of the challenges and limitations of designing culturally responsive-sustaining computer science curricula? To address these research questions, we provide an overview of the food sovereignty units we developed. We then share the strategies and tactics we employed to design the units. Finally, we critically reflect on the process of designing such a unit and our own limitations as designers.",Journal of Computer Science Integration,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/jnl-up-j-jcsi-files/journals/1/articles/45/658c0b0119cb6.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.26716/jcsi.2023.12.27.45?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.26716/jcsi.2023.12.27.45, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9788da82cb14a5c02f85b22612ac6a221d7bb9f1,Prevalence and natural history of depression after stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies,"Background Depression is the most frequent psychiatric condition after stroke and is associated with negative health outcomes. We aim to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and natural history of depression after stroke. Methods and findings Studies published up to 4 November 2022 on Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched. We included studies of adults with stroke, where depression was assessed at a prespecified time point. Studies excluding people with aphasia and history of depression are excluded. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme(CASP) cohort study tool was used to assess risk of bias. A total of 77 studies were included in the pooled estimates of the prevalence of poststroke depression (PSD). The overall prevalence of depression was 27% (95% CI 25 to 30). Prevalence of depression was 24% (95% CI 21 to 28) by clinical interview and 29% (95% CI 25 to 32) by rating scales. Twenty-four studies with more than one assessment time point reported the natural history of PSD. Among people who were depressed within 3 months of stroke, 53% (95% CI 47 to 59) experienced persistent depression, while 44% (95% CI 38 to 50) recovered. The incidence of later depression (3 to 12 months after stroke) was 9% (95% CI 7 to 12). The cumulative incidence during 1 year after stroke was 38% (95% CI 33 to 43), and the majority (71% (95% CI 65 to 76)) of depression had onset within 3 months after stroke. The main limitation of the present study is that excluding people in source studies with severe impairments may produce imprecise estimates of the prevalence of PSD. Conclusions In this study, we observed that stroke survivors with early-onset depression (within 3 months after stroke) are at high risks for remaining depressed and make up two-thirds of the incident cases during 1 year after stroke. This highlights the need for ongoing clinical monitoring of patients depressed shortly after stroke.

63c1eff1db814b80ba886d73c2d42a52db4d32d9,Changing Trend in the Antibiotic Resistance Pattern of Klebsiella Pneumonia Isolated From Endotracheal Aspirate Samples of ICU Patients of a Tertiary Care Hospital in North India,"Introduction Klebsiella pneumonia is one of the most prevalent bacteria that cause nosocomial infections, particularly in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (MDRKP) has become an urgent risk to public health as its prevalence has sharply surged around the globe in recent decades. Therefore, this research was conducted to evaluate shifts over a four-year period in drug susceptibility patterns among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients. Materials and methods This is a retrospective observational study conducted in a tertiary care multi-specialty hospital and teaching institute in North India and was approved by the institutional ethics committee. The research comprised Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from endotracheal aspirates (ETA) of patients on mechanical ventilation admitted to the general intensive care unit (ICU) of our tertiary care facility. The data from January to June 2018 and January to June 2022 were collected. According to the antimicrobial resistance profile of the strains, they were categorized as susceptible, resistant to one or two antimicrobial categories, multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), or pan-drug-resistant (PDR). The criteria for MDR, XDR, and PDR were proposed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, Version 24.0, Armonk, NY, IBM Corp., was used for data input and analysis. Results A total of 82 cases of Klebsiella pneumonia were included in the study. Of these 82 isolates, 40 were isolated over a period of six months from January to June 2018, and the remaining 42 were isolated from January to June 2022. Among the 2018 group, five strains (12.5%) were classified as susceptible, three (7.5%) as resistant, seven (17.5%) as MDR, and 25 (62.5%) as XDR. The highest percentages of antimicrobial resistance in the 2018 group were observed with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (90%), ciprofloxacin (100%), piperacillin/tazobactam (92.5%), and cefoperazone/sulbactam (95%). In comparison, the 2022 group showed no strain as susceptible; nine strains (21.4%) were classified as resistant; three strains (7%) as MDR; and 30 strains (93%) were classified as XDR. There was a significant increase in resistance to amoxicillin, from 10% in 2018 to nil in 2022. Overall, the rate of resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia) increased from 7.5% (3/40) in 2018 to 21.4% (9/42) in 2022, while XDR Klebsiella pneumonia among the mechanically ventilated ICU patients significantly increased from 62.5% (25/40) in 2018 to 71% (30/42) in 2022. Conclusion K. pneumoniae antibiotic resistance is a real threat in Asia and requires close monitoring to be controlled. More careful attempts should be made to create a new generation of antimicrobials since the prevalence of resistance to existing medications is rising. Antibiotic resistance should be monitored and reported by healthcare institutions regularly.",Cureus,2023.0,30,"{'url': 'https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/136634/20230318-21712-13d5570.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10106535, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

With the theme “Nuclear Science and Technology for Sustainable Development Goals”, iNuSTEC2023 is the thirteenth in a series of conferences hosted by the Malaysian Nuclear Society (MNS) since 2010 through collaboration with research institutes and local universities. Don’t we feel like time has passed by so quickly? And with it, came along significant and some were unthinkable changes to our lives. According to Our World in Data statistics, in 2022, each of us consumed on average 3.5 times more energy compared to 40 years ago. In the year 2050, Malaysia is expected to consume almost twice the amount of electricity in 2022 (320 TWh vs. 180 TWh). This means that on a daily basis in 2050, Malaysia is expected to consume close to 0.9 TWh of electricity per day. About 50 million electric vehicles are expected to be on the road in 2050. Every day, about 0.6 TWh of electricity is needed to charge these cars. That is an additional two-thirds of the expected daily electricity consumption per person in 2050. Malaysia has identified the pathways for Responsible Transition 2050 in the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) to tackle the energy trilemma of affordability, security, and sustainability. These pathways include having 0% coal share and 70% renewable energy share of installed capacity in 2050. 70% of renewable energy share is about 57 GW of solar PV, which will take a total land size that is slightly smaller than Melaka state. The same amount of power can be generated by nuclear power on a total land size that is 10 times smaller. That is not even considering the intermittency of power generation with solar PV. At UNITEN, we believe that research and knowledge in nuclear power can play a huge role in supporting the Low Carbon Nation Aspiration and the Responsible Transition, especially in providing affordable, clean and safe energy supply to the Rakyat. Institute of Nuclear Energy (INE) at UNITEN was established in May this year to further empower and accelerate the existing research and educational efforts done at UNITEN since 2010. At the university level, UNITEN has established the National Energy Centre (NEC) to support the national energy transition efforts. NEC will serve as a hub for research institutes, industrial and international linkages, and government agencies to form collaborations with experts from local and foreign universities, energy agencies, and stakeholders. UNITEN envisions that NEC will play a significant role in providing technological solutions for Malaysia’s energy transition which will be beneficial to Malaysia, as well as the surrounding region. NEC will also play the role of capacity building for the country’s future workforce that will lead Malaysia towards net-zero in 2050. I extend my warmest invitation to every participant attending this conference, to be a part of this concerted nationwide effort in championing sustainability through involvement with the NEC. I would like to remind participants, that you are among the very small percentage of Malaysia’s population, who are experts in the nuclear field. Thank you so much for your contributions to keeping the knowledge related to nuclear science and engineering alive, despite how hard or negative it can get in the industry. Congratulations to the organizing committee for hosting this iNuSTEC2023 together with the Nuclear Youth Competition (NYC2023). My deepest appreciation goes to our keynote speakers, technical co-sponsors, and all supporters for their contribution to ensuring the success of this conference.

To determine the global prevalence of nursing burnout syndrome and time trends for the last 10 years.


BACKGROUND
The prevalence of burnout syndrome varied greatly in different regions in the last 10 years, so the average prevalence and time trends of nursing burnout syndrome for the last 10 years were not completely clear.


DESIGN
A meta-analysis conducted in the PRISMA guidelines.


METHODS
CINAHL, Web of Science, and PubMed were searched for trials on the prevalence of nursing burnout syndrome from 2012 to 2022 systematically. Hoy's quality assessment tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias. The global prevalence of nursing burnout syndrome was estimated, and subgroup analysis was used to explore what caused heterogeneity. Time trends for the last 10 years were evaluated by meta-regression using Stata 11.0.


RESULTS
Ninety-four studies reporting the prevalence of nursing burnout were included. The global prevalence of nursing burnout was 30.0% [95% CI: 26.0%-34.0%]. Subgroup analysis indicated that the specialty (p < .001) and the region (p < .001) and the year (p < .001) were sources of the high heterogeneity. Meta-regression indicated that it tended to increase gradually for the last 10 years (t = 3.71, p = .006). The trends increased in Europe (t = 4.23, p = .006), Africa (t = 3.75, p = .006) and obstetrics (t = 3.66, p = .015). However, no statistical significance was found in ICU (t = -.14, p = .893), oncology (t = -0.44, p = .691) and emergency department (t = -0.30, p = .783).


CONCLUSIONS
A significant number of nurses were found to have moderate-high levels of burnout syndrome for the last 10 years. The meta-analysis also indicated an increased trend over time. Therefore, more attention to the prevalence of nursing burnout syndrome is urgently required.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
High prevalence of nursing burnout may attract more attention from the public. This analysis may serve as an impetus for relevant policy to change nurses' working conditions and reduce the occurrence of burnout.",Journal of Clinical Nursing,2023.0,52,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/jocn.16708?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16708, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9f143ee49584d2f25d1d711611af3d94ec8adf73,Outcome of intrauterine insemination in couples with unexplained or male factor infertility at National Referral Hospital of Bhutan,"

Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital (JDWNRH) is the only facility offering intrauterine insemination (IUI) services in the country. In this study, we aim to study the success rate of IUI for the year 2022.



This retrospective study utilized secondary data extracted from the medical records of a cohort of 57 patients who underwent IUI procedures at the infertility clinic between January and December 2022. Ethical clearance and site approval were obtained from the Institutional Review Board at Khesar Gyalpo University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan and JDWNRH, respectively. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26.0 by IBM Corp in Armonk, NY, was used to calculate frequencies, percentages and create statistical diagrams.



In the year 2022, the overall success rate of IUI was 5.3%. A majority of infertile men, representing 78.9%, fell within the age range of 30–39 years, and oligozoospermia emerged as the most common semen abnormality, affecting 45.6% of the infertile men in this study.



Our study revealed that the IUI success rate in the country was 5.3%. This success rate of IUI in the country was found to be low compared to the success rate in neighboring countries. This is important information for patients to make informed decisions, aids fertility specialists in devising treatment plans, directs the allocation of resources, drives research and development initiatives, and informs policy and strategic adjustments at the national level.

f2c1be556418a024ec33cdda791261cfe8d0c047,BJC Sparks: A New Functional-First Middle School CS Curriculum,"We present our experience with the design and implementation of BJC Sparks, a new introductory computer science curriculum for middle school piloted by ten teachers in the 2021-2022 academic year. Our curriculum is functional-first, using abstraction, functional decomposition, immutable data, and powerful higher-order functions such as map, keep, and combine. Based on a decade of experience teaching thousands of first-time programmers, we believe starting with functions teaches students the habit of solving problems functionally when possible, helping to avoid bugs in later programming experiences. BJC Sparks uses the Snap! blocks-based programming environment, which brings the expressive power of a general-purpose programming language without requiring mastery of the syntax of a text-based language. We take advantage of new Snap! features to develop microworlds: customized projects that simplify the blocks palette to further lower cognitive load. We designed projects that use Snap!'s multimedia features to explore data science, encryption, and computational media. We end with physical computing using the BBC micro:bit that students program using MicroBlocks. In terms of findings, we confirmed that it indeed was possible to capture the interest of middle school students with functional programming activities, especially through the use of microworlds. We were surprised at the strong student and teacher interest in our micro:bit lessons, which many wanted as a stand-alone unit. Finally, it became quite clear that multimedia and data science projects offer promising avenues for teaching functional programming through fun, engaging, and personally relevant activities.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3545945.3569842', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3545945.3569842?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3545945.3569842, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The study was conducted in some public secondary schools in the central districts of Diyarbakir province in the fall semester of the 2022-2023 academic year. There were 25 teachers in the participant group, of whom 7 were female and 18 were male. The data in this study, in which a phenomenological design was used, were collected using the semi-structured interview technique. The data analysis, which employed two different methods, namely descriptive and content analysis, was completed with a computer-aided qualitative analysis program. As far as the results obtained in the study are concerned, it can be said that the teachers predominantly had negative views about their job satisfaction. The outstanding factors for teachers’ job satisfaction were intrinsic motivation, physical conditions of the school, communication with the school administration, socio-economic level, and respect for the profession. In this sense, it is believed that strong communication established between the school administration and teachers, the improvement of the physical conditions in schools, and fair wage policies will contribute positively to the job satisfaction of teachers.",International Journal of Research in Education and Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ijres.net/index.php/ijres/article/download/3245/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.46328/ijres.3245?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.46328/ijres.3245, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

12fbe7dac5ca720df6182d5c83fc2c25dc273fb7,Complement inhibitors for age-related macular degeneration.,"BACKGROUND
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye disease and leading cause of sight loss worldwide. Despite its high prevalence and increasing incidence as populations age, AMD remains incurable and there are no treatments for most patients. Mounting genetic and molecular evidence implicates complement system overactivity as a key driver of AMD development and progression. The last decade has seen the development of several novel therapeutics targeting complement in the eye for the treatment of AMD. This review update encompasses the results of the first randomised controlled trials in this field.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effects and safety of complement inhibitors in the prevention or treatment of AMD.


SEARCH METHODS
We searched CENTRAL on the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Web of Science, ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP to 29 June 2022 with no language restrictions. We also contacted companies running clinical trials for unpublished data.


SELECTION CRITERIA
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with parallel groups and comparator arms that studied complement inhibition for advanced AMD prevention/treatment.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two authors independently assessed search results and resolved discrepancies through discussion. Outcome measures evaluated at one year included change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), untransformed and square root-transformed geographic atrophy (GA) lesion size progression, development of macular neovascularisation (MNV) or exudative AMD, development of endophthalmitis, loss of ≥ 15 letters of BCVA, change in low luminance visual acuity, and change in quality of life. We assessed risk of bias and evidence certainty using Cochrane risk of bias and GRADE tools.


MAIN RESULTS
Ten RCTs with 4052 participants and eyes with GA were included. Nine evaluated intravitreal (IVT) administrations against sham, and one investigated an intravenous agent against placebo. Seven studies excluded patients with prior MNV in the non-study eye, whereas the three pegcetacoplan studies did not. The risk of bias in the included studies was low overall. We also synthesised results of two intravitreal agents (lampalizumab, pegcetacoplan) at monthly and every-other-month (EOM) dosing intervals. Efficacy and safety of IVT lampalizumab versus sham for GA For 1932 participants in three studies, lampalizumab did not meaningfully change BCVA given monthly (+1.03 letters, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.19 to 2.25) or EOM (+0.22 letters, 95% CI -1.00 to 1.44) (high-certainty evidence). For 1920 participants, lampalizumab did not meaningfully change GA lesion growth given monthly (+0.07 mm², 95% CI -0.09 to 0.23; moderate-certainty due to imprecision) or EOM (+0.07 mm², 95% CI -0.05 to 0.19; high-certainty). For 2000 participants, lampalizumab may have also increased MNV risk given monthly (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.73 to 4.30) and EOM (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.28), based on low-certainty evidence. The incidence of endophthalmitis in patients treated with monthly and EOM lampalizumab was 4 per 1000 (0 to 87) and 3 per 1000 (0 to 62), respectively, based on moderate-certainty evidence. Efficacy and safety of IVT pegcetacoplan versus sham for GA For 242 participants in one study, pegcetacoplan probably did not meaningfully change BCVA given monthly (+1.05 letters, 95% CI -2.71 to 4.81) or EOM (-1.42 letters, 95% CI -5.25 to 2.41), as supported by moderate-certainty evidence. In contrast, for 1208 participants across three studies, pegcetacoplan meaningfully reduced GA lesion growth when given monthly (-0.38 mm², 95% CI -0.57 to -0.19) and EOM (-0.29 mm², 95% CI -0.44 to -0.13), with high certainty. These reductions correspond to 19.2% and 14.8% versus sham, respectively. A post hoc analysis showed possibly greater benefits in 446 participants with extrafoveal GA given monthly (-0.67 mm², 95% CI -0.98 to -0.36) and EOM (-0.60 mm², 95% CI -0.91 to -0.30), representing 26.1% and 23.3% reductions, respectively. However, we did not have data on subfoveal GA growth to undertake a formal subgroup analysis. In 1502 participants, there is low-certainty evidence that pegcetacoplan may have increased MNV risk when given monthly (RR 4.47, 95% CI 0.41 to 48.98) or EOM (RR 2.29, 95% CI 0.46 to 11.35). The incidence of endophthalmitis in patients treated with monthly and EOM pegcetacoplan was 6 per 1000 (1 to 53) and 8 per 1000 (1 to 70) respectively, based on moderate-certainty evidence. Efficacy and safety of IVT avacincaptad pegol versus sham for GA In a study of 260 participants with extrafoveal or juxtafoveal GA, monthly avacincaptad pegol probably did not result in a clinically meaningful change in BCVA at 2 mg (+1.39 letters, 95% CI -5.89 to 8.67) or 4 mg (-0.28 letters, 95% CI -8.74 to 8.18), based on moderate-certainty evidence. Despite this, the drug was still found to have probably reduced GA lesion growth, with estimates of 30.5% reduction at 2 mg (-0.70 mm², 95% CI -1.99 to 0.59) and 25.6% reduction at 4 mg (-0.71 mm², 95% CI -1.92 to 0.51), based on moderate-certainty evidence. Avacincaptad pegol may have also increased the risk of developing MNV (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 10.55), although this evidence is of low certainty. There were no cases of endophthalmitis reported in this study.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Despite confirmation of the negative findings of intravitreal lampalizumab across all endpoints, local complement inhibition with intravitreal pegcetacoplan meaningfully reduces GA lesion growth relative to sham at one year. Inhibition of complement C5 with intravitreal avacincaptad pegol is also an emerging therapy with probable benefits on anatomical endpoints in the extrafoveal or juxtafoveal GA population. However, there is currently no evidence that complement inhibition with any agent improves functional endpoints in advanced AMD; further results from the phase 3 studies of pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad pegol are eagerly awaited. Progression to MNV or exudative AMD is a possible emergent adverse event of complement inhibition, requiring careful consideration should these agents be used clinically. Intravitreal administration of complement inhibitors is probably associated with a small risk of endophthalmitis, which may be higher than that of other intravitreal therapies. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of adverse effects and may change these. The optimal dosing regimens, treatment duration, and cost-effectiveness of such therapies are yet to be established.",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2023.0,27,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/14651858.CD009300.pub3?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009300.pub3, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aimed to evaluate the DAE research trends over the span of 60 years using bibliometric analysis. Methods Sampling was performed in the Scopus database using a search string (“Dental Age Estimation” OR “Age Determination by Teeth”) to detect DAE-related studies. The search was performed from inception to the year 2022. A data-cleaning intervention using a fuzzy-matching technique was done to unify the author and affiliation name variations. Results The initial search returned 1638 articles, years of publication ranging from 1964 to 2022, with an approximate growth rate of 5.9% a year. Source analysis showed that most of the top article sources were Forensic Science International ( n  = 200). Cameriere R presents the overall highest score (77 articles, Local h-index 30). Authors from Shanghai Jiao Tong University produced the highest number of publications ( n  = 111). The most locally cited study was “ A New System of Dental Age Assessment ” by Demirjian et al. (Hum Biol 45:211-227, 1973) ( n  = 1507). The trending topics analysis shows that earlier DAE studies were focused on dental regressive changes and later changed focus to utilizing technological advancements. Institutions and Author's collaborations were also found to be internationally diverse with 20.82% of the articles being a product of international co-authorships. Conclusions DAE research has grown rapidly helped by multiple advancements in various technological ends.

We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of immunotherapy or targeted therapy as the first-line strategy for unresectable HCC. Methods The included clinical trials were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, and Web of Science databases, in which immunotherapy or targeted therapy was regarded as the first-line treatment for unresectable HCC, published in English between January 1, 2010, and September 20, 2022. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from the Chinese payer’s perspective. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), the ranks of different treatments using P-score, and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated by NMA. Total costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-benefit ratio (ICER) were estimated from 15-year Markov models developed by CEA. Results We identified 2,825 records, including 11,796 patients, from 15 RCTs. The NMA revealed that sintilimab plus a bevacizumab biosimilar (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.75; P = 0.96) and camrelizumab plus rivoceranib (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.66; P = 0.94) could lead to great improvements in OS and PFS compared with sorafenib-related survival. The CEA indicated that tislelizumab increased by 0.220 QALYs (0.312 LYs) and decreased by $1,938 compared with sorafenib, which yielded ICERs of -$8,809/QALY (-$2,612/LY). Sensitivity analysis showed that the model was stable. Conclusion Sintilimab plus a bevacizumab biosimilar and camrelizumab plus rivoceranib significantly prolonged OS and PFS, respectively.

e33f3fe865883b98cc792063ebe2db25b48fd2e4,Systematic review to estimate the prevalence of inflammatory rheumatic diseases in Germany,"Objective This study aimed to update the prevalence estimates of inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) in Germany. Methods A systematic literature search in PubMed and Web of Science (last search 08 November 2022) identified original articles (regional and nationwide surveys and claims data analyses for arthritides, connective tissue diseases, and vasculitides) on prevalences for the period 2014–2022. Data sources, collection period, case definition, and risk of bias are reported. Prevalences were estimated from available national data, with consideration of international data. Results Screening by two authors yielded 263 hits, of which 18 claims data analyses and 2 surveys met the inclusion criteria. Prevalences ranged from 0.42 to 1.85% (rheumatoid arthritis), 0.32–0.5% (ankylosing spondylitis), 0.11–0.32% (psoriatic arthritis), 0.037–0.14% (systemic lupus erythematosus), 0.07–0.77% (Sjögren’s disease/sicca syndrome), 0.14–0.15% (polymyalgia rheumatica, ≥ 40 years), 0.04–0.05% (giant cell arteritis, ≥ 50 years), and 0.015–0.026% (ANCA-associated vasculitis). The risk of bias was moderate in 13 and high in 7 studies. Based on the results, we estimate the prevalence of IRD in Germany to be 2.2–3.0%, which corresponds to approximately 1.5–2.1 million affected individuals. The prevalence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis was reported to be around 0.10% (0.07–0.10%) of 0–18-year-olds, corresponding to about 14,000 children and adolescents in Germany. Conclusion This systematic review shows an increase in the prevalence of IRD in Germany, which is almost exclusively based on claims data analyses. In the absence of multistage population studies, the available data are, overall, uncertain sources for prevalence estimates, with a moderate to high risk of bias. Zielsetzung Ziel der Arbeit war eine aktualisierte Schätzung der Prävalenz entzündlich-rheumatischer Erkrankungen (ERE) in Deutschland. Methodik Mit einer systematischen Literaturrecherche in den Datenbanken PubMed und Web of Science (letzte Suche am 08.11.2022) wurden Originalartikel (regionale und bundesweite Surveys und Routinedatenanalysen für Arthritiden, Kollagenosen und Vaskulitiden) zur ERE-Prävalenz für den Zeitraum 2014–2022 identifiziert. Datenquellen, Erhebungszeitraum, Diagnosedefinition und das Risiko einer Verzerrung werden mitgeteilt. Die Prävalenzen wurden anhand der verfügbaren nationalen Daten unter Berücksichtigung internationaler Angaben geschätzt. Ergebnisse Die Suche durch 2 Autorinnen ergab 263 Treffer, von denen 18 Routinedatenanalysen und 2 Surveys die Einschlusskriterien erfüllten. Die Prävalenzangaben lagen bei 0,42–1,85 % (rheumatoide Arthritis), 0,32–0,5 % (ankylosierende Spondylitis), 0,11–0,32 % (Psoriasisarthritis), 0,037–0,14 % (systemischer Lupus erythematodes), 0,07–0,77 % (Sjögren‑/Sicca-Syndrom), 0,14–0,15 % (Polymyalgia rheumatica, ab 40 Jahre), 0,04–0,05 % (Riesenzellarteriitis, ab 50 Jahre) und 0,015–0,026 % (mit antineutrophilen zytoplasmatischen Antikörpern [ANCA-]assoziierte Vaskulitis). Das Bias-Risiko war in 13 Studien moderat, in 7 Studien hoch. Anhand dieser Ergebnisse schätzen die Autorinnen die Prävalenz von ERE in Deutschland auf 2,2–3,0 %. Dies entspricht in etwa 1,5–2,1 Mio.

a73b8407ca74ea68203f5283349cbea429d7c773,Prevalence of post-traumatic osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament injury remains high despite advances in surgical techniques.,"Aims
The aim of this study was to report the pooled prevalence of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) and examine whether the risk of developing PTOA after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has decreased in recent decades.


Methods
The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched from 1 January 1980 to 11 May 2022. Patient series, observational studies, and clinical trials having reported the prevalence of radiologically confirmed PTOA after ACL injury, with at least a ten-year follow-up, were included. All studies were analyzed simultaneously, and separate analyses of the operative and nonoperative knees were performed. The prevalence of PTOA was calculated separately for each study, and pooled prevalence was reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using either a fixed or random effects model. To examine the effect of the year of injury on the prevalence, a logit transformed meta-regression analysis was used with a maximum-likelihood estimator. Results from meta-regression analyses were reported with the unstandardized coefficient (β).


Results
The pooled prevalence of PTOA was 37.9% (95% CI 32.1 to 44) for operatively treated ACL injuries with a median follow-up of 14.6 years (interquartile range (IQR) 10.6 to 16.7). For nonoperatively treated ACL injuries, the prevalence was 40.5% (95% CI 28.9 to 53.3), with a median of follow-up of 15 years (IQR 11.7 to 20.0). The association between the year of operation and the prevalence of PTOA was weak and imprecise and not related to the choice of treatment (operative β -0.038 (95% CI -0.076 to 0.000) and nonoperative β -0.011 (95% CI -0.101 to 0.079)).


Conclusion
The initial injury, irrespective of management, has, by the balance of probability, resulted in PTOA within 20 years. In addition, the prevalence of PTOA has only slightly decreased during past decades. Therefore, further research is warranted to develop strategies to prevent the development of PTOA after ACL injuries.",The Bone & Joint Journal,2023.0,8,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1302/0301-620X.105B11.BJJ-2023-0058.R1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1302/0301-620X.105B11.BJJ-2023-0058.R1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The research was performed at three Slovak grammar schools in the 1st year during the 2nd term of the 2021/2022 school year. This research employed the experimental approach with a quasi-experimental design that involved experimental and control groups. The research sample consisted of 218 students, and it was divided into two groups: the experimental group comprised 114 students (who studied using the 5E model) and the control group comprised 104 students (who studied conventionally). The intervention took place during eight lessons (four two-hour laboratory exercises). A set of inquiry-based activities for the “chemical reactions and equations” thematic unit verified via pilot research was implemented using the 5E model in the experimental group. The research used the following tools: the chemistry concepts test based on the revised Bloom’s taxonomy and a questionnaire to identify the attitudes of students towards chemistry as a subject. The chemistry concepts test results indicated that teaching with the 5E model was more effective than teaching without the 5E model in terms of developing cognitive processes. It affected all the observed cognitive processes (memorization, understanding, application, analysis, and evaluation). After teaching with 5E model, students’ attitudes in experimental group towards learning chemistry as a subject changed significantly. Finally, research presents some recommendations, including conducting more studies on 5E model-based strategy, cognitive processes, and attitudes towards science.","Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education",2023.0,8,"{'url': 'https://www.ejmste.com/download/the-effect-of-the-5e-instructional-model-on-students-cognitive-processes-and-their-attitudes-towards-13469.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.29333/ejmste/13469?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.29333/ejmste/13469, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

77996090004b0f83ad078d98464feb96ea9357e3,Research trends on the relationship between gut microbiota and colorectal cancer: A bibliometric analysis,"Background Colorectal cancer (CRC)is the third most common cancer in the world and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and over the past two decades, many of these researchers have provided a substantial amount of important information on the role of gut microbes in the development and progression of CRC. A causal relationship between the presence of specific microorganisms and CRC development has also been validated. Although a large number of papers related to this area have been published, no bibliometric study has been conducted to review the current state of research in this area and to highlight the research trends and hotspots in this area. This study aims to analyze the current status and future research trends of gut microbiota and CRC through bibliometric analysis. Methods Publications from 2001 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database and screened according to inclusion criteria. VOSviewer and CiteSpace software were used to visualize the research trends in this field, including the analysis of title, country, institution, author, number of publications, year of publication, number of citations, journal, and H-index. Results A total of 863 studies were eventually identified, and the articles retrieved were cited an average of 44.85 times each. The number of publications on this topic has been increased steadily since 2011. China and the USA have made the largest contribution in the field. FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY is the top productive journal with 26 papers, and Gut journal has the highest average citation (167.23). Shanghai Jiao Tong University is the most contributive institution. Professor Yu J, Sung, Joseph J. Y and Fang JY are the most productive authors in this field. Keyword co-occurrence analysis showed that the terms of “Gut Microbiota”, “Colorectal Cancer”, “Inflammation”, “Probiotic” and “Fusobacterium Nucleatum” were the most frequent, which revealed the research hotpots and trends in this field. Conclusions There has been a growing number of publications over the past two decades according to the global trends. China and the USA still maintained the leading position in this field. However, collaboration between institutions needs to be strengthened. It’s commended to pay attention to the latest hotspots, such as “F. nucleatum” and “probiotics”.

We performed a scoping review of methods that retrospectively improve race/ethnicity classification in secondary datasets. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science Core Collection in July 2022. A total of 2,441 abstracts were dually screened, 453 full-text articles were reviewed, and 120 articles were included. Study characteristics were extracted and described in a narrative analysis, including: method type used for race/ethnicity classification; races/ethnicities targeted for classification; publication year; method inputs; reference population (if applicable); target population; and whether the article included a validation process. Six main method types for improving race/ethnicity were identified: Expert Review (n=9; 8%), Name Lists (n = 27; 23%), Name Algorithms (n=55; 46%), Machine Learning (n=14; 12%), Data Linkage (n=9; 8%), and Other (n=6; 5%). The main racial/ethnic groups targeted for classification were Asian (n = 56; 47%) and White (n = 51; 43%). Eighty-six articles (72%) included some form of validation evaluation. We discuss the strengths and limitations of different method types and potential harms of identified methods. We recommend the need for innovative methods to better identify racial/ethnic subgroups and further validation studies. Accurately collecting and reporting disaggregated data by race/ethnicity is critical to address the systematic missingness of relevant demographic data that can erroneously guide policymaking and hinder the effectiveness of healthcare practices and intervention.",Epidemiologic Reviews,2023.0,5,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/epirev/mxad002?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/epirev/mxad002, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Bibliometric studies are commonly employed to examine the current research climate, potential developments, and development trends in certain domains. In this work, the major contributors to camel research throughout the past century are discussed, along with the funding sources, academic institutions, scientific disciplines, and countries that contributed to “Camel Research”. Methods The Web of Science (WOS) database was used to retrieve the publications based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) instructions. Results There are 7,593 articles dedicated to camel research on the Web of Science (as of August 1st, 2022). Three stages were involved in the publication of a study on camels. At the beginning, from 1877 to 1965, there were fewer than ten new publications per year. The second stage comprised 100 publications per year (1968–2005). Since 2010, nearly 200 new papers have been published each year. King Saud and King Faisal universities contributed > (0.08) of the total publications. While more than 1,000 funding agents were retrieved, the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) showed the greatest rate of funded projects (0.17). Camel research was included in 238 scientific disciplines. The top disciplines were Veterinary Sciences (0.39), Agriculture Dairy Animal Science (0.144), and Food Science Technology (0.087).

Sa FNRI: Exploring the Potential of Workplace Urban Garden for Food Self-provisioning,"This study explores the potential of workplace edible gardens in promoting food self-provisioning (FSP) and in helping enhance food security in the Philippines. In 2017, an urban edible garden or Oh My Gulay! Sa FNRI (OMG) was set up in front of the Department of Science and Technology–Food and Nutrition Research Institute (DOST-FNRI) Building to showcase the concept of an urban garden in a workplace. This is an example of FSP in the workplace. The study used primary and secondary data. Primary data included OMG vegetable volume harvested from 2018–2022 and the garden’s land area. Secondary data were the national vegetable volume harvested and area from the Philippine Statistics Office (PSA). The characteristics and practices of OMG were also used to measure the OMG’s productivity (yield and number of servings produced). The productivity of OMG was compared to the national productivity of 34 vegetable crops in the Philippines (PSA 2018–2022), except for 2020. The results demonstrate that an FSP in the workplace setting like OMG can provide adequate quantity to supply the vegetable recommendation for five adult individuals, following the WHO/FAO recommendation of consuming 400 g/d or 146 kg per adult individual per year of fruits and vegetables or a family composed of two adults and two children following the WHO/FAP recommendation of 1,300 g/d of fruits and vegetables. In addition, for every 71 m2 of land cultivated in a manner similar to the OMG, it can sustain an adult's vegetable needs for an entire year. Furthermore, with a larger area of 397 m2, the OMG garden can adequately supply a family with sufficient vegetables for a year, thereby showcasing its capacity to contribute to long-term food security at the household level.

e9d64ebc9ee2b4d3ce866733c8fe0edd19969145,Exploratory Data Analytics of Ota Transmission Sub-Station Electricity Load Patterns: Insights for Forecasting and Policy Direction,"Electricity supply and planning play a vital role in supporting economic development and improving the quality of life for communities. Effective decision-making in this domain requires a thorough understanding of electricity load patterns and consumption trends. Exploratory Data Analysis offers valuable opportunities to gain insights from electricity load data, as a use case of data science. In this study, 33KV feeders' peak load electricity measurements are acquired from Ota transmission stations, spanning four years (2019 to 2022). This data provides a rich source of information on seasonal variations in electricity consumption toward understanding demand patterns for optimizing resource allocation and infrastructure planning. Data analytics was therefore implemented on the historical peak load measurements to gather actionable insights for industry practitioners. Experimental results returns mean load value as a range from 4.24 to 20.16, indicating variations in electricity demand across the areas. The median values, ranging from 4.00 to 18.00, shows load measurements tend to center around a relatively stable level. Standard deviations value, between 1.27 and 2.61, illustrate the degree of variability in load measurements. The maximum load value discovered as 23.5 signifies the highest demand observed during the four-year study period, while the minimum load value of 1.0 signifies periods of low electricity consumption. The results also highlight variations in total load, emphasizing the importance of location-specific policies and infrastructure planning. For instance, AMJE exhibits the highest total load of 967.5, followed by Sango with 850.5 and IDI-IROKO with 689.5. Positive correlations are observed between SANGO and SUMO, indicating a tendency for these locations to experience similar load patterns. Whereas, negative correlations observed between IDI-IROKO and SUMO indicate contrasting load patterns between these locations. These correlations provide valuable insights for understanding dependencies and potential interactions between different areas within the Ota metropolis. The results are crucial for understanding peak load management, resource planning, and infrastructure optimization, which is a useful resource for industry stakeholders.","2024 International Conference on Science, Engineering and Business for Driving Sustainable Development Goals (SEB4SDG)",2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/SEB4SDG60871.2024.10629674?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/SEB4SDG60871.2024.10629674, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In the first paper, which was published by us in the year 2015, we had defined and set forth the core objectives of what we called twenty-first century historiography. In the second paper published by us in 2016, we had postulated the core principles of twentyfirst century historiography. In the third paper published by us in 2018, we had had introduced the concept of Anthropological Historiography wherein we had sought to integrate history with pre-history and proto-history much better. In the fourth paper on qualified historiography published by us in 2022, we had tried to explain how historiography could be dealt with in the case of the unreliability and uncertainty of narratives. In the present paper, we put forward a case for investigative historiography which can be developed as a niche area well within mainstream twenty-first century historiography. The objective of this niche subfield would be to lay bare the tools, techniques and the scientific methods that could be employed and put to use in carrying out historical investigations. Some of these tools and techniques may already exist and may already be in use, but we put forward new approaches keeping in mind the overall philosophy of twenty-first century historiography.

6dea9794874d32dc9cb1971939bfe6dd1a41ebe5,Building Biodiversity Digital Twins,"A digital twin is a replica of a system, process, or object realized as a digital version. Digital twins are widespread in engineering and aim to can help many kinds of organizations simulate real situations and their outcomes, ultimately allowing them to make better decisions. Digital twins combine cutting-edge modelling approaches with powers of supercomputers with data streams. These data resources, coming through the research infrastructures, depend on data standardization, efficient data models and workflows, and on FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) of these elements. Digital twin concepts have been applied to biodiversity data since 2022, most notably through the Biodiversity Digital Twin project. The outcomes of dynamic modeling based on the biodiversity data (which availability changes in volumes and quality) against the globally available changing environmental and human impact data are expected to form the basis for management of natural resources and aims to support biodiversity recovery. The BioDT consortium brings together a dynamic team of experts in biodiversity data and standards, high performance computing, and FAIR data to realize the first set of biodiversity Digital Twin prototypes.
 Biodiversity evidence generated, standardized and shared from collections, systematic and long term surveys, eDNA and metabaroding, citizen science and other communities representing a range of biodiversity evidence types, can to be applied in the dynamic and interactive modelling solutions, known as digital tiwins. The Biodiversity Digital Twin project (and the twin approach in general) offers advanced simulation and prediction models to tackle global biodiversity challenges. This project is designed to address biodiversity dynamics through a set of use cases, providing insights and tools for conservation and restoration efforts. The BioDT project has revealed similarities and differences of applying Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) thinking and principles of data standardization to the communities with different levels of familiarity with standards and FAIR principles.
 The presentation at SPNCH-TDWG 2024 covered the process of building biodiversity digital twins by the second project year and exposed the work along the gradient of data intensity, of data FAIRness, and of complience to the international data standards.

Through Industry 4.0, also referred to as the fourth industrial revolution, new technologies or traditional production resources have been transformed into intelligent objects enhanced by the possibility of identification, scanning, and networking. In recent years, the concept of Industry 5.0 has already started to be discussed. However, is Industry 4.0 an uninteresting or sufficiently researched topic for scientists? The main aim of the scientific article is to perform a bibliometric analysis of the Industry 4.0 issue. The aim was supported by six research questions that reflect the publication trend in the years 2012–2022, the most publishing countries, the most used keywords, the Web of Science category, and authors and publishers. Design / Methodology / Approach. The data was obtained from the renowned Web of Science database. The monitored period was 2012–2022 for Industry 4.0 and 2016-2022 for Industry 5.0. The year 2023 was excluded from the analysis, as the year 2023 is not finished. The total number of publications that were used in the bibliometric analysis was 20,151 (I4.0) and 293 (I5.0). VOSviewer and MS Excel were used for graphical data processing. Findings. The oldest publication dedicated to Industry 4.0 in the Web of Science database dates back to 2012. The most scientific articles were seen in 2021, namely 4,326 (I4.0) and 201 in 2022 about I5.0. In 2022, 3848 publications were published. In addition, authors from Germany (2,450), Italy (2,318), China (1,515), and the USA (1,220) address the issue of Industry 4.0. All the countries of the Visegrad Group, Poland (859), the Czech Republic (859), Slovakia (539), and Hungary (282) are most concerned with this problem. If the publications are divided into categories according to the Web of Science database, most of them are included in the categories Engineering Industrial, Engineering Manufacturing, Engineering Electrical Electronic, Computer Science Theory Methods, or Computer Science Information Systems. Publications on Industry 4.0 are published mainly by publishers such as IEEE, Elsevier, Springer, and MDPI. The authors who are most devoted to the mentioned issue are Popkova, Martinek, Rauch, Bogoviz, Silva, and Xu. Originality / Value / Practical implications. The added value of the scientific article is the summarisation of theoretical starting points from the field of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0.

The problem that often occurs as a conflict in the lecture schedule. Lecturers who teach courses, students cannot take certain courses because the lecture schedule they are taking conflicts with other lecture schedules. The main problem in this research is the design of lecture schedules which always conflict due to room availability and lecturer teaching hours. As a result, lecture scheduling becomes more complicated. The case study used is the scheduling of lectures for the Mathematics Department, Faculty of Science and Technology, UIN Sumatera Utara, Medan in the even semester of the 2022/2023 academic year. In this research, a bipartition graph will be formed based on the variables used, namely determining the variable index used in the course, teaching lecturer, teaching time, entry time, exit time, classroom, number of credits, semester and color. After that, the Welch Powell Algorithm will be used to solve the scheduling problem of a bipartition graph which is formed by creating nodes, membership matrix and the final result is a tabulation of the colored bipartition graph as the output of the scheduling. This algorithm also uses MATLAB software. From the results obtained, the algorithm provides an effective digital solution in designing lecture roster scheduling which is still done manually.

4c0ec10b3aa78796813faad9c93d0b826a9b4484,"The Dream of Mainstream in TDWG, GBIF and SPNHC","The Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG), the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) have been providing nuts and bolts to biodiversity research for decades. Standards service the research community while requiring significant research themselves. Annual conferences gather a rather persistent group of practitioners who showcase the workings and products of the community (Ung and Kampmeier 2022). Is this effort visible to, and recognisable by, potential stakeholders?
 One way to put our groups in perspective is to look at the mainstream scientific production using theirproducts. GBIF has long been keeping track of research using the records it mediates, as well as monitoring the literature citing GBIF itself. TDWG, on the other hand, while also keeping record of its history, does not have a similar mechanism—perhaps because TDWG’s (and SPNHC’s) usual outlets often may not be on a par with the preferred scientific venues: standard, peer-reviewed, indexed papers. Amazingly enough, a huge amount of work seems to be known only through conference abstracts, presentations and posters, which even though actually peer-reviewed, do not truly conform to the ""gold standard"" of scientific publications, and are often contemplated by many actors such as evaluation agencies as merely grey literature representing ""fringe"" research.
 I have attempted to measure how much “mainstreamliness” TDWG, SPNHC and GBIF carry, by looking at how frequently their outputs show up in indexed research along with their citation patterns, and comparing those of other examples both related or unrelated to the three organizations’ remits. 
 METHODS
 In 2024, I queried Web of Science (WoS), Scopus (SC), and Google Scholar (GS) repositories for papers according to each platform’s capabilities, separately targeting (whenever possible) titles, abstracts, keywords, main texts, and references cited (Table 1). 
 Queries were crafted to find output from four groups: one focal (TDWG, GBIF, SPNHC, and the Darwin Core standard, DwC), and three containing examples of related activity or concepts; specific, biodiversity-related research; and unrelated (“outgroup”) general research (Table 2). I kept a tally of hits and other data such as citation numbers, and downloaded (or mined in the case of GS) either the full list of references or a sample, depending on the platform’s limitation.
 Exported references were combined in a database, filtered, and quality-checked. Indexed citation levels were obtained from either complete sets, or 10,000-record samples. The mainstream share was calculated as the quotient between WoS hits and GS hits per query.
 I defined the relative balance, or leverage, of the community’s uptake as:
 leverage = (SCc - SChl) / max[SCcm SChl]
 where SCc is the number of citations reported by Scopus for the indexed hits, and SChl is the number of records found by querying the indexed references’ literature lists (which contain both indexed and non-indexed literature). The index is positive when fringe literature is cited preferentially by fringe literature, negative when fringe literature is disproportionately cited by indexed literature, and zero when there is no uptake selectivity.
 The overlooked (i.e., used but not properly cited) production was estimated from the ratio of papers found by querying titles, keywords and abstracts, and papers found by querying literature citations. Low numbers mean that most indexed papers using certain information get it mostly from other indexed papers and there is little uptake from non-mainstream sources.
 RESULTS
 Data were available for about 9 million (WoS), 16 million (SC), and 23 million (GS) records, of which about 100,000 were used as the analytical sample. 
 GS revealed a flow of focal scholarly products growing at different rates. Detected GBIF output grew exponentially, doubling every 2.9 years, while TDWG and SPNHC have remained approximately constant over the last decade at about 375 and 76 documents per year, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the fraction of indexed output is tiny: 0.5% for TDWG since 2000 (0.8% overall), 0.8%–1% for SPNHC, and 3.9%–3.4% for DwC. GBIF has a higher proportion at 4.9% (recent) and 8.2% (overall). Related products have a recent 5.6% indexed share (6.7% overall), but they are all in stark contrast to other research areas: 62.4% (61.2%) for general concepts, 34.0% (61.2%) for taxonomical terms, and 38.8% (31.6%) for the selected outgroups (Fig. 2).
 The leverage showed a marked difference between focal and related areas, and general areas. TDWG, SPNHC and taxonomical databases had strong indexed leverage: their documents were overly cited in indexed literature. GBIF and standards citations were biased otherwise, being preferentially cited in unindexed literature but less so than all of the comparison terms (except Bioinformatics, neutral) (Fig. 3).
 While almost one-fourth of Scopus-indexed TDWG literature came from conference papers, these tended to be cited in SC-indexed articles rather than other conference papers in a 1:4 ratio. GBIF or DwC showed a more similar distribution of main types (articles, book chapters, conference papers, reviews) between published documents and cited documents.
 A reasonable conclusion is that despite the low proportion of indexed publications by TDWG, SPNHC or GBIF, their products are indeed uptaken by indexed publications, and comparatively much more so than in other areas. Thus, the scientific or technical production by those organizations does have a recognizable impact and should safely be considered de facto part of the mainstream scientific endeavor.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139153', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.139153?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139153, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b1cb311d5da89594c97cf2594f232afeca2701ed,A bibliometric study on Marburg virus research with prevention and control strategies,"Marburg virus (MARV) is a pathogenic zoonotic RNA virus etiologic for Marburg virus disease (MVD), a severe hemorrhagic fever. This is a rare disease, with a high fatality rate, that spreads via infected blood or body fluids or indirectly via fomites (contaminated objects and substances such as clothed, beds, personal protective equipment, or medical equipments). A few vaccines to protect against MARV are undergoing clinical trials, but there is not yet an approved vaccine against this disease. Eventually, prevention and control guidelines should be adhered to rigorously to alleviate this infection. This bibliometric analysis aimed to harness narrative evaluation, emphasizing the significance of quantitative approaches and delineating the most thought-provoking concerns for researchers using VOSviewer software (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, the Netherlands). “Marburg Virus” OR “MARV” AND “Diseases” search criteria were used for the analysis of articles published between 1962 and 2022. Co-occurrence analysis was carried out, which characterized different thematic clusters. From this analysis, we found that 1688 published articles, and the number of publications increased across that period annually, with a growth rate of 8.78%. It is also conspicuous that the number of publications in the United States reached its acme during this period (i.e., 714 publications, accounting for 42.29% of the total), and the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases published the most literature (i.e., 146 papers). Our study found that the three pre-eminent authors of Marburg virus papers were “FELDMANN, HEINZ“ of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, United States, “BECKER, STEPHAN” of the Philipps University of Marburg, Germany, and “GEISBERT, THOMAS W” of the University of Texas Medical Branch, United States. In this study we found that “JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY” has published the most pertinent literature, totaling 88 articles, followed by “The journal of Infectious Diseases”, which published 76 relevant papers, and “VIRUSES”, which published 52 corresponding papers. The most cited paper on the Marburg virus was published in Nature Medicine, with 522 total citations and 29 citations/year.

The three-year worth of RSD observations was collected from four disdrometer stations – namely, Science Garden, Quezon City (SG; 14.6° N, 121.04° E); La Mesa watershed, Quezon City (LM; 14.7° N, 121.07° E); Clark, Pampanga (CK; 15.18° N, 120.5° E); and Malolos, Bulacan (MS; 14.8° N, 120.8° E). Results show significant RSD differences between MS and CK stations. On average, the RSD over the MS station is dominated by a high concentration of relatively smaller raindrops, whereas large raindrops are more prevalent over the CK station. On the other hand, similar RSD properties and integral rainfall parameter (IRP) values were observed over SG and LM. In all the stations, values of mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm) and normalized intercept parameter (Log10 Nw) are higher in convective than stratiform rainfall. However, convective rainfall over the CK station has the highest values of mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm) during the SWM period. The diurnal variation of RSD also showed higher Dm over CK station, especially in the late afternoon to early evening hours. Radar reflectivity–rain rate (Z-R) relations derived from the RSDs at each station showed a clear difference between stratiform and convective rainfall. The Z-R relations obtained from each station are found to be different from the conventional Marshall and Palmer relation but similar to Rosenfeld’s tropical relation. The shape-slope (μ-Λ) relations derived from the gamma RSD are also shown to be distinct at each location. Despite being influenced by a similar synoptic system during the SWM period, the geographical setting of the stations and orography may be the primary reasons for the observed RSD differences.",The Philippine journal of science,2023.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.56899/152.s1.01?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.56899/152.s1.01, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A First Sample of 400 New Quasars at z ∼ 4.7–6.6,"We report the first results of a high-redshift (z ≳ 5) quasar survey using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). As a DESI secondary target program, this survey is designed to carry out a systematic search and investigation of quasars at 4.8 < z < 6.8. The target selection is based on the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (the Legacy Surveys) DR9 photometry, combined with the Pan-STARRS1 data and J-band photometry from public surveys. A first quasar sample has been constructed from the DESI Survey Validation 3 (SV3) and first-year observations until 2022 May. This sample includes more than 400 new quasars at redshift 4.7 ≤ z < 6.6, down to 21.5 magnitude (AB) in the z band, discovered from 35% of the entire target sample. Remarkably, there are 220 new quasars identified at z ≥ 5, more than one-third of existing quasars previously published at this redshift. The observations so far result in an average success rate of 23% at z > 4.7. The current spectral data set has already allowed analysis of interesting individual objects (e.g., quasars with damped Lyα absorbers and broad absorption line features), and statistical analysis will follow the survey’s completion. A set of science projects will be carried out leveraging this program, including quasar luminosity function, quasar clustering, intergalactic medium, quasar spectral properties, intervening absorbers, and properties of early supermassive black holes.

947c613356246b4e67cc5c2f8cb3e29562d45b6b,"Twin-Width of Planar Graphs Is at Most 8, and at Most 6 When Bipartite Planar","Twin-width is a structural width parameter introduced by Bonnet, Kim, Thomassé and Watrigant [FOCS 2020]. Very briefly, its essence is a gradual reduction (a contraction sequence) of the given graph down to a single vertex while maintaining limited difference of neighbourhoods of the vertices, and it can be seen as widely generalizing several other traditional structural parameters. Having such a sequence at hand allows us to solve many otherwise hard problems efficiently. Graph classes of bounded twin-width, in which appropriate contraction sequences are efficiently constructible, are thus of interest in combinatorics and in computer science. However, we currently do not know in general how to obtain a witnessing contraction sequence of low width efficiently, and published upper bounds on the twin-width in non-trivial cases are often “astronomically large”. We focus on planar graphs, which are known to have bounded twin-width (already since the introduction of twin-width), but the first explicit “non-astronomical” upper bounds on the twin-width of planar graphs appeared just a year ago; namely the bound of at most 183 by Jacob and Pilipczuk [arXiv, January 2022], and 583 by Bonnet, Kwon and Wood [arXiv, February 2022]. Subsequent arXiv manuscripts in 2022 improved the bound down to 37 (Bekos et al.), 11 and 9 (both by Hliněný). We further elaborate on the approach used in the latter manuscripts, proving that the twin-width of every planar graph is at most 8, and construct a witnessing contraction sequence in linear time. Note that the currently best lower-bound planar example is of twin-width 7, by Král’ and Lamaison [arXiv, September 2022]. We also prove that the twin-width of every bipartite planar graph is at most 6, and again construct a witnessing contraction sequence in linear time.","International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming",2023.0,18,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2023.75?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2023.75, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These publications are indexed by Scopus, spanning the period from 2014 to 2022, and our analysis utilizes a graph-partitioning based topic modelling approach utilizing the citations of a publication, specifically the publication's cited papers titles. We focus on the top 1 % publications per year, based on citation count, considering the citation count metric as a concrete indicator of the influence a publication has on the community. While the study's findings reveal intriguing insights into the impact of the pandemic and the steady increase of innovation management, our primary contribution lies in the methodology we propose and utilize. This methodology can be readily adapted to examine other fields of study and can accommodate diverse types of publication information, such as abstracts, keywords, and more. Our approach involves constructing a bipartite graph that links publication IDs with their corresponding cited publications' titles keywords. By projecting this graph onto the keyword space, we identify and visually present the underlying topics that emerge from the data. This visualization offers a clear representation of the identified topics, enhancing the overall understanding of the research landscape in the Social Sciences field.","2023 IEEE Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, Intl Conf on Cloud and Big Data Computing, Intl Conf on Cyber Science and Technology Congress (DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech)",2023.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/Cy59711.2023.10361327?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/Cy59711.2023.10361327, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d1643d1ccb1e5b0555340e2acf9356208789b5a0,What is happening in Sweden?,"Sweden has witnessed significant, fast, and sustainable evolution in the optometry profession over the past 3 decades. We recommend a visit to the webpage of Sancta Lucia Gilles for a fantastic compilation of the history of optometry in Sweden — https://www.sanctaluciagille.se/optikeryrkets-historia. In this editorial we share some exciting news about the optometry education and extended responsibilities for optometrists. After about 20 years of solid first-cycle bachelor education, Linnaeus University opened a new master program in optometry and vision sciences in 2021 (Linnaeus University, 2022). From September 2023 the bachelor education at Linnaeus University will be available from Campus Kalmar and Campus Gothenburg. Thatmeans an annual intake of about 75 first-cycle students and up to 25 second-cycle (masters) students per year. With an annual intake of 100 new students Linnaeus University will be a big player in optometry in theNordic countries. In parallel, the responsibilities of Swedish optometrists are expected to be extended by the Swedish authorities. We aim to shed some light on the impact of these developments on optometry education in Sweden and the rest of the Nordic countries. Recognising the evolving healthcare landscape and, probably, appreciating optometrists as a major asset for the chain of eye care, Socialstyrelsen (the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare) is planning to extend optometrists responsibilities. Socialstyrelsen is an agency under the Swedish Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Socialstyrelsen, 2019; 2020) and is responsible for ensuring the quality, accessibility, and equity of healthcare and social services. From January 2024 the main planned changes to the law that controls optometric practice are: (a) optometrists will be allowed to perform eye exams and prescribe refractive correction to children of any age (currently Swedish optometrists cannot prescribe to children under the age of 8 years), (b) the text “optometrists cannot touch the eye” will be removed from the law, and (c) the “contact lens license” will cease to exist as a speciality, that is, all optometrists will be licensed to work with contact lenses. In addition, despite it not being mentioned in the law, the current consensus amongst all eye care professionals is that optometrists must be more selective when referring patients to hospital care.

b4c062888c843a659ce8b1cc0367f1fa87ecdb51,Association of proton pump inhibitors with gastric and colorectal cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are generally considered to be one of the well-established prescription drug classes and are commonly used to treat most acid-related diseases. However, a growing body of literature showing an association between gastric and colorectal cancer risk and PPI use continues to raise concerns about the safety of PPI use. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of gastric and colorectal cancer. Methods: We collected relevant articles using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane library from 1 January 1990 to 21 March 2022. The pooled effect sizes were calculated based on the random-effects model. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022351332). Results: A total of 24 studies (n = 8,066,349) were included in the final analysis in the screening articles. Compared with non-PPI users, PPI users had a significantly higher risk of gastric cancer (RR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.46–2.29), but not colorectal cancer (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.95–1.55). Subgroup analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the use of PPI and the risk of non-cardiac cancer (RR = 2.75, 95% CI: 2.09–3.62). There was a significant trend between the duration dependent effect of PPI use and the risk of gastric cancer (<1 year RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.30–1.86; 1–3 years RR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.28–2.37; >3 years RR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.15–4.66), but not colorectal cancer (≤1 year RR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.78–1.28; >1 year RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.91–1.54; ≥5 years RR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.95–1.17). Conclusion: We found that PPI use increased gastric cancer risk, but not colorectal cancer risk. This result may be biased due to confounding factors. More prospective studies are needed to further validate and support our findings.

However, the prognosis of ICC is unsatisfactory. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and upfront surgery in treating intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The study also intends to explore whether chemotherapy should be introduced before surgery and which populations should be considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Method Four databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, were searched from their inception dates to January 2022 for relevant articles. The statistical analysis was performed using the Review Manager Software (version5.3). The non-randomized interventions (ROBINS-I) was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies and the overall quality of evidence was assessed through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. Moreover, the primary outcomes included 1-year, 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS), while the secondary outcomes were R0 resection, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS), postoperative complications and ninety-day postoperative mortality. Results Five studies involving 2412 patients were included in this meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in 1-year OS, 3-year OS, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year RFS, postoperative complications and ninety-day postoperative mortality between the two groups. However, the meta-analysis showed that the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group had a better 5-year OS benefit in ICC patients than the upfront surgery group (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.58), while the R0 resection rate was lower in neoadjuvant chemotherapy group than that in the upfront surgery group (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.26–0.91). Conclusion Compared with the upfront surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery could prolong the 5-year OS without increasing the risk of postoperative complications in ICC patients. Considering that the patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery group had more advanced ICC cases, the benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be more significant in patients with more advanced ICC.",BMC Gastroenterology,2023.0,12,"{'url': 'https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12876-023-02754-y', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10099833, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These effluents contain xenobiotic compounds that affect both water and soil ecosystem. Methods: The research has been performed at Parul Institute of Applied Sciences laboratory, Waghodia, Gujarat in the year 2022. Pots were filled with mycorrhizal soil spiked with methylene blue dye at various concentrations and pinch of iron oxide nanoparticle was spread over all pots except the control one. About 10 marigold seeds were sown per pot which were kept in green house for 3 months. After this, soil samples were collected and biodegradation of methylene blue dye was assessed by HPLC and GCMS technique in the lab. Result: This research focuses on biodegradation of methylene blue dye on formation of mineral nano particle which is already available in soil as micronutrient i.e iron. Iron has been converted into nanoparticle i.e iron oxide which will act as nutrient supplement for the plants. Mycorrhizal association with iron oxide nano particle proved to be beneficial for plants by alleviating the adverse effects of methylene blue dye and ceasing soil pollution.

It made use of the descriptive correlational research design to describe the characteristics of the respondents in terms of sex, age, year level, and person or persons who raise and take care of their family; the parental pressure they experienced; the academic performance they accomplished; and the strength and direction of relationship between parental pressure and academic performance. This study was conducted in Notre Dame of Midsayap College, Midsayap, Cotabato, Philippines during the second semester of academic year 2022-2023. It included as respondents thirty-two purposively selected honor students at the College of Arts and Sciences. They were 21 to 28 years old, majority of whom were females, and mostly graduating students. Either their father, mother, brother or sister or both raise and take care of their family. Findings revealed that the respondents had experienced high level of parental pressure with respect to expectations, rewards and penalty, support and encouragement, and setting rules and standards; while they experienced moderate level of parental pressure with respect to monitoring, and comparison. Moreover, they strongly agreed that the acts or practices of their parents of explaining to them the importance of sacrifices to earn a career, of reminding them of their studies as preparation for their future work, and of expressing joy when they perform well in their studies had put pressure in them to do well in their study. A few of the respondents had accomplished excellent academic performance although most of them had accomplished good academic performance. There is a weak and negative relationship between parental pressure and academic performance, implying either that too much parental pressure could cause negative effect on the academic performance of their children, or that the very low academic performance of children could prompt parents to put more parental pressure over them. Nonetheless, the strength and direction of relationship between these variables was not significant, implying that the observed relationship occurred merely by chance, and not true to the population of interest – the college students.",International journal of research and innovation in social science,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47772/ijriss.2023.7011054?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2023.7011054, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6802c96107ea5b6370a61a3ccafa556b9d0362e4,Article processing charges of health professions category journals in SCOPUS,"Introduction and aim: Scientific journals are a key communication channel for the transmission of scientific information, and the publication of articles is mandatory in scientific advancements. Open access publishing enables greater visibility of scientific outputs but publication in open access is rarely free (Van Norden, 2013; Pourret 2022). The aim of this research is to examine the article processing charges (APCs) of journals in the Health professions category within the SCOPUS database, along with their respective business models (hybrid, OA or diamond OA).Methods: We collected data on journals using Scimago, DOAJ and Sherpa Romeo databases, as well as the homepages of journals and publishers. Using the SCImago Journal & Country Rank data for the year 2022, we filtered journals belonging to the field and category of ""Health Professions (miscellaneous)"". Data were gathered on the number of journals in Scopus, the type of journal (hybrid, open access, diamond journal) and the cost for publishing (APC) an original scientific article/review article in open access. Information about the type of the journal was collected in Sherpa Romeo/DOAJ databases, information on the APCs was found on the pages of the journal or publisher.Results: A total of 60 journals belonging to the category of Health professions in Scopus were identified, with 28 (47%) of them also in the Web of Science database according to Scimago. Of these 60 journals, 28 are hybrid journals, 32 are in open access (53%), including 10 in open access with an APC, and 22 completely free - diamond journals. The publication cost in all journals is in the range from €0 to €3,385.00, with an average median price of €788 (ranging from €0 to €2,895). The average APC is significantly lower in open access journals than in hybrid journals (median €881, ranging from €92 to €2466, versus €2895, ranging from €2045 to €2977), which is in line with previously published results in the medical field (Siler et al, 2018). Most of the diamond journals are in the 3rd (6 out of 22) and 4th quartiles (9 out of 22) or have only recently (3 out of 22) been included in the Scopus database.Limitations of the study: The study sample is small, and has only 60 journals, while there could be more journals connected with health professions in other Scopus categories. Information about waivers was not collected.Conclusion: Journals of the 1st and 2nd quartile, which are considered an important criterion for advancement in the biomedical field, are mostly hybrid journals and the APCs are very high. Consequently, the conclusion emerges that health professions do not have a large selection of journals for publishing in open access, and therefore it is necessary to educate authors to self-archive their articles.",PUBMET - Conference Scholarly Publishing Context Open Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://morepress.unizd.hr/journals/index.php/pubmet/article/download/4275/5007', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15291/pubmet.4275?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15291/pubmet.4275, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8d3b30d7cefd7d67a630adbd92c1fbfb6e31dab9,Effect of Oxalic Acid on Control of Post-harvest Browning of Litchi (Litchi chinensis L.),"Post-harvest browning of litchi is a common phenomenon that occurs due to enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. Enzymatic browning is primarily caused by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, leading to the formation of brown pigments. Non-enzymatic browning is caused by the Maillard reaction between reducing sugars and amino acids. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and mechanical damage can accelerate browning. Proper handling, storage, and the use of antioxidants can help minimize post-harvest browning, extending the shelf life and maintaining the visual appeal of litchi fruits. The present investigation was laid out in the post-harvest laboratory of horticulture department, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj during the year 2022-2023.

It comes with the difficulties of conducting the teaching-learning process and achieving the students’ comprehension and understanding of the subjects, especially science. It is worsened by the thematic learning model, where students are required to understand more than one learning concept in one learning sub-theme. The offline teaching, which is scheduled in the first semester of the 2021/2022 academic year is a momentum to reshape the thinking concept of elementary school students. One of the concerns is physics. Physics is very important in the development of student knowledge, because of its continuous application in everyday life. In addition, the use of natural science in secondary schools is wide. Another important point is that students have less ability to understand new knowledge. Therefore, practice is needed to support the learning of theories. Considering this problem, the team of community service of Engineering Faculty Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang used magnetic and electric kits to explain the concept of energy and force to students. These topics are difficult for students, and they need to learn them with direct practice. Learning using the physics kits, magnet and electric, made students can understand better the basic concepts of magnetism and electricity. Moreover, students can practice their motoric skills using the kits. Students can also develop their creativity and innovation by varying the experiments with the kits. Lots of practice with magnets and electric kits helped teachers to evaluate students’ ability and absorption of the materials.

This study aims to determine the effect of social science learning outcomes on students when an active the learning cell learning strategy is applied using card media in class VII at SMP Negeri 1 Gempol, Cirebon Regency, for the academic year 2021/2022. This type of research is quasi-experimental. The research population consisted of 64 students consisting of class VII A to VII G. Sampling was determined using purposive sampling and the selected ones were VII A (as the control class) and class VII B (as the experimental class). The research data was obtained using a questionnaire instrument that included how to apply the steps of the active the learning cell strategy with the aid of card media, along with pre-test and post-test research instruments to determine student learning outcomes. From the results of the study, it is known that in the distribution of the questionnaire the application of the active the learning cell strategy got an average score of 91.75%. The score of 91.75% is in the ""very good"" criteria. so that the implementation of the active the learning cell strategy steps with the help of card media goes very well. The average pre-test value of the experimental class before treatment was 47.97 and the average post-test value of the experimental class after being given treatment was 81.97. The average score for the control class is 49.03 and the average post-test score for the control class is 73.66.  Thus, when viewed from the post test scores of the two classes, the experimental class using the active the learning cell strategy is more effective in improving students' social studies learning outcomes. And based on the results of the paired sample t test to determine the effect of student learning outcomes, the sig value of 000.0 <0.05 means Ha is rejected and H0 is accepted. So it can be said that there are differences in the learning outcomes of the two classes. This means that there is an influence on learning outcomes by using the active the learning cell strategy.

Beyond this period, the virtual learning environment proposed a reevaluation of curriculum design and didactic strategies. The Classroom Laboratory NTNU-WUT Joint Course (CL) was introduced as a novel learning experience for students at West University of Timisoara (WUT) and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). This experimental course was proposed as part of the Romania-Norway collaboration and incorporates Virtual Project Based Learning (VPBL) in cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary online learning groups. This study aims to describe the learning experiences of Romanian students enrolled at WUT in the CL course during the 2021 – 2022 academic year. In a quasi-experimental design, 24 Romanian students participated in a seven-week transversal CL course, collaborating with Norwegian peers to develop a solution for a social problem. •• Students made significant gains in all three dimensions targeted by VPBL: skill development, self-regulation of learning, and group interactions in the online environment. In addition, the learning of students was compared based on the field of science they are pursuing (STEM and non-STEM). The results indicate that students enrolled in STEM disciplines demonstrated greater benefits from this instructional approach, as evident in their progress across the three dimensions of PBL. The qualitative analysis of the students' journals reveals a positive learning experience in terms of knowledge acquisition, skill development, and affective engagement.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and indications for primary Caesarean section in multiparous women who had one or more previous vaginal births, as well as to assess the maternal and neonatal outcomes. Methods: A prospective observational study of primary Caesarean section in Parous women with prior vaginal delivery for one year at our institute from 25 May 2022 toJune 10 2023 at Srinivas institute of medical sciences and research centre, MUKKA, Mangalore at department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Results: There was total of 487 Caesarean section out of 1192 total deliveries with 68 primary Caesarean section in Parous women were done. The most common age group were 21 - 30 (83.8%). The majority group were para - 2 (55.8%). The most common indication for Caesarean section was fetal heart rate abnormalities (41.18%) followed by failed induction (16.18) and malpresentation (11.76%). The maximum number of cases were in MRC - 3 (61.76%). Among this group (10.29%) had postpartum complications. Conclusion: Previous vaginal delivery gives a false sense of security but they may need caesarean section In future pregnancy.

Research methods: We conducted a cross -sectional study between August and December 2022. This study was included 526 subjects with hypertension aged from 35- to 64 years, who had no clinical symptoms of heart failure. Cardiovascular risk factors were detected by clinical examinations and laboratory test. Hypertension was defined as systolic BP ≥ 130 mm Hg, diastolic BP ≥ 80 mm Hg, and/or receiving treatment with anti-hypertensive agents. NT-pro BNP determination was performed on an immunoassay analyzer (Getein 1100). An elevated NT-pro BNP was defined as a NT-pro BNP ≥ 125pg/ml. Pre-heart failure was based on elevated NT-pro BNPlevel. Ethical statement Research ethical permission was obtained from the Biomedical Ethics Committee of Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences. Research results: In total, 526 hypertensive subjects s aged 35-64 year enrolled in this study, of which, 243 (46.2%) were men and mean age was 52.5±7.7 years. The prevalence of pre-heart failure based on NT-pro BNP in women was non-significantly higher than in men(17.3% vs 14.0%, p= 0.297). The prevalence of pre-heart failure increased from 4.0% for men aged 35-44 years to 20.9% for men aged 55-64 years. Based on our logistic regression analysis, the likelihood of elevated NT-pro BNP in hypertensive subjects was independently associated with age(OR 2.18, 95%CI 1.51-3.14) and poor blood pressure control(OR 2.41, 95%CI 1.29-4.50). Conclusion: The present study showed that the overall prevalence of pre-heart failure in hypertensive subjects was 15.8% and increased with age.

In education, it is viewed as a novel and innovative teaching strategy to use for augmenting the writing skills of the students. To ascertain such contention, this study explores the effectiveness of online blogging in enhancing the writing skills of Senior High School’ Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) students. The researcher employed quasi-experimental research design to examine the effectiveness of online blogging as compared to traditional writing. Grade 11 HUMSS students of Balite National High School (n=13 for experimental group, and n=13 for control group) for the 2nd semester of school year 2021-2022, comprised the respondents for this study.To collect the data, the researcher used an Assessment Writing Test in essay form as an instrument. There was a pre-test that was held before the researcher gave treatment to the experimental class and a post-test, which was held afterward. To make the data analysis, the researcher analyzed the data by using mean and independent t-test. The findings indicated that there was significant difference in the level of writing competencies as to focus and details, voice, and grammar and mechanics of the students but in other writing competencies such as organization and word choice there wasno significant difference in their pretest and posttest performance. Generally, the integration of online blogging was found better and more effective than the traditional method. Results suggested that the participants have positive perception and attitude towards online blogging, viewed this as a tool in improving their writing skills, and kept them motivated. Finally, this study recommends that online blogging should be part of the writing classes and be incorporated in lesson planning and designing curricula in senior high school.","International Journal of Advanced Research in Science, Communication and Technology",2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.48175/ijarsct-11923', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.48175/ijarsct-11923?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.48175/ijarsct-11923, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: All award data were collected from NIH RePORTER. All K99 awards and funding data in this study were limited to All Clinical Departments (ACD). All researchers (n = 1,148) and awards (n = 2,022) were identified through a K99 search from FY 2007 to FY 2022 across ACD. Historic trends in K99 awards and funding from NIH Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 to FY 2022 were investigated. An R00 dataset was generated from NIH RePORTER. The K99 to R00 achievement statistics from FY 2007 to FY 2022 was investigated. NIH annual datafiles for FY 2007 to FY 2021 were aggregated to generate a master datafile of all R01 (n = 395,505) and R21 awards (n = 61,766). R01 and R21 award data were linked to the researcher previously identified through the K99 search. The connection between K99/R00 awardees and subsequent R01 or R21 awards was focused on. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: From FY 2008 to FY 2022, the number of K99 awards per year increased 123.4%, from 94 to 210. Over the same period, after correcting for inflation, the NIH K99 budget increased 127.0% while the NIH program level budget increased 17.3%. For researchers who achieved their first R01 or R21 0–3 years versus 3–6 years after the start of their R00, their average funding per year since the start of the R00 phase was $467,425 versus $290,604, respectively (p < 0.001). In summary, NIH investment in the K99 award pathway has substantially outpaced the NIH program level budget increase, and there is a strong relationship between average funding per year since the start of the R00 phase and time from R00 to R01 or R21.

9a4a34af6c5586537e8a4fbedeb2110aadc4c047,EXAMINATION OF PARENTS' FAMILY NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ATTITUDES IN TERMS OF VARIOUS DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES (ELAZIĞ EXAMPLE),"Individuals who do not have balanced nutrition during childhood encounter the problem of obesity. The most important environmental risk factors in the emergence of obesity are: changing dietary habits, increased screen time spent with technological devices such as computers, tablets, phones, and televisions, adopting a sedentary lifestyle as a result, and a decrease in physical activity. In addition, factors such as increased academic stress on children, socio-economic level, and residing in major cities are also risk factors. In line with this information, the purpose of our research is to examine the relationship between parents' family nutrition and physical activity attitudes and the eating behaviors of high school students. First, the universe was determined in our study, followed by the use of the general survey model from quantitative research methods. Parents of 375 high school students studying in the 2022-2023 academic year participated in the research. The relationships between the variables in our research were analyzed statistically. The ""Family Nutrition and Physical Activity Screening Scale"" (Özdemir, 2020) was used to collect data. Our application form consists of two sections. The first section contains the demographic information form containing the data to be collected from the participants. The second section contains the scale form to be used in the research. The scale consists of five sub-dimensions: physical activity, parental behaviors, unhealthy eating habits, healthy food intake, and sedentary behaviors, restriction/reward sub-dimensions. SPSS 21 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) was used in the study. First, the analysis of descriptive statistical data of the participant group was performed. Then, the internal consistency coefficient was calculated. After that, t-tests and ANOVA tests were conducted to analyze the differentiation of scale results. Under the Post-Hoc heading, the Tukey test was performed for scale scores showing homogeneous distribution, and the direction of differentiation was determined. In the research, when the average values of the groups were examined, it was observed that the family nutrition and physical activity attitudes of males were higher than those of females. There was no significant differentiation for variables such as age, class, monthly income status, school type, success status, and parental education status. When the variable data on breakfast habits were examined, it was found that the participants who answered ""I have breakfast at home"" significantly differed from those who answered ""I have breakfast at school"" and ""I do not have breakfast.""",SOCIAL SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31567/ssd.1060?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31567/ssd.1060, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Limitations: This study looks into the implementation of the spiral progression approach and assesses its volatilities, uncertainties, complexities, and ambiguities (VUCA) as a way to cope with its complex conditions as perceived by science teachers and serves as variables of the study. Respondents of the study were limited only to those teachers teaching secondary science in the school year 2021-2022. Contribution: This research endeavor will be beneficial as it aims to add knowledge on the implementation of the Spiral Progression Approach with a special focus on its volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity which will become the basis of future programs and policies to illuminate the current set of understanding about this educational reform program.",Journal of Social Humanity and Education,2023.0,9,"{'url': 'https://goodwoodpub.com/index.php/jshe/article/download/1194/371', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.35912/jshe.v3i2.1194?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.35912/jshe.v3i2.1194, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

84c0ab267ecdb10f4f1f3b985b8546376085e493,A systematic review and meta-analysis of cemented and uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients over 60 years old,"Background Currently, whether bone cement can be applied in bipolar hemiarthroplasty to treat femoral neck fractures (FNFs) in elderly patients is controversial. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the effectiveness and safety of cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty (CBH) versus uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty (UCBH) in the treatment of FNFs among elderly patients over 60 years old. Materials and methods The Pubmed, Web of science, Cochrane Library and EMBASE databases were searched comprehensively for relevant articles from their inception to May 2022. Studies about comparing outcomes between CBH and UCBH for FNFs in elderly patients aged more than 60 years were included. Outcomes including operation time, intra-operative blood loss, length of hospital stay, wound infections, residual pain, revisions, re-operations, complications related to prosthesis, general complications, and mortality. The Review Manager 5.3 software provided by the Cochrane Collaboration Network was used to perform the meta-analysis of comparable data. Results A total of 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 9 observational studies were included in this analysis, with 33,118 patients (33,127 hips). Results of the meta-analysis indicated that the operation time [WMD = 13.01 min, 95% CI (10.79, 15.23)], intra-operative blood loss [WMD = 80.57 ml, 95% CI (61.14, 99.99)], incidence of heterotrophic ossification [OR = 2.07, 95% CI (1,14, 3.78)], were increased in the CBH group but the incidence of intra-operative fractures [OR = 0.24, 95% CI (0.07, 0.86)], periprosthetic fractures [OR = 0.24, 95% CI (0.18, 0.31)], aseptic loosening of prosthesis [OR = 0.20, 95% CI (0.09, 0.44)], wound infections [OR = 0.80, 95% CI (0.68, 0.95)] and re-operation rates [OR = 0.61, 95% CI (0.54, 0.68)] were lower in the CBH group by comparison with the UCHB group. However, there were no significant differences in residual pain, length of hospital stay, prosthetic dislocation, prosthetic subsidence (> 5 mm), acetabulum erosion, revisions, pulmonary infections, pulmonary embolisms, urinary tract infections, deep venous thromboses, decubitus, cardiovascular accidents (arrhythmia/myocardial infarction), and respiratory failure between the two groups. In terms of mortality, perioperative mortality (within 72 h) [OR = 2.39, 95% CI (1.71, 3.32)] and 1-week mortality postoperatively [OR = 1.22, 95% CI (1.05, 1.41)] in CBH group were higher than those in UCBH group, but there were no significant differences in mortality at 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively between CBH group and UCBH group. Conclusion This meta-analysis found that elderly patients over 60 years old with FNFs who underwent CBH had longer operation time, higher incidence of heterotrophic ossification, intra-operative blood loss, and mortality within 72 h of operation and at 1-week postoperatively, but lower incidence of periprosthetic fractures, aseptic loosening of prosthesis, intra-operative fractures, wound infections and re-operations.

8a138ba26bcd500fa735a63223009d11d87f0dc6,"Bioactive compounds of acacia, health benefits and its utilization in food processing industry: a critical review","
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to review phytochemical potential of acacia and its associated health advantages. Acacia a moderate-sized, deciduous tree and recognised as health-promoting species because of availability of essential bioactive components. The bioactive compounds such as tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, fatty acids and polysaccharides (gums) present in the plant parts of acacia, namely, bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, twigs and seeds, have medicinal value and thus are used to overlay the formulations of plant-based drugs and value-added foods.


Design/methodology/approach
Major well-known bibliometric information sources such as Web of Science, Scopus, Mendeley and Google Scholar were searched with keywords such as “nutrition value of acacia”, “bioactive compounds”, “health benefits”, “processing and safety” were chosen to obtain a database of 1,428 papers. The search considered papers in the English language from the past 18 years of publication in journals (2004–2022). The article selection process consisted of the screening of titles and abstracts, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles that did not have acacia components as a study objective were taken into consideration for exclusion. A final database of 87 scientific sources was made after sorting and classifying them according to different criteria based on topic relevance, country of origin and year of publication. Articles with other random descriptors were also searched to complement the discussion of the results obtained.


Findings
The literature reflected that acacia contains all necessary phytochemicals like polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, glucosinolates, alkaloids and carotenoids along with essential macro, micro-nutrients. Furthermore, processing methods such as soaking, cooking, roasting and dehusking significantly reduced the anti-nutritional factors present in acacia seeds of different species. This review also focused on the processing methods that are used to eliminate or lower down the anti-nutritional factors from the seeds. Previous findings related to acacia plant parts with respect to food development are explored and mentioned.


Originality/value
This review emphasised mainly on recent studies that had been reported on ethnomedical acacia plants therapeutically, commercially and exponentially for further studies to increase the utilisation in food processing.

86a72bcf0890a93962d29c12c069737d9b2ebf71,A meta-analytic investigation of the impact of middle school STEM education: where are all the students of color?,"Background Integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education initiatives are becoming an increasingly popular approach to narrow the opportunity gap among underrepresented minority (i.e., Black, Hispanic, and first-generation) students. However, there are limited studies on the impact of exposure to integrated STEM education on academic achievement and an even lesser amount on performance among underrepresented minority (URM) groups. Students exposed to STEM programming in middle school are more likely to pursue a STEM field in college or a STEM-related career. However, despite increases in middle school STEM programming initiatives, STEM college graduation rates have declined, particularly among URM populations. This meta-analysis aims to determine the effectiveness of STEM education in middle school, focusing on URM students. Results A total of 20 studies containing 45 independent samples met the study criteria. The studies included were published from January 1, 2011 to May 1, 2022, and identified from the following academic databases: ERIC, Google Scholar, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and SCOPUS. Integrated STEM programming was most impactful when: engineering was incorporated into science courses and at full STEM integration, occurring over one academic year ( d  = 0.89) and occurring in 8th grade ( d  = 1.55). Overall, the effect size estimate demonstrated heterogeneity, with a large positive significant effect across the studies (d  = 0.558, 95% CI [0.514–0.603], p  < 0.001), indicating a significant impact on student achievement. The most notable finding was the lack of empirical studies involving URM groups, with only one effect size estimate reported for Black students and other minority groups and 40 effect size estimates for non-minority groups revealing a non-significant difference in effect size estimates. Conclusions Students benefit from STEM program participation, with the average STEM student outperforming approximately 70% of their same-age, same-grade peers not participating in STEM programming. In particular, URM students benefit even more from quality integrated STEM education initiatives, given one caveat—students must be given the opportunity. We conclude that the issue is not that URM students are not academically benefiting from middle school integrated STEM education programs, based on the available research—they are merely not participating. We highlight the need and suggest interventions for providing collaborative and focused attention on the societal and cultural factors impacting URM student participation and retention in integrated STEM education programs.",International Journal of STEM Education,2023.0,9,"{'url': 'https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40594-023-00425-8', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1186/s40594-023-00425-8?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1186/s40594-023-00425-8, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d6cd5dd4ef5b0301cb78202f6641800cd70901c2,The UWI Zoology Museum and Bioblitzing in Trinidad & Tobago: Mutual Benefits,"In 2012, as Zoology Curator for the University of the West Indies Zoology Museum (UWIZM), based at the St. Augustine campus in Trinidad and Tobago, I ran the first ever bioblitz to be held in Trinidad. Since then, an event has been conducted annually. Each event is organised mainly by staff and students in The University of the West Indies (UWI) Department of Life Sciences alongside members of the Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists' Club (TTFNC). A typical event would follow this basic format: choose a new location each year, find a basecamp, set up a search area (usually a 5 km radius circle), promote the event, organise survey teams, start surveying on a Saturday, invite the public along on a Sunday to get involved and then announce the results.
 Over the years, the bioblitzes have been attended and/or assisted by more than 30 groups and organisations. These included long-established bodies such as the Asa Wright Nature Centre, the Pointe-a-Pierre Wildfowl Trust, and the Zoological Society of Trinidad and Tobago; government bodies like the Institute of Marine Affairs, the Forestry Division and the Environmental Management Authority; and newer, smaller groups such as Trinibats, Turtle Village Trust, Environmental Research Institute Charlotteville (ERIC), the Reptile Conservation Center Of Trinidad and Tobago and The El Socorro Centre for Wildlife Conservation (ECWC) (Fig. 1).
 The way these groups contributed to the events varied from being basecamp hosts to providing animal encounter experiences, and from granting access to land and giving permits to providing expert wildlife surveyors. Organisations were usually approached by me with an invitation to join a bioblitz, depending on the needs and location of the event. Sponsors for the events were found by writing to local companies, approaching those who already had community funding programmes in place.
 I left the role of UWIZM curator in 2019, but the Trinidad and Tobago Bioblitz continued and evolved. In 2019, it followed the same pattern as previous events: the organisers partnered with a local school for a basecamp and the usual participants surveyed and welcomed the public. However, in 2020 with the first COVID lockdown, they had to adapt and so changed the bioblitz into an event facilitated online by using the iNaturalist platform: T&T Bioblitz 2020 Backyard Edition. At this stage, people were restricted to their gardens or streets so observation opportunities were limited, but nevertheless there were around 6,500 observations made of almost 1,400 species over one weekend in November.
 In 2021, restrictions were still in place for large gatherings but people could travel more widely, so the same online format was repeated. Observations could be made in some of the locations of previous events, which led to 2,900 observations and just over 1,000 species. For 2022, the event stayed online but became the Inter-Island Bioblitz as it went regional with participants from Jamaica and Barbados being invited. Almost 600 people took part and recorded over 1,300 species. Finally, in 2023, the bioblitz returned to the original format and an in-person event was again possible; this continued into 2024.
 The recording of results changed over the years. For example, the use of iNaturalist went from 9 observations in 2012 to over 6,500 observations in 2020. As I was no longer resident in Trinidad, I couldn't take part directly but though iNaturalist, I could contribute by identifying observations, as could many other international identifiers. 
 The majority of records made during the events were observations rather than the collection of specimens, but for some groups it was necessary to collect for further identification. Specimens collected were mostly terrestrial invertebrates, although sometimes roadkill and other specimens found dead during the events were also added to the UWIZM collections.
 After each bioblitz, a large banner was produced showing a summary of the results (Fig. 2). These were displayed at subsequent events and also as part of other displays in the UWIZM. Likewise, the trails and quizzes made for the bioblitzes were often used during the rest of the year for school groups visiting the UWIZM.
 Both in the lead up to a bioblitz and in the weeks following the event, the results are promoted in several ways: on social media (Facebook at first and later Instagram and Twitter), in national newspapers, on TV (usually getting a slot on a morning show), and through the TTFNC's Quarterly Bulletin, the final edition of the year being dedicated to that year's bioblitz. A T&T bioblitz website was made, which allowed us to collate all these outputs as well as access to the final reports for each event.
 Bioblitzes are fantastic events that bring together naturalist experts and the public. They should be a part of any natural history museum's repertoire, helping to promote and popularise the museum, as well as often providing a first exposure of citizen science to people, which can lead to a lifelong connection with nature (Fig. 3).",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.137368', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.137368?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.137368, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

946874a1d3849235b8db8f5abc98378d733e1a60,Multilayer perceptron modeling for social dysfunction prediction based on general health factors in an Iranian women sample,"In the year 2022, this research conducted an in-person study involving 780 single or widowed women, aged between 20 and 70, falling within the bottom three economic deciles and possessing varying levels of education. All participants held educational qualifications below a high school diploma and were beneficiaries of charitable financial support in Khorasan province, Iran. The study aimed to investigate the predictive factors of social dysfunction in this specific demographic. Data collection spanned a 12-month period throughout 2022, with participants completing the GHQ-28 questionnaire during their visits to the charity office. Clinical in-person interviews were also conducted to gather comprehensive data. Data analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS version 27. The research employed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model, considering an extensive set of input factors and covariates. These factors included cognitive functioning, anxiety, depression, age, and education levels. The MLP model exhibited robust performance, achieving high overall accuracy and sensitivity in identifying cases of high social dysfunction. The findings emphasized the significance of cognitive functioning, anxiety, and depression as pivotal predictors of social dysfunction within this specific demographic, while education and age displayed relatively lower importance. The normalized importance scores provided a relative measure of each covariate’s impact on the model’s predictions. These results furnish valuable insights for the development of targeted interventions and evidence-based policies aimed at addressing social dysfunction and promoting societal well-being among economically disadvantaged, single or widowed women. Notably, the research underscores the potential of MLP modeling in social science research and suggests avenues for further research and refinement to enhance the model’s predictive accuracy, particularly for cases of low social dysfunction.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2023.0,4,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1283095/pdf?isPublishedV2=False', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10756140, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Research shows that entrepreneurial activity is particularly high in more developed countries. However, the significance of entrepreneurship extends beyond developed nations to encompass less developed ones as well. The role of women in entrepreneurship stands as a pivotal issue requiring examination in the context of economic development and gender equality. Therefore, it is paramount to diversify research on women's entrepreneurship and provide support for studies in this field. The main purpose of this study is to examine and evaluate articles on women’s entrepreneurship in the Web of Science (WoS) database using bibliometric analysis. The study includes 4301 articles on women’s entrepreneurship published in the WoS database between 1990 and 2023. To achieve this goal, the articles were analyzed by year of publication, language, country, and other relevant factors. According to the main results obtained from the study, it was found that the highest number of articles were published in 2022, with the majority of them being written in English. The results of the study have revealed that the number of publications on women’s entrepreneurship in the Turkic republics of Central Asia is significantly inadequate.

ff37063a93229433d92652a95b6eec5b6c06bfb4,Beyond Trial and Error: A Comprehensive Classification of Metaheuristics along with Metaphor Criterion Development Trend,"Objectives: The research aims to develop a comprehensive classification system for metaheuristics, categorize metaphor metaheuristics, and present the development trend and percentage representation of metaphor metaheuristics within each metaphor group. Method: A descriptive-based systematic review was conducted to collect data on studies concerning the classification of metaheuristics and the proposal of new metaheuristics. Data was sourced from Google Scholar, Science Direct, Springer, ResearchGate, and IEEE Xplore. For the first research objective, 148 studies were screened, resulting in the selection of six studies. The second and third research objectives involved screening 1145 studies, of which 654 were ultimately selected. This review considers studies published up to August 2023. The extracted data includes the characteristics of each classification and the name, abbreviation, author, year, and metaphor group for each metaheuristic reviewed. Findings: The results reveal that existing classifications do not cover the full range of metaheuristic characteristics. The data indicates a rising trend in the introduction of new metaheuristics over the years, with the peak occurring in 2020, boasting 68 new approaches, closely followed by 2022 with 57 introductions. However, between 1965 and 1992, progress was limited to only one or two new approaches annually, signifying periods of stagnation in the field. The majority of metaheuristics proposed are in the physics-chemistry metaphor group (20%), followed closely by human metaheuristics (18%).

0acdaf6647be961059bb14bb6b06f8eae9f860b9,How Science Gets Drawn Into Global Conspiracy Narratives,"A few short years ago, mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) was the subject of fundamental research, but it is now known as the basis for COVID-19 vaccines. At the same time, the concept has become linked—particularly on social media—to global conspiracy theories attributing nefarious motives to people associated with science. How did this happen? In our work, we use social media data to track evolving narratives empirically. By analyzing the terms that have become associated with mRNA on Twitter since early 2020, we have gained insight into how seemingly innocuous scientific concepts acquire sinister connotations through association. Understanding how this process occurs can be helpful in determining which countermeasures might be effective. Hashtags are key to this analysis. Used to cross-link social media posts, hashtags generally consist of a word preceded by a pound symbol: #mRNA, for example. Hashtags make such concepts easier to find because they can be easily searched. By observing how hashtags co-occur over time, we learn how ideas are linked to each other on social media. This approach is useful for understanding the ways in which disparate concepts become related to evolving narratives. To find out how the term mRNA became connected to farflung conspiracy theories, we collected a sample of 87,000 tweets containing the hashtag #mRNA over the three-year period from early 2020 to the end of 2022. This allowed us to look at how mRNA was juxtaposed with other ideas on social media over that time. Our analysis looks at time continuously, but we’ve found it helpful to take “slices” from the dataset to highlight the way the narrative took shape and then shifted over time. We looked at where #mRNA occurred next to other hashtags, which gives a sense of how the term became connected to other ideas. We presented this data visually, displaying the connections as a network where each node represents a different hashtag and each edge represents the number of times two hashtags co-occur in our dataset. Starting with tweets using the hashtag #mRNA, this method allows us to see how sometimes unexpected semantic networks of associations can develop around ideas. Although co-occurring hashtags should not be taken as representing general discussions about mRNA, their changing patterns over time may offer insights into how issues may be hijacked and misinformation spread. In our first sample, from early 2020, the hashtags cooccurring with #mRNA were largely scientific or financial, reflecting prepandemic views. To make this network graph more readable, we “cleaned” the data, systematically removing all hashtag nodes above and below certain thresholds determined by number of connections. The distance between nodes indicates how often terms are used together in posts, and the size of the text reflects the sum of its connections. Thus, larger text shows terms that are highly interconnected. The color coding reflects which communities are involved, which is discovered through an automated process that examines connections. The first figure depicts a mostly pale green community made up of hashtags corresponding to scientific terms as well as a gray colored community devoted to discussing biotech investment. These figures make it possible to examine how the narrative around mRNA evolved over time. As vaccines went into production, new semantic networks associated with the term quickly began to develop. One cannot simply assume this method represents all the opinions that are “out there” in society, but it can nevertheless be quite helpful in MARC TUTERS, TOM WILLAERT, AND TRISHA MEYER REAL NUMBERS",Issues in science and technology,2023.0,3,"{'url': 'https://issues.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/32-36-Tuters-et-al.-Real-Numbers-Spring-2023.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.58875/pozr1536?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.58875/pozr1536, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

12c410be57238f699c6735ce987c9712c59335b7,PSII-7 Is Scrotal Ultrasound a Useful Tool in Ram Breeding Soundness examination?,"
 Varicocele, a condition of abnormally dilated veins within the pampiniform plexus, is associated with reduced male fertility in several species but its frequency and impact in rams is not well documented. Semen was collected and pampiniform plexus ultrasound performed in early December during breeding soundness examinations (BSE) of mature Composite-IV rams over a three-year study. A portion of rams were evaluated in multiple years and data from a total of 129 collections on 90 rams were available for analyses. Semen parameters were estimated by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Imaging software was used to quantify the cross-sectional area of five vessels per testis and average areas of the left testis (AAL), right testis (AAR), and both testes (AAT) were calculated. The correlation between AAL and AAR measured on the same ram within a year was moderate and positive (0.51; P < 0.001). However, correlations between AAL, AAR, and AAT measured on the same ram in consecutive years were not different from zero. Average vessel area was analyzed with fixed effects of testis side (AAL or AAR), year (2020, 2021, or 2022), ram age (2, 3, or ≥ 4 yr-old) and a random effect of ram. Across years, AAL was 23 to 25% greater than AAR and 16 to 18% greater in ≥ 4-yr-old than younger rams (P < 0.01). Unilateral varicocele (UV) was diagnosed when AAL/AAR or AAR/AAL ratio exceeded 1.5 in a ram and, for rams sampled in multiple years, those diagnosed in one year were considered affected for all subsequent years. Within year, prevalence of UV ranged from 16 to 36%. Scrotal circumference (SC) and CASA parameters were analyzed with fixed effects of year, ram age, and UV status and a random effect of ram. Within 2- and 3-yr-olds, sperm from UV rams had lower motility than unaffected rams (42.1 ± 6.7% vs 62.2 ± 4.1% and 47.8 ± 7.4% vs 70.1 ± 4.7%, respectively; P ≤ 0.02) but no differences were observed within 4-yr-old rams. Across ages, sperm from UV rams had a lower percentage of normal than unaffected rams (91.5 ± 1.1% vs 94.3 ± 0.74%; P = 0.03). Sperm concentration, progressive motility, and SC were unaffected by UV status. Future studies will evaluate the effect UV status on siring capacity. Ultrasound methodologies previously refined to diagnose varicocele in boars helped identify sub-fertile rams that would not have been classified by routine BSE procedures. However, these methodologies would benefit from concurrent machine learning and software development to ensure imaging consistency across technicians and streamline procedures for real-time decision making.

47663f81e71ec289ae4512b08da0cf7c7dafa413,"ChatGPT, AI Advertising, and Advertising Research and Education","Since ChatGPT was released on November 30, 2022, followed by Microsoft’s announcement of its artificial intelligence (AI)–powered new Bing search engine on February 7, 2023, and Google’s Bard release on March 21, 2023, it seems AI generally has taken over conversations across all sectors of society. In a very short time span, consumers and a wide range of organizations have adopted generative AI technologies with astonishing capabilities (Bove 2023). These new technological developments have accelerated the integration of AI into many tools, apps, and areas of our daily life, but the transformative AI technology is perhaps most deeply impacting the world of advertising. AI-enabled advertising spending worldwide in 2022 was estimated to be $370 billion, with predictions of $1.3 trillion in the next ten years (Statista 2023). While the viral sensation and enormous popularity of ChatGPT are generating unprecedented attention and interest in AI right now, AI, as both a theoretical concept and version of its technological implementations and applications, has a long history with its origin going back to the 1950s. In the advertising field, the first research article on the topic of AI in connection to advertising was published in 1988 (Cook and Schleede 1988). The authors described “decision support systems” (i.e., expert systems) as probably the “most widely implemented and well-known applications of AI” (48). As described, these systems used databases and models to solve problems, such as help with direct-mail systems and newspaper advertising placement. Since then, AI has changed the business of media and advertising and attracted attention from both advertising practitioners and scholars. Although there is no standard definition, Rodgers (2021) defined AI advertising as “brand communication that uses a range of machine functions that learn to carry out tasks with intent to persuade with input by humans, machines, or both” (2) and positioned AI advertising as a subdiscipline of advertising “situated at the intersection of cognitive science, computer science, and advertising” (2). Advertisers are using AI technologies in automated market segmentation and targeting, ad creative development and personalization, improving ad buying and placement, and optimizing advertising investment (Kietzmann, Paschen, and Treen 2018). Following the trend of increasing AI adoption in advertising, advertising scholars have organized sessions at the American Academy of Advertising (AAA) conference, such as the 2014 preconference, “Big Data for Advertising Research and Education,” and the joint AAA-ANA Educational Foundation luncheon panel with the provocative title, “The Future of Advertising—Will We Be Replaced by Robots?” in 2018. The Journal of Advertising (JA) has published multiple themed collections on AI-related topics, starting with a Special Section on Artificial Intelligence and Advertising, guest-edited by Hairong Li (2019). This collection of articles explored the potential and actual application of AI technologies to enhance advertising efficiency, effects, and effectiveness across the entire spectrum of the advertising campaign process, from situation analysis and consumer insight generation to advertising message creation, to media planning and buying, and to advertising effect assessment (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 48, no. 4). Another Special Section on Advances in Computational Advertising in 2020, guest edited by Jisu Huh and Ed Malthouse (2020), addressed broad implications of evolving computer science technologies for data-driven, AI-powered computational advertising, and proposed a future research agenda in the areas of macro and exogenous factors, consumers’ roles in computational advertising, AI-powered ad content generation, computational advertising media planning strategy shifts from purchasing exposure to focusing on meaningful consumer engagement, and computational advertising measurement systems (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 49, no. 4). A year later, JA published an up-to-date comprehensive Themed Issue on Promises and Perils of Artificial Intelligence and Advertising (2021, vol. 50, no. 1). In her editorial, the previous editor, Shelly Rodgers (2021) proposed an AI classification schema to systematically understand and develop subdomains",Journal of Advertising,2023.0,45,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00913367.2023.2227013?needAccess=true&role=button', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/00913367.2023.2227013?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2023.2227013, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Findings from the Yearbook 2023 Section on Education and Consumer Health Informatics,"Summary Objective : To summarise the state of the art during the year 2022 in consumer health informatics and education, with a special emphasis on “One Health”. Methods : We conducted a systematic search of articles published in PubMed. We build queries to merge terms related to “consumer health informatics”, “one health”, and “digital”. We retrieved 94 potential articles for review. These articles were screened according to topic relevance and 12 were selected for consideration of best paper candidates, which were then presented to a panel of international experts for full paper review and scoring. The top five papers were discussed in a consensus meeting. Three papers received the highest score from the expert panel, and these papers were selected to be representative papers on consumer informatics for exploring one health from consumer perspective in the year 2022. Results : Bibliometrics analysis conducted on words found in abstracts of the 12 candidate papers revealed four clusters of articles, where clustering outcomes explained 96.91% of the dispersion. The first cluster composes three papers related to patient engagement in primary care practices, using digital-delivered diabetes prevention programmes, or exploring citizen involvement in co-designing environmental projects (such as air pollution exposure and health). The second cluster represents four papers related to digital health literacy and consumer behavior, such as digital vaccine literacy, and food labelling influences and whether displaying Nutri- and Eco-Score at food product level led to improved consumer choices. The third cluster consists of two papers exploring strategies to involve citizens in various science projects while analyzing the quality of citizen-collected data (e.g., mosquito bites or gastropod community dataset). The last cluster contains three papers related to the relationships between human behavior with their environment and their contribution to citizen science projects (e.g., biological water quality in the Netherlands distribution, composition, abundance of debris across sandy beaches in Australia and its regions, urbanization and reptile biodiversity across Florida). Conclusion : Traditionally, consumer health informatics focuses on providing individuals with tools and resources to actively manage their own health. By incorporating a global health (or one health) perspective, our field is now at a crossroad, demanding us to think beyond the individual and challenging us to instill the thinking that our actions not only have consequences on the individual but also on the population and the environment. Perhaps this is also a reflective time for the consumer informatics field, to consider shifting the focus from the individual to one that is more aligned with one health, helping consumers gain awareness of how their actions impact on the individual, the population and the environment, and providing them with tools to work collectively to help decide how their actions may bring benefits (as well as harms) across these levels.",Yearbook of Medical Informatics,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'http://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0043-1768749.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10751142, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

52b6dd0506d0c6db232376d24f8be83ba53eb02c,First molecular detection of Babesia vulpes and Babesia capreoli in wild boars from southern Italy,"Introduction Following the increase of wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations in Europe, a potential risk of emerging infections by vector-borne pathogens may occur. Despite this, the circulation of piroplasmid species in these ungulates is still a neglected topic, particularly in the Mediterranean basin. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the presence of Babesia/Theileria spp. in wild boars from southern Italy to assess the epidemiological role of these ungulates in the circulation of piroplasmids. Methods By using a citizen science approach among hunters and veterinarians, wild boar spleen samples were collected in the Campania region (southern Italy) between 2016 and 2022. A combined semi-nested PCR/sequencing analysis targeting the V4 hyper-variable region of 18S rRNA was run to detect Babesia/Theileria spp. DNA. Results Out of 243 boars, 15 (i.e., 6.2, 95% CI: 3.4–9.9) tested positive to Babesia/Theileria spp., Babesia vulpes (n = 13, 5.3, 95% CI: 3.1–8.9) the most prevalent, followed by Babesia capreoli (n = 2, 0.8, 95% CI: 0.2–2.9). Three different B. vulpes sequence types were identified (i.e., ST1, ST2, ST3), with the most representative as ST1 (60%), and a single B. capreoli sequence type. No statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) were found between the presence of the pathogens and boar age, sex, province and sample collection year. Discussion Data demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of B. vulpes and B. capreoli in wild boars, which may play a role in the biological cycle of piroplasmids. We emphasize the importance of monitoring these ungulates to prevent potential foci of infection. The engagement of hunters in epidemiological scientifically based surveys can constitute a technically sound control strategy of piroplasmids in a One Health perspective.",Frontiers in Veterinary Science,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2023.1201476/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10442169, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 Dr. George W. Kattawar is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Physics & Astronomy and the Institute of Quantum Science & Engineering at Texas A&M University. He is an internationally renowned expert in radiative transfer and light scattering dealing with full Mueller matrix/Stokes vector processes. He has made significant contributions in using radiative transfer in such diverse areas as biomedical optics, planetary atmospheres, cloud and aerosol property studies related to climate studies, invisibility cloaking, ultrashort laser propagation in water, and anthrax detection. To list just a few among his seminal contributions, he was the first to show that the clouds of Venus were not water, which was the view held by two eminent scientists Carl Sagan and Richard Goody. It was this seminal work which led to the ultimate determination of the Venus cloud composition. He is one of the first researchers to apply Monte Carlo techniques to radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres. This technique is now being used by researchers all over the world and is also now being used in medical physics. He gave the first correct explanation of the “Ring effect” which had remained an enigma for over twenty years. This paper was designated by a world-renowned scientist at NASA to be the best paper of the decade in atmospheric science. Dr. Kattawar and his collaborators developed one of the most powerful time dependent, three-dimensional Monte Carlo codes capable of handling full Mueller matrix solutions for a coupled atmosphere-ocean system with a fully stochastic interface. This code will become the “Gold Standard” for all future researchers in biomedical, atmospheric, and oceanic optics. He is one of the first to show that nonspherical objects can be made totally invisible if the optical properties are selected in the right way. Dr. Kattawar received many awards and recognitions, including Fellow of the Optical Society of America (1976); Amoco Foundation Teaching Excellence Award (1981); Teacher/Scholar Award (1990), Nils Gunnar Jerlov Award (2014), and van de Hulst Light Scattering Award (2015); He was also elected for two, three-year terms on the Committee on Recommendations for U.S. Army Basic Scientific Research under the National Research Council.

ad8bee280a4fea33f5db6037f5e6aed8069033ee,A bibliometric and visualization analysis of the aerosol research on the Himalayan glaciers,"This research focuses on a bibliometric analysis of research on aerosols’ impact on the glaciers in the Himalayan glacier region published in journals from all subject categories based on the Science Citation Index Expanded, collected from the Web of Science and Scopus database between January 2002 and April 2022. The indexing phrases like “aerosol,” “glacier,” and “snow” are commonly used terms and have been utilized to collect the related publications for this investigation. The document selections were based on years of publication, authorship, the scientific output of authors, distribution of publication by country, categories of the subjects, and names of journals in which scholarly papers were published. The number of articles on aerosols accelerating the melting of glaciers shows a notable increase in recent years, along with more glacier melting results from countries involved in climate science research. People’s Republic of China (382) was the country with the highest publication output on aerosols impacting the melting of glaciers. The USA (367) was the most cited country, with about 17,500 total citations and 80.40 average citations per year from January 2002 to April 2022. The results reveal that research trends in the glaciers on aerosols’ impact on the glaciers have been attractive in recent years, and the number of articles in this field keeps increasing fast.

To evaluate the economic performance of propyrisulfuron, a field study was conducted in 2021 and 2022 on a farm of the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China. Eight different herbicide treatments were employed, including CB (cyhalofop butyl), Py (propyrisulfuron), CBPy (cyhalofop butyl plus propyrisulfuron), PrBe 3, PrBe 10, and PrBe 3+PrBe 10 (pretilachlor plus bensulfuron applied at different times [at 3 (PrBe 3) and 10 (PrBe 10) d] or sequentially, respectively), 2PrBe+PeCBBz (pretilachlor plus bensulfuron [applied sequentially] followed by penoxsulam plus cyhalofop butyl plus bentazone), 2PrBe+MeCBBz (pretilachlor plus bensulfuron [applied sequentially] followed by metamifop plus cyhalofop butyl plus bentazone), along with weed-free and nontreated weedy check treatments. Herbicide treatments did not cause visual phytotoxicity to rice, and bending and leaf rolling were not observed. Only the two propyrisulfuron treatments had temporary negative effects on rice height, but rice recovered quickly. Compared with the weed-free treatment, CBPy did not affect rice tiller number or dry matter accumulation. Compared with the nontreated weedy check, herbicide treatments reduced total weed density by 29.4% to 99.1% and dry biomass by 32.2% to 98.7%. The CBPy treatment provided the best weed control, reducing weed density and biomass by 96.7% and 95.9% in 2021 and 97.4% and 95.6% in 2022, respectively. Rice grain yield was not significantly different between CBPy and the weed-free treatment in either year. Economic analysis showed that CBPy provided the highest net profit, followed by that in 2PrBe+PeCBBz and 2PrBe+MeCBBz, with the lowest net profit in the nontreated weedy check. Thus, CBPy provides good weed control and could be promoted in mechanically transplanted rice fields in China.",Frontiers in Plant Science,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1281931/pdf?isPublishedV2=False', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10619164, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a5f63b8de92333a8f9931ee60334e775bf79e751,Visualization Analysis of Research Hotspots and Trends in the Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy with Traditional Chinese Medicine,": This paper aims to make a systematic visualization analysis on literature relating to the treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and explore the research hotspots and frontier trends in this field, thus providing references for future research. All literature relating to this field, which were published between the time when the databases were released and August 29th 2022, was retrieved from databases such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database(VIP), Wanfang Database and Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC).Citespace software was used for visualization analyses on co-occurrence, clustering and citation burst of the keywords of papers published, and the category, authors, institutions, keywords of the papers as well as the research hotspots in the field. A total of 507 Chinese articles and 765 English papers in this field were obtained. Through analysis, it was found that there were 24 core authors in Chinese articles and only one in English articles. Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine each published 12 Chinese papers in the field, the most Chinese papers that an institution had ever published, while Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences published 22 English papers, the most English papers an institution had ever published. The co-occurrence analyses for keywords showed that 362 keywords were captured from Chinese articles, which included ""traditional Chinese medicine"" ""review"" and ""deficiency of both Qi and Yin"", etc. And a total of 583 keywords were captured from English articles, which focused on ""oxidative stress"" ""medicinal plant"" and ""cell"", etc. By clustering the keywords, seven clustering labels were formed using keywords identified from Chinese articles, including ""#0 diabetic retinopathy"" ""#1 traditional Chinese medicine"" and ""#2 laser photocoagulation"". And nine clustering tags were formed using keywords from English articles, including ""# 0 diabetes mellitus"", ""# 1 diabetes retina"" and ""# 2 antioxidant activity"". The citation burst analysis of keywords from Chinese papers showed that Chinese herbal drug was the keywords with the longest duration of research focus, and together with laser photocoagulation, constituted the topics in the earliest research of the field. While in English paper analysis, glycemic control was a topic with the longest research duration, and constituent was the subject in the earliest research of the field. Conclusions are as follows, the number of literature in the field of TCM treatment for DR has increased year on year. However, cooperation and interactions between researchers and research institutions didn’t look promising over the years, which apparently should be enhanced.

38dd699326deb6205a8f229b9c4246d15936eb0c,Zooming in on Open Access in Ukraine,"In October 2022, Ukraine declared its commitment to enhancing the effectiveness, quality and responsiveness of its research by implementing the National Plan for Open Science (Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, 2022). This document represents a significant step forward in aligning Ukraine's national legislation with European Union requirements and promoting the adoption of open science practices. Open access (OA) is a crucial component of open science, and it is imperative to gain insight into its growth to inform funding policies and plan infrastructure development accordingly.The aim of this research is to obtain a comprehensive overview of the OA development in Ukraine. To achieve this goal, publications affiliated with Ukrainian research institutions and universities in the period from 2012 to 2021 were collected from three well-known databases: Dimensions, Web of Science, and Scopus. Records were gathered in November 2022 using the web interfaces of WoS and Scopus, while data from Dimensions was extracted via the Dimensions API. After excluding duplicates and publications without DOIs, the OA status of each publication was determined using the Unpaywall API.
The study revealed that between 2012 and 2021, authors affiliated with Ukrainian research institutions and universities published 201,670 research papers. Of these publications, 66.7% were open access, while the remaining 33.3% were behind a paywall. The percentage of OA articles for the indicated 10-year period increased substantially from 33.8% in 2012 to 79.9% in 2021.Gold open access was the most common OA subtype, with 68.4% of articles published in OA journals. The second most frequent choice was bronze open access, accounting for 15.3% of articles. Green subtype and hybrid were less commonly used, with 8.5% and 7.8% of articles published in these categories, respectively.Regarding the distribution of open access across different academic disciplines, the highest percentage of OA publications was found in the social sciences, with a rate of 88.1%, followed closely by the humanities at 87.8%, and medical and health sciences at 73.4%. Agriculture sciences, multidisciplinary studies, and natural sciences also exhibited relatively high levels of OA publications, representing 71.7%, 63.4%, and 55.7%, respectively. The lowest proportion of OA publications was observed in the engineering and technology category, with a rate of 47.7%.This empirical study indicates that the share of OA publications in Ukraine is significantly higher than the global average of 31% reported by Piwowar, Priem, and Orr in 2019 and their estimation of 44% by 2025 (Piwowar et al., 2019). Notably, Ukraine is approaching the indicators of European ""openness"" leaders, such as Great Britain, Sweden, Austria, and the Netherlands (Robinson-Garcia et al., 2020). It is worth mentioning that northern and central European countries have been early adopters of open access policies (Maddi et al., 2021), while Ukraine lacks mandates for research dissemination through OA, transformative agreements and only a few institutions have registered their OA policy with ROARMAP. The high share of OA publications in Ukraine can be partially attributed to the longstanding tradition of national journals being open access and fully subsidized by hosting research institutions. Therefore, open access has always been a part of the research dissemination culture in Ukraine (Novikov, 2020).",PUBMET - Conference Scholarly Publishing Context Open Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://morepress.unizd.hr/journals/index.php/pubmet/article/download/4255/4987', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15291/pubmet.4255?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15291/pubmet.4255, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1d58e2620dcbe713b10a02b2735d36c292c13f49,Conversations with Gábor J. Székely,". Gábor J. Székely was born in Budapest, Hungary on February 4, 1947. He graduated from Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) with an M.S. degree in 1970, and a Ph.D. degree in 1971. He received his Candidate Degree from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1976, and the Doctor of Science Degree (D. Sc.) from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1986. Székely joined the Department of Probability Theory of ELTE in 1970. In 1989 he became the founding chair of the Department of Stochastics of the Budapest Institute of Technology (Technical University of Budapest). In 1995 he moved to the United States as a tenured full professor at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) in Bowling, Green, Ohio. Before that, in 1990-91, he was the first Lukacs Distinguished Professor at BGSU. Székely had several visiting positions, e.g., at the University of Amsterdam in 1976 and at Yale University in 1989. Between 2006 and 2022 he served as a Program Director in the Statistics Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences at the US National Science Foundation. Székely has about 250 publications, including 6 books in several lan-guages. In 1988 he received the Rollo Davidson Prize from Cambridge University, jointly with Imre Z. Ruzsa for their work on algebraic probability theory. In 2010 Székely became an Elected Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics mostly for his works dealing with physics concepts in statistics like energy statistics and distance correlation. Székely was an invited speaker at several Joint Statistical Meetings and also an organizer of invited sessions on energy statistics and distance correlation. Székely was an invited speaker at the centenary of Dortmund University in Germany and also at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey.

50f87aae9dff52d8c450326c6c880c9771366321,The God of Chance and Purpose: Divine Involvement in a Secular Evolutionary World,"THE GOD OF CHANCE AND PURPOSE: Divine Involvement in a Secular Evolutionary World by Bradford McCall. Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2022. 156 pages. Paperback; $24.00. ISBN: 9781725283831. *Bradford McCall is a young but prolific scholar, having completed his PhD in 2022 at the Claremont School of Theology, yet having published five books and about fifty articles. In this slim volume of six chapters, McCall proposes the elements of a complementary relationship between science, particularly evolutionary biology, and Christian faith. His proposal is rooted in a panentheistic theology of God that I will consider further below. On a first reading, I confess that I often lost the thread of McCall's argument amid his dense prose and fascinating tangents. On my rereading of the book, I distilled from the concluding chapter an outline of McCall's argument, so as to maintain a sense of direction throughout chapters 1-5. *The relation between science and theology is broadly considered in chapter 1, using the typology of Mikael Stenmark. McCall then proposes that science and theology overlap in terms of both social practice and subject matter. A metaphysical monist, he does not distinguish between mental and physical processes. This connects with the assertion (via Arthur Peacocke) that there is no ""causal joint"" to look for, either in solving the mind-body problem or in a theory of divine action. McCall is influenced by process philosophy and proposes panexperientialism--the idea that everything, from people to fundamental particles, has experience, a ""subjective interiority."" This is not to say that electrons think, nor does McCall tend toward anthropomorphism, but his is not the disenchanted universe of Jacques Monod. His theology of God is ""intermediate between the omnipotent God of classical theism and the absentee god of deism"" (p. 9). God, in this view, is ""persuasive, not coercive"" toward the creation. McCall views complex phenomena as emergent, invoking John Haught's notion of ""layered explanations"" that operate simultaneously without conflict. *The second chapter offers a consideration of evolutionary thought and the philosophy of biology--common ancestry, selectionism, adaptationism, and units of selection. Subtle controversies are investigated, such as the falsifiability of adaptationism, pluralism as an alternative, and the concept of spandrels introduced by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin. This was deep and informative reading. In some ways, it was my favorite chapter; yet it seems disconnected from the thread of McCall's overall argument. *McCall's third chapter is entitled ""The God of Chance,"" but oddly contains no discussion of God. Rather, he investigates how scientific thought has developed the idea of chance. As a twenty-first-century scientist, I take statistical reasoning for granted. It had never occurred to me that biologists in Darwin's time would lack this category of reasoning. Let me digress for a moment to make a connection with physics, since that is my own area. The theory of statistical mechanics developed rapidly between 1857 and 1905. In 1859, the same year Darwin published On the Origin of Species, James Clerk Maxwell presented a paper in which he described the random motions of gas molecules with the distribution that now bears his name. This history is well summarized in a 1997 paper by Dieter Flamm.1 It should therefore not have surprised me to learn from McCall that, in Darwin's time, statistical thinking had as yet gained no purchase in the biological sciences. *Darwin introduced chance as shorthand for undirected variation within a species, the raw material upon which selection acts. He used the word ""chance"" 67 times in On the Origin of Species. Darwin's writing reflects an inner struggle over how to conceptualize random phenomena. Like the pre-quantum physicists, Darwin did not think of chance as a cause in itself; rather, it reflected the ignorance of a human observer attempting to describe a dauntingly complex natural world, with too many moving parts to track--be they molecules or finches. Nevertheless, in many places Darwin appears to ascribe causal power to chance. This is an apparent break with the thinking of his contemporaries. By the time Gould and Niles Eldredge articulated the theory of punctuated equilibria, random processes were commonplace in all the sciences. *Relying heavily on Grant Ramsey and Charles Pence,2 McCall summarizes the development of thought about chance, contingency, probability, and the variability (or fixity) of species. Working from Democritus to Aristotle and up to Darwin's time, he sketches the context in which Darwin's ideas took shape. Darwin's innovation was to show how selection bridges from what seems purposeless (chance variation) to what seems purposeful (adaptation). In this regard, Darwin's writing over time increasingly appropriated the language of purpose. Nonetheless, Darwin adopted the agnosticism of Huxley, and he resisted the attempts of Asa Gray to pull him toward natural theology. *From Darwin, McCall traces the outlines of the modern synthesis in the first half of the twentieth century and thence to Gould. Contingency, operating at a host of levels from large environments to small populations and microscopic mutations, has played a growing role to the present day. McCall raises the question of whether chance is ""fundamental and irreducible,"" but he addresses this question more through the lens of twentieth-century philosophy than twentieth-century science, quoting, for example, Bertrand Russell's 1913 essay ""On the Notion of Cause."" To me, this was a surprising choice. Critiques of the sort raised by Russell and others have exerted little influence on scientific discourse, as a search for recent mentions of causal(ity) in contemporary journals will show. McCall seemingly returns to a more typical picture of causation in chapter 5 (e.g., in the conclusion of his discussion of teleology on p. 113). *In chapter 4, McCall invokes Philip Clayton and Jürgen Moltmann to set forth a scientifically informed theology of God. The journey begins with the question of how God relates to the universe. McCall adopts panentheism, in which the universe is within God, but God is more than the universe. God's role as creator argues for the universality of what scripture teaches. The monist approach of panentheism entails that God works in and through the creation. On this view, natural law is divine action by which the universe is sustained. Yet McCall acknowledges the need for a theory of divine action, at least to account for miracles. Some have proposed that randomness (quantum or classical) leaves room for a ""bottom up"" style of divine influence in the world. McCall eschews any such ""causal joint,"" preferring to ""leave the notion of divine involvement in the world ambiguous, nebulous, and indefinite."" He prefers ""top-down causation,"" à la Arthur Peacocke and Jaegwon Kim. I longed for a deeper dive into why McCall rejects divine omnipotence and why he posits that God works exclusively through secondary causes. I perceive unresolved tension between these assertions and McCall's acknowledgment of miracles and his expressed eschatalogical expectation of re-creation. *This chapter may aim at an audience already immersed in Philip Clayton's work, which I am not. I found myself repeatedly puzzled. For example, quoting Clayton, arguing for panentheism: ""The infinite may without contradiction include within itself things that are by nature finite, but it may not stand outside of the finite"" (p. 99). A counterexample sprang immediately to mind: the (infinite) set of rational numbers is outside the finite set {π, e}. Perhaps infinite is here understood to mean entirely comprehensive, containing everything; but on that interpretation, Clayton's words would be a definition of panentheism rather than an argument for it. *Traditionally, Christian theology has employed a dualist metaphysics in which God is distinct from creation. Faced with McCall's adoption of a monist panentheism, one might wonder how created beings who are part of God have freedom or moral agency. Do scriptural themes such as sin or judgment belong in a universe that is conceived as a strict subset of God's being? McCall does not address such potential inconsistencies. The answers may depend on what McCall (via Clayton and Moltmann) actually means by panentheism, a category that has perhaps expanded beyond its original definition. See, for example, Roger Olson's perceptive essay on panentheism and relational theology.3 *McCall turns to natural theology in chapter 5. Following Alister McGrath, the task of natural theology is to read nature from a Christian theological perspective. Natural theology should engage in constructive ""sense-making,"" not to convince the unbeliever, but to perceive the divine within and behind nature. McCall articulates but peremptorily dismisses Aquinas's teleological argument for the existence of God from regularities in nature. This form of natural theology and its modern analogues McCall abruptly denigrates as ""notoriously ambiguous, conceptually fluid, and imprecise"" (p. 105). This illustrates a shortcoming of the book: McCall revels in intellectual history, but his assessment of the ideas is frequently unclear or incomplete. *There follows a detailed summary of McGrath's The Open Secret, but this summary makes too little contact with McCall's argument. Better is his engagement with Darwinism and the Divine, which leads into a critique of Paley's natural theology and a contrast with T. H. Huxley. Often quoted as a categorical denier of purpose in evolution, Huxley saw incontrovertible teleology in some ""primordial molecular arrangement""--an initial condition from which the present state of the world would inexorably develop. McCall likens this to Ernst Mayr's observation that ""the occurrence of goal-directed processes is perhaps the most characteristic fea",Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.56315/pscf9-23mccall?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.56315/pscf9-23mccall, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a174d531567d17c6ec802abe00f9b64e7fda464f,"Experimenting with Humans and Animals: from Aristotle to Crispr, second edition","EXPERIMENTING WITH HUMANS AND ANIMALS: From Aristotle to CRISPR, second edition by Anita Guerrini. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2022. viii + 208 pages. Paperback; $28.95. ISBN: 9781421444055. *There has been a haunting thought ever since I began to use live mammals for my research in neurophysiology: ""Will my descendants accuse me of cruelty towards animals as much as we do to the scientists under the Nazis?"" A number of neurophysiologists have been threatened and attacked to stop their research, and, as a consequence, there are few neurophysiologists left using rhesus monkeys along the West coastline of the US and Canada. Research with rats is increasingly of concern to some, and mice might be the next subject of attention. Research staff and students, who are required to remain on budget with their projects, are put under increasing pressure and stress in order to take better care of their laboratory animals without receiving compensation or support. In the meantime, almost nobody seems to care to know how many animals were sacrificed to develop the celebrated COVID-19 vaccines. Are we, biomedical researchers, ever going to have a resolution to this ethical tension around us? Are we going to be viewed by future historians as the heroes of science--or as abusers of living creatures? *Anita Guerrini's Experimenting with Humans and Animals: From Aristotle to CRISPR does not answer the question. As the author states in the beginning of her book, her objective is to tell the history of ""trial and error, prejudice and leaps of faith, clashing egos and budget battles,"" to help us evaluate ""the value, and the values, of Western science,"" and to ""influence the future."" In other words, the purpose of the book is not to make ethical arguments or to appraise a certain aspect of historical development, such as the progress of ethical care for human and animal subjects. It is, rather, to reveal the reality that ethical views and sentiments have changed, collided, merged, and contradicted each other across time and political landscapes. *This text poses questions, implicitly and explicitly, to enable us to address some of the issues and challenges we are facing at present. A first question arises from the history of vivisection (chap. 1). Vivisection refers to experimenting with (mostly dissecting) live animals, and sometimes even humans. This appears for the first time in recorded history back in ancient Greece, meaning it was practiced for two millennia without anesthesia, a discovery not made until the eighteenth century. More strikingly, vivisection was done as part of ""edutainment"" shows in ancient times. Criticism of the practice was not necessarily about the cruelty but rather about the usefulness of the knowledge obtained from dying or dead animals. The rights or well-being of animals were not much of an issue in the ancient age as human dominion was a firmly held belief. Such an ethical view continued to be dominant until early Modernity (seventeenth-century Europe) when human and animal bodies alike were viewed as machines, and animal experimentation began to be accepted as a cardinal method for biomedical sciences (chap. 2). At that time, ethical concerns on the use of animals did arise, but the concern lay rather in the human virtues of kindness and compassion rather than the rights of animals. *Eighteenth-century Europe slipped into a new stage of biomedical science after Queen Mary II of England died of smallpox, from which experimentation with humans becomes central (chap. 3). Inoculation, adopted from the Eastern world with initial suspicions, was slowly gaining credibility through parents who were unwilling to put their children at the risk of falling ill to smallpox. The validation of its effectiveness eventually came about upon testing with the socially marginalized, including prisoners, orphans, patients, and slaves. Yet criticisms around the ""science"" of inoculation were not made for using the marginalized as test subjects but rather for superseding God's authority to cause one to be ill or healed. While an increasing number of animal experiments were conducted routinely, and mathematical descriptions of the body became of greater interest to scientists, the emerging utilitarian ethics began to awaken Europeans, especially the British, to the suffering of animals. While elevated sensitivity to animal suffering led to ""antivivisection"" movements in England, experimental medicine and physiology were established as scientific fields. During this period nation-states also began to be involved in science. This was also the time when anesthesia was discovered, and pain perception became an important topic in physiology. Eventually, common beliefs about racial or sexual differences in pain perception were also tested, by experimenting with women and black slaves. *In the late nineteenth century, animal experimentation made a strong comeback as the germ theory of disease was solidly validated by scientists such as Pasteur, Koch, and Ehrlich (chap. 5). As scientists began to conquer many diseases such as anthrax, rabies, syphilis, and tuberculosis, the victory of science quenched the antivivisectionist movement. A number of animals, including rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, and monkeys, were used to test theories, vaccines, and drugs during this period. At the same time, human experimentation begins to be regulated by states, but the regulation was so elementary that practices were allowed that would not be tolerated in our time. Concerns with animal experimentation reemerged in the twentieth century when polio research, strongly advocated by Franklin Roosevelt, a victim of polio himself, claimed a striking number of rhesus monkey lives (chap. 6). As an example, in the 1950s, the United States imported from India 200,000 rhesus monkeys per year for polio research. Despite the polio vaccine's success, primate research appalled the public, especially when behavioral research on primates revealed the emotional depth and social intelligence of these animals. Animals came to be seen no longer just as machines, but as our cousins who, like us, have consciousness. *The last chapter begins by depicting the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal of 1946, which led to the first written set of guidelines for human experimentation. Up until this time, there had been little consensus or regulation in using humans for experiments, let alone with the requirement that they must be mentally competent, uncoerced, and fully aware of possible consequences. It is hence not surprising that scientists under the Nazis defended themselves against charges of abuse and euthanasia of human subjects by paralleling their conduct with the practices of contemporary American scientists. American practice was exemplified by the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male, conducted from the 1930s to the 1970s, in which the United States Public Health Service left four hundred black syphilis-infected males untreated, without telling them that their treatment had been stopped, in order to study the natural development of untreated syphilis. More than one hundred died as a result. Inconsistency in research ethics can also be found in the case of Japanese scientists, who, in contrast to Germans, were pardoned for their research conduct during World War II in return for providing information to the United States. Nonetheless, through the twentieth century until today, the level of public awareness and national regulations on the use of animal and human subjects has been progressively elevated. Yet, accelerated advances in research technology, including the latest breakthrough of gene editing, and expansion of research fields, continue to add complexity to ethical discourses. *I was impressed by Guerrini's vast knowledge of the historical development of biomedical science, including the events that matter to ethical issues around use of animal and human subjects in research. At the same time, she manages to make the book concise. While the book concerns the ethics of animal and human experimentation, it is certainly not an ethics or philosophy book but rather a story book. That is, while the book raises ethical questions in an unbiased manner, the chronological organization of this story does not conveniently lend itself to efforts to systematically examine or establish ethical principles on these matters. Nonetheless, a deeper understanding of the historical background to the different perspectives encountered in these stories enables one to make more-informed assessments of present-day perspectives. The book can be particularly helpful for those who do not have a biomedical background but wish to engage in contemporary ethical discourses, as well as for those who have rarely thought about the issues at all, often under the assumption that science has justly treated human or animal subjects. Finally, reading these accounts from ancient to contemporary times will certainly help one realize that what is the norm today was not necessarily the norm in the past, nor will it be in the future. Therefore, scientists like me need to humbly accept that we will someday be judged; I believe this knowledge will help us use our best conscience in the present. *Reviewed by Kuwook Cha, Postdoctoral researcher in Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 0G4.",Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith,2023.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.56315/pscf9-23guerrini?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.56315/pscf9-23guerrini, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Over the last 50 years, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) research has grown exponentially from 0 to more than 17,000 papers published annually. We provide an overview of generic HRQoL measures used widely in epidemiological studies, health services research, population studies, and randomized clinical trials [e.g., Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®)-29]. In addition, we review methods used for economic analysis and calculation of the quality-adjusted life year (QALY). These include the EQ-5D, the Health Utilities Index (HUI), the self-administered Quality of Well-being Scale (QWB-SA), and the Health and Activities Limitation Index (HALex). Furthermore, we consider hybrid measures such as the SF-6D and the PROMIS-Preference (PROPr). The plethora of HRQoL measures has impeded cumulative science because incomparable measures have been used in different studies. Linking among different measures and consensus on standard HRQoL measurement should now be prioritized. In addition, enabling widespread access to common measures is necessary to accelerate future progress.

ISBN: 9781514001004. *Finally! The long-awaited update to Responsible Technology: A Christian Perspective (Stephen V. Monsma, ed., Eerdmans, 1986) is here, and this new book is well worth the wait. Framed as a practical field guide for engineers, it is also adept at illuminating some of the philosophical issues that swirl around the interface of technology and Christian faith. Hearty pats-on-the-back to Ethan Brue, Derek Schuurman, and Steven VanderLeest for undertaking and completing this grand project in such fine fashion. *It begins with an inspiring discussion of the connections between humankind's technological hopes and dreams and our ultimate hope in our Maker. Historical accounts and personal stories by each author will surely be an encouragement to young people who are curious about technology from a Christian perspective. Indeed, this book would make a good text for a university-level ""Introduction to Engineering"" course. The book continues with an insightful survey of how technology relates to the biblical story. This includes a discussion of humanity's first great commission to steward the earth, as well as the influence of fall, redemption, and re-creation on our engineering enterprises. *It gets even more interesting (and philosophical) as the authors next address the popular false narrative that all technology is inherently neutral. Several examples help to expose myths about the universal usefulness and neutrality of tools, the ends justifying the means, and forms of technological determinism. This is followed by a discussion of what constitutes responsible and discerning design, including technological mediation and unintended consequences. This naturally leads into the real ""meat"" of the book, which deals with design norms, or guiding principles that designers should seek to follow. *The authors extend the original list of norms in Responsible Technology to include categories of analytical, cultural, clarity, social, stewardship, harmony, justice, caring, and faithfulness. Common ethical frameworks are then presented that build on these design norms. This is excellent background knowledge that will greatly benefit engineering students, as well as practitioners. Although a Christian worldview pervades the entire book, it is explicitly addressed in ""Modern Towers of Babel"" (chapter 6) which explores the results of sin on engineering and resulting technologies. A helpful distinction between finiteness and fallenness illuminates this discussion. *The engineering of electric vehicles provides a fascinating example of how important historical context and past industry contribute to understanding in current designs. With this background, the design norms are then applied to envision the responsible development of a future electric vehicle. A chapter on technology and the future follows, with discussions of technological optimism, pessimism, and transhumanism. A biblical view of the future of technology concludes this section by framing it all in a Christian perspective. I imagine this section will be exciting for young engineers as they envision how God is calling them to use future technologies to influence the world for good and not for ill.. *However, I found the second-to-last chapter (on technology for evangelism and missions) to be the most interesting. Here we are reminded that technological work is a legitimate Christian calling, since ""Our worship does not start and stop with the formal service in a church building … worship can and should be an ever-present mindset and continuous act"" (p. 175). And training as a technologist not only enables one to use technology in serving others physically, but it also provides access to the technological community where one can have an even more profound influence. The authors emphasize that ""While Christians from a wide variety of vocational backgrounds can serve as missionaries in developing countries, only those with a highly technical education can serve as missionaries to this corporate mission field. Technical expertise opens doors"" (p. 168). Readers are encouraged to develop their own unique and creative ways to use technology to love their neighbor. But this is about as close as the authors get to discussing what may be an important calling for many Christian engineers, that of the evangelist/apologist. I would like to have seen more discussion on how the expertise of engineers enables them to answer questions on science and faith apparent disagreements, questions asked by both skeptics and believers. Engineers are uniquely qualified to serve as mediators and peacemakers in the science and faith conversation, and unfortunately, perhaps due to size constraints, this aspect was not mentioned in the book. *Finally, I hope that readers make it to the last chapter since I found it particularly meaningful. It consists of a series of emails between a young engineer and his former engineering professor and mentor at a Christian university. Although the letters are fictional, they raise many questions that often arise within the first years of an engineering career. And the good professor dispenses his wisdom with keen insight and grace. Overall, I found this book to be a much-needed addition to the conversation on technology and Christian faith. And I think it should be widely considered as required reading in the first year of engineering programs at Christian universities. The questions for reflection and discussion at the end of each chapter are very thoughtful and provide a helpful resource in this regard. *Reviewed by Dominic Halsmer, Senior Professor of Engineering, Oral Roberts University, Tulsa, OK 74171.",Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.56315/pscf3-23brue?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.56315/pscf3-23brue, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c29a6064cf730fea85b9809beb942c701855be60,Improvements in swine herd biosecurity reduce the incidence risk of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in breeding herds in the Midwestern United States.,"OBJECTIVE
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a significant disease of swine. The purpose of this study was to determine whether application of a comprehensive, science-based approach to breeding herd biosecurity, known as next-generation biosecurity (NGB), could reduce PRRS incidence risk across a large commercial production company.


ANIMALS
Pigs (381,404 sows across 76 breeding herds).


METHODS
From 2009 to 2020, the annual incidence risk of PRRS in sow farms managed by the same company averaged 33%, ranging from 20% to 50%. To measure the effect of NGB on PRRS incidence risk, a retrospective cohort study was conducted from July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2023, across breeding herds managed by the same company. During the analysis, 2 groups of herds emerged: those that implemented protocols for all phases of NGB (NGB COMPLETE), and those that implemented all described protocols of biosecurity except for air filtration (NGB INCOMPLETE).


RESULTS
During the 2-year assessment period, 56 breeding herds were classified as NGB COMPLETE, while 20 herds were NGB INCOMPLETE. The PRRS incidence risk in NGB COMPLETE herds was 8.9% as compared to 40.0% in NGB INCOMPLETE herds. From disease year 1 (July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022) and disease year 2 (July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023), system-wide PRRS incidence risk was 8.6% and 9.2%, respectively. The association between NGB status and PRRS incidence risk for the 2-year period was statistically significant at a P value of .006.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Results of the present report provided evidence that improvements in biosecurity result in lower PRRS incidence risk under large-scale commercial swine production conditions.",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,2023.0,5,"{'url': 'https://avmajournals.avma.org/downloadpdf/journals/javma/aop/javma.23.08.0437/javma.23.08.0437.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2460/javma.23.08.0437?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.23.08.0437, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Today the commercial market is very competitive and causes companies to see a deeper horizon and adopt certain methodologies and new processes such as digital transformation.According to the consulting firm Mckinzey, due to the pandemic, it has forced many entities to advance this adoption of new technologies, including the optimization of some manual processes, which have to be automated, but before talking about these technologies, we will verify some stumbling blocks that the digital transformation has that we detail below. according to (Weaver, 2021): 1) The approval of the directors: This is the biggest obstacle of the 3 points because most probably the directors in their planning have invested technological tools that due to pandemic issues, these became obsolete, but according to studies at the beginning of the year 2020 ( KPMG, 2020), “67% of executives in the United States expressed a great concern regarding the migration of all their businesses to the cloud, however, this quickly turned from being a concern to a necessity where as a result , 70% of managers have an affirmation that the new digital models had a great advance as a result of the pandemic”. 2) Resistance to change in human resources: this concept is not new in the market, because the lack of communication between the project leaders and the areas involved is not very effective, resulting in an environment of uncertainty and doubts about what that is being done. This exclusion of the staff and not making them part of our project, makes many people resist change, being a great obstacle for our technological project. It is always essential to be aware that the new technologies that are being implemented will most likely be used by these users, but it should also be considered that our users are used to executing and carrying out processes that are well known and it is the change in their routine that generates some fear or discomfort. 3) Reduce dependence on traditional tools: for some authors, this point is the continuity of the previous one, since users know how to use the computer tools they have used for years and a new update means for them to start over from scratch. Migrating to new technological tools must mean that for the company it will bring many benefits, as well as improve the quality of life of its users. Contrary to the previous points, the benefits obtained in the digital transformation can be indicated according to (CMC, 2020):1) Faster response to changes.2) Improve the customer experience.3) Make better decisions.4) New business opportunities.5) Reduce risks.6) Increases the productivity of the company.7) It favors collaborative work.8) Promotes innovation.9) Advantage over the competition.10) Decentralization of work. The digital transformation combines three important aspects in its development, starting with an open culture, new technologies and constant processes. For the latter, they can be implemented in different ways, such as robotic process automation (RPA). For (ToBeIt, 2022), RPA ""is one of the keys to the transformation of companies since it is allowing the automation of superfluous and repetitive processes or tasks through specific rules"". With this definition, various types of services can be created that lead to 24-hour care without the need for human intervention, of course, that the objective of RPA is not to replace human resources but rather to be able to optimize tasks carried out by users, providing the opportunity for the user to carry out other activities where they involve some type of decision. The different RPA tools, some of them entail a certain degree of programming knowledge, but, however, there are others that are very friendly and/or are carried out through a natural language, making it possible for the same user to configure them and plan their execution, taking into account the following activities: 1) Security and access to the tool, through the management of credentials and the roles of each user.2) Compatibility with existing applications in the company.3) User interface, the application must be as friendly to new users as it is to experienced users. In order to implement an RPA tool, it is essential to evaluate the following aspects: 1) Identify those repetitive tasks that consume many hours of work.2) Design and parameterization of the optimized workflow.3) Planning the implementation of the RPA tool together with constant monitoring of its execution. The benefits of implementing an RPA are: 1) Realization and execution of tasks 24*7 without the need for human intervention.2) Greater efficiency between 50% and 90% of current processes.3) Time savings, since the robot is much faster than human action.4) Because it has no human intervention, it can be said that the RPA has a margin of error of 0%.5) An RPA can be implemented without the intervention of a company IT team. According to the magic square of Garther 2021 ""estimates that 85% of companies with revenues greater than 1,000 million dollars will have deployed RPA by the end of the year 2022, a percentage that at the end of 2018 was 60%"". Another very important fact is that a study by (Hidalgo, 2022) indicates that ""in 2021, the business volume linked to this technology has been approximately $2B and an exponential growth of the RPA market is expected until it reaches a volume of 13.4B$ in the year 2030”. This information tells us that many companies are investing in RPA due to the benefits that they imply. In a report generated in (flobotics-io, 2022) it indicates that ""the use of RPA in industries, 38% is insurance companies, 36% is retail and hospitality, 30% is energy companies and utilities, with the same percentage is in health care companies, 24% in banking and financial entities and finally with 22% in pharmaceutical industries and others”. The types of companies not mentioned, have a low percentage of participation, but little by little they are increasing to adapt to this type of technology. In a survey issued by Deloitte, 92% indicated that RPA met or exceeded their expectations while 90% indicated that they had improved quality/accuracy, 86% improved productivity, and 59% indicated that they had a reduction in cost. costs. Another important piece of information is that 78% of companies that have implemented RPA expect to significantly increase their investment in RPA over the next three years. There is another very important statistic where it finds that 63% of companies plan to engage with an RPA implementation partner, while 19% plan to use RPA vendors for support and 15% will handle RPA internally. Finally, I can conclude that the inclusion of RPA in the digital transformation is very important for the competitive advantages that a company can have, since with it they manage to optimize their resources and generate great business opportunities, without forgetting the new services that a company can provide to its customers to improve the experience and satisfaction of this.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER RESEARCH,2023.0,3,"{'url': 'https://ijmcr.in/index.php/ijmcr/article/download/517/434', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47191/ijmcr/v11i2.04?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47191/ijmcr/v11i2.04, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Efforts to develop alternative protein sources that are sustainable and can help alleviate global food shortage problems should be prioritized. Insects have been part of our diet for thousands of years and still are today, and market trends show a global increase in the number of food-grade insect producers. The global market for edible insects has been forecasted to reach US$8 billion by the year 2030. Insects are highly nutritious and have bioactive peptides with potential therapeutic effects. This review provides an overview of the consumption of insects from ancient to modern times, discusses the rationale for using insects as alternative protein sources, and presents a summary of the major insects consumed worldwide as well as a brief description of the traditional and novel technologies currently used to process insects and/or extract their nutritional components.

cc4c6c2a622b9582b7492d5ba86411f6f2400b78,Preface,"Intelligence emerging from interactions between the body and the environment at the material and morphological levels attracts the attention of many different research communities. Researchers with engineering, social sciences, computer sciences, biology, and materials science backgrounds all study and understand embodied intelligence from their own perspectives. Therefore, providing a common definition of ‘Embodied Intelligence’ remains challenging. Furthermore, the intricate connection between the body and mind remains an unresolved philosophical question. Exploring this relationship not only deepens our understanding of animals and humans but also serves as a crucial element in the development of embodied artificial intelligence. By unraveling this connection, we can pave the way for creating robots endowed with practical intelligence. The long-standing philosophical debates surrounding consciousness have gained utmost significance in the realm of AI-powered machines. This book presents a comprehensive selection of papers authored by renowned researchers who participated in the 2nd International Conference on Embodied Intelligence held on 23-25 March, 2022, and the Embodied Intelligence Workshop, held at the RoboSoft 2022 Conference. This collection features reviews and perspectives articles, as well as the original research. The collection aims to stimulate interdisciplinary discussions and presenting novel ideas on the topic of Embodied Intelligence. By exploring the latest concepts and future directions in this field, these papers offer fresh perspectives and help paving the way for breakthroughs in both understanding and practical implementation. The central focus of this year’s conference revolved around two key topics: the significance of modeling in the design of soft robots and the pivotal role of the brain in embodied agents. The design of soft robots can follow a modeling-based approach using formal models and optimization techniques, similar to traditional rigid robotics. However, accurately modeling the behavior of soft robots is challenging. An exploratory approach inspired by biological organisms involves an iterative process, drawing insights from their locomotion and other behaviors. The role of the brain and central nervous system in bio-inspired robotics is significant, with self-organization and embodied intelligence allowing problem-solving without extensive centralized control. Researchers emulate cognitive processes observed in animals to develop intelligent robots, requiring advances in computational models and algorithms. Finding a good balance between exploiting the physical body and relying on computational capabilities remains an open topic of discussion. The book consists of a wide range of topics surrounding Embodied Intelligence and is loosely structured in two parts. The first set of chapters discuss the principles and perspectives on Embodied Intelligence and the links to robotics and artificial life. In the second half of the book, there is discussion on the connection between humans and Embodied Intelligence and the surrounding philosophy, psychology and cognitive science which ground and situate the research. We express our sincere gratitude to all the participants of the Conference and Workshop participants, the authors, and the reviewers for their outstanding contributions to this volume.",IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/1292/1/011001/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1757-899X/1292/1/011001?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/1292/1/011001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Project Based Learning (PjBL) is a studentcentered learning method. Entrepreneurship is a science that emphasizes attitudes and creativity, where creativity is a skill needed in the digital era. The Merdeka entrepreneurship program is one of the independent learning programs in the Merdeka learning curriculum at the Merdeka campus as a certified independent entrepreneurship development program to prepare individuals who are competent in developing businesses. Learning is used with a project based learning model. This learning activity includes individual and team learning. The aim of the research is to determine the process of implementing the project based learning model in increasing students’ creativity and skills in making business products and the results of increasing students’ creativity and skills in making business products through the project based learning model in learning creative product entrepreneurship courses for the even semester of the 2022/2023 academic year. This research is classroom action research with a project based learning model. The research subjects were students in the 6th semester of the Public Sector Accounting study program, totaling 100 students. Implementation from April to August 2023, consisting of 3 cycles, with stages: “Observation, Planning-Action & Reflection”. Actions are carried out by researchers and collaborators who are tasked with observing and recording any existing developments. The data collection method used is observation. Data analysis was carried out by measuring the creativity and skills of the product results of several types of businesses, namely by presenting them in the form of tables and percentages. The research results show that initial observations show that many groups still lack creativity and skill. In implementing the project based learning (PJBL) method, students experience an increase in their creative thinking and skills after being given action. Increased creativity in making student business products in learning creative products and entrepreneurship in semester 6 2022/2023 amounted to 84.66%, and increased skills in making student business products amounted to 81,25%.

64ca0286e03b0a3eb9b23634fd1f3920bdc4d9f6,Mentorship of young researchers in resource-limited settings: experiences of the mentees from selected health sciences Universities in Tanzania,"Introduction Mentorship is an essential component of research capacity building for young researchers in the health sciences. The mentorship environment in resource-limited settings is gradually improving. This article describes mentees’ experiences in a mentorship program for junior academicians amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Tanzania. Methods This is a survey study that examined the experiences of mentees who participated in a mentorship program developed as part of the Transforming Health Education in Tanzania (THET) project. The THET project was funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) under a consortium of three partnering academic institutions in Tanzania and two collaborating US-based institutions. Senior faculty members of respective academic institutions were designated as mentors of junior faculty. Quarterly reports submitted by mentees for the first four years of the mentorship program from 2018 to 2022 were used as data sources. Results The mentorship program included a total of 12 mentees equally selected from each of the three health training institutions in Tanzania. The majority (7/12) of the mentees in the program were males. All mentees had a master’s degree, and the majorities (8/12) were members of Schools/Faculties of Medicine. Most mentors (9/10) were from Tanzania’s three partnering health training institutions. All mentors had an academic rank of senior lecturer or professor. Despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the regular weekly meetings between mentors and mentees were not affected. By the fourth year of the mentorship program, more than three-quarters of mentees had published research related to the mentorship program in a peer-reviewed journal, over half had enrolled in Ph.D. studies, and half had applied for and won competitive grant awards. Almost all mentees reported being satisfied with the mentorship program and their achievements. Conclusion The mentorship program enhanced the skills and experiences of the mentees as evidenced by the quality of their research outputs and their dissemination of research findings. The mentorship program encouraged mentees to further their education and enhanced other skills such as grant writing. These results support the initiation of similar mentorship programs in other institutions to expand their capacity in biomedical, social, and clinical research, especially in resource-limited settings, such as Sub-Saharan Africa.",BMC Medical Education,2023.0,7,"{'url': 'https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12909-023-04369-z', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10206589, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e8cca3dc1c432a6d7784b8e4c08aaf21f507e38e,Cost-effectiveness of screening for chronic kidney disease in the general adult population: a systematic review,"ABSTRACT Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem, with rising incidence and prevalence worldwide, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Early identification and treatment of CKD can slow its progression and prevent complications, but it is not clear whether CKD screening is cost-effective. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of CKD screening strategies in general adult populations worldwide, and to identify factors, settings and drivers of cost-effectiveness in CKD screening. Methods Studies examining the cost-effectiveness of CKD screening in the general adult population were identified by systematic literature search on electronic databases (MEDLINE OVID, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) for peer-reviewed publications, hand-searched reference lists and grey literature of relevant sites, focusing on the following themes: (i) CKD, (ii) screening and (iii) cost-effectiveness. Studies comprising health economic evaluations performed for CKD screening strategies, compared with no CKD screening or usual-care strategy in adult individuals, were included. Study characteristics, model assumptions and CKD screening strategies of selected studies were identified. The primary outcome of interest is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CKD screening, in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and life-year gained (LYG), expressed in 2022 US dollars equivalent. Results Twenty-one studies were identified, examining CKD screening in general and targeted populations. The cost-effectiveness of screening for CKD was found to vary widely across different studies, with ICERs ranging from $113 to $430 595, with a median of $26 662 per QALY and from $6516 to $38 372, with a median of $29 112 per LYG. Based on the pre-defined cost-effectiveness threshold of $50 000 per QALY, the majority of the studies found CKD screening to be cost-effective. CKD screening was especially cost-effective in those with diabetes ($113 to $42 359, with a median of $27 471 per QALY) and ethnic groups identified to be higher risk of CKD development or progression ($23 902 per QALY in African American adults and $21 285 per QALY in Canadian indigenous adults), as indicated by a lower ICER. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of CKD screening improved if it was performed in older adults, populations with higher CKD risk scores, or when setting a higher albuminuria detection threshold or increasing the interval between screening. In contrast, CKD screening was not cost-effective in populations without diabetes and hypertension (ICERs range from $117 769 to $1792 142, with a median of $202 761 per QALY). Treatment effectiveness, prevalence of CKD, cost of CKD treatment and discount rate were identified to be the most common influential drivers of the ICERs. Conclusions Screening for CKD is especially cost-effective in patients with diabetes and high-risk ethnic groups, but not in populations without diabetes and hypertension. Increasing the age of screening, screening interval or albuminuria detection threshold, or selection of population based on CKD risk scores, may increase cost-effectiveness of CKD screening, while treatment effectiveness, prevalence of CKD, cost of CKD treatment and discount rate were influential drivers of the cost-effectiveness.",Clinical Kidney Journal,2023.0,23,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/ckj/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/ckj/sfad137/50576921/sfad137.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10765095, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The importance of the translation process should not be ignored because it always involves the translation texts from one language into another. English and Arabic share some similarities and differences, so we must keep this in mind. Many linguistic problems arise during the translation process. Accordingly, this study aims to identify the grammatical problems that EFL learners face when translating from Arabic into English as a target language; design and implement a test to find out such grammatical problems that fourth year students face when translating from Arabic into English; and provide solutions for these problems that Iraqi EFL learners encounter in Arabic-English translation. This study hypothesizes that the interference of the mother tongue and literal translation lead to incorrect translation; the most frequent problems in Arabic-English translation are those related to tenses, nominal vs verbal sentences, and word order; and problems that learners do not suffer from in Arabic-English translation are adjectives and negation. The test is taken by the morning and evening participants at the Dept. of English, College of Education for Humanities, University of Thi-Qar, 100 students (morning and evening) take the test throughout the academic year (2022-2023). The test consists of 20 Arabic items and the students are required to translate them into English. The research concludes that the greatest problematic areas for both morning and evening participants are: the past participle, the conditional sentences, the nominal vs. Verbal sentences, the word classes, and the tenses.",World Journal of English Language,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.sciedupress.com/journal/index.php/wjel/article/download/24220/15042', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5430/wjel.v13n7p263?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5430/wjel.v13n7p263, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e278948f276a6536c2086dbf729732ea4000bb8c,Rationing Medicine Through Bureaucracy: Authorization Restrictions in Medicare,"High administrative costs in U.S. health care have provoked concern among policymakers over potential waste, but many of these costs are generated by managed care policies that trade off bureaucratic costs against reductions in moral hazard. We study this trade-off for prior authorization restriction policies in Medicare Part D, where low-income beneficiaries are randomly assigned to default plans. Beneficiaries who face restrictions on a drug reduce their use of it by 26.8%. Approximately half of marginal beneficiaries are diverted to another related drug, while the other half are diverted to no drug. These policies generated net financial savings, reducing drug spending by $96 per beneficiary-year (3.6% of drug spending), while only generating approximately $10 in paperwork costs. Revealed preference approaches suggest that the cost savings likely exceed beneficiaries’ willingness to pay for foregone drugs. *We thank Frank Gaunt for excellent research assistance.

Email: vabson@hcp.med.harvard.edu Administrative costs make up a substantial portion of healthcare spending in the United States. Estimates suggest that these costs account for between 20 and 34% of health care expenditures (Woolhandler et al. 2003, Drum 2019, Dunn et al. 2020, Himmelstein et al. 2020), roughly 1-4% of GDP. The academic and policy discussion of the bureaucracies that generate these costs typically characterizes them as wasteful institutions, causing the U.S. healthcare system to be “on a production possibility frontier that is interior to that of other countries” (Cutler and Ly 2011). Eliminating these costs is often seen as a key component of proposals for U.S. health care reform, with the savings often proposed as a way to ‘pay for’ eligibility expansions and increases in generosity of public programs.1 However, half of administrative effort is spent on activities that aim to reduce healthcare utilization and spending, including policies such as auditing claims for fraud, overbilling, or wasteful care as well as enforcing compliance with managed care restrictions that limit access to costly providers, services, and drugs (Cutler 2020a, Chernew and Mintz 2021). While administrative costs can be reduced by making existing bureaucracy more efficient (Cutler et al. 2012), the outright elimination of administrative bureaucracy would also eliminate these activities, potentially resulting in utilization increases that would offset the savings. In this paper, we take seriously the idea that bureaucracy has both costs and benefits. Bureaucratic rationing mechanisms trade off administrative burden for potential reductions in moral hazard and lower costs of insurance provision. We characterize this trade-off for prior authorization restrictions for prescription drugs. Under such policies, patients can only receive insurance coverage for certain drugs (typically highcost, on-patent drugs) if they receive explicit authorization; otherwise they must pay the full cost out of pocket. Acquiring the necessary authorization requires the patient’s physician to fill out pre-specified paperwork making the case for why the patient should receive the drug. The goal of these policies is to restrict access to costly drugs to only those patients for whom those drugs provide the highest value. However, prior authorization comes with costs: Making authorization requests is a major source of administrative effort, requiring an average of 20.4 manpower hours per physician per week for physician practices in 2009 , their second greatest administrative burden behind billing (Casalino et al. 2009). 34% of physicians report having at least one staff member who works exclusively on prior authorization requests (AMA 2017). We conceptualize prior authorization as a tool for insurers to fight moral hazard problems, where generous insurance coverage may incentivize the use of low-value care (Pauly 1968). Prior authorization forms allow providers to directly communicate information to insurers about the patient’s suitability for the drug, helping resolve a key information asymmetry and allowing insurers to target coverage denials to low-value use. The effort required to fill out the associated paperwork also serves as an ordeal (Nichols and Zeckhauser 1982) that signals the provider’s beliefs about the patient’s suitability, beliefs that would not otherwise be credibly or objectively communicated. The welfare effects of this mechanism contrast the paperwork burden required for inframarginal patients who must go through the authorization process against the reductions in moral hazard for marginal patients who are deterred. Understanding the full welfare consequences of these policies therefore requires measuring the size and composition of these marginal and inframarginal groups. We study prior authorization empirically in Medicare Part D, the public drug insurance program for the One argument for single-payer reform is that traditional Medicare spends less per beneficiary in administration than private insurers (Archer 2011, Frakt 2018). Proponents of single-payer bills have argued that such reform would reduce administrative expenses by 50-60%, with this reduction having no effect on other outcomes (Pollin et al. 2018, Friedman 2019).",,2023.0,14,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3386/w30878', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3386/w30878?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3386/w30878, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b5b0547cb320010088447f043ebfffe61d56ea97,Editorial,"In this June 2024 issue of the Science Education International, we are proud to present an array of scholarly articles that highlight the diverse and innovative approaches to science education from ten different countries: Türkiye, Greece, Estonia, Latvia, Philippines, USA, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, and China. This collection underscores the global commitment to enhancing science education through varied methodologies, cultural contexts, and unique challenges. Some of these articles were presented at the 7th ICASE World Science and Technology Education Conference, held in Dubai between March 27 and 30, 2024, further enriching the discussions with insights shared among global experts. The first article is from Türkiye. The article mentions that the rise in STEM education has led to more authors promoting Arduino in STEM. While research exists on Arduino and STEM separately, more studies on their relationship are needed. This study uses software tools (Vosviewer, Biblioshiny) and bibliometric methods, analyzing documents from Scopus (2013-2022). Performance analysis showed publication and citation trends, highlighting top contributors. Bibliographic mapping revealed conceptual, intellectual, and social structures. Results indicated prolific authors and institutes in Türkiye, with the most cited from the USA. Türkiye may soon lead due to high growth rates and younger documents. The study warns of potential monopolization and highlights the need for increased researcher mobility and collaboration. Overall, Arduino shows great promise in future STEM activities. The second article is from Greece. The article surveys primary students in Greece on their views toward STEM education based on urban or rural settings and gender. The sample included 281 students from Attica and 69 from a Greek province. Data was collected via a close-ended digital questionnaire. Most students felt good at math and science but unlikely to pursue related careers. They reported strong communication and cooperation skills. Rural students showed more confidence in improving their math and science skills, the usefulness of STEM knowledge, and awareness of environmental issues. Boys showed slightly more interest in STEM careers. The study suggests further research on geographical, gender, and socioeconomic disparities in STEM education. The third article, a case study from Estonia, aimed to enhance pre-service science teachers’ readiness for integration, inquiry-based learning (IBL), ICT use, and real-life applications in teacher training. It explored their perceptions of these methods and how their views evolved over time. A questionnaire was administered to 50 pre-service science teachers before and after their 2-year training, with data analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings showed that teachers studying multiple science subjects valued integration, IBL, ICT use, and real-life examples more, with significant perception changes over time. Nearly half did not see IBL as crucial, and only a quarter recognized the importance of ICT. The fourth article is from Latvia. The article addresses that teacher competence management and development are now school responsibilities, but school leaders often lack the tools and experience. Competence management in schools can involve identifying and implementing professional development (PD) tailored to teachers' needs. Unlike the ""one size fits all"" approach, personalized PD can be more effective. This study focuses on identifying science teacher profiles to improve teaching that promotes student conceptual understanding (CU). Using a mixed-method approach, the performance of 26 urban science teachers was observed and analyzed. The study identified six distinct teacher profiles, demonstrating varied PD needs and offering a methodology for using lesson observation data to create teacher profiles in small samples. The fifth article is the second article from Greece. The study examines 12th-grade students' understanding of ""orbital"" and ""electron cloud"" concepts in quantum contexts (n=1 and n=2) through verbal and pictorial representations. It involved 192 students from six urban schools in Northern Greece using a paper-and-pencil assessment. Results show students struggle more with verbal explanations than pictorial ones and exhibit inconsistencies between these representations. They understand the electron cloud better verbally, but the orbital better pictorially. Representations for n=2 are more challenging than for n=1. Students were categorized into four classes based on their profiles, with implications for science education discussed. The sixth article is written by researchers from the Philippines and the USA. This meta-analysis study (2017-2021) assessed the impact of Socio-Scientific Issues (SSI)-based approaches on learners' conceptual understanding, environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior. Analyzing various SSI techniques, the findings revealed a strong positive influence on understanding complex environmental issues and promoting sustainable behavior. The study noted that SSI fosters critical thinking and engagement but also identified potential publication biases. It emphasized the need for context-specific strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration in climate change education. Overall, the SSI approach helps develop proactive, environmentally conscious citizens capable of addressing global issues. The seventh article is from USA. The study investigated the impact of an active project-based, aquaculture constructivist-learning program on high school students' perceptions. It aimed to determine if the program influenced students' interest, engagement, and future educational and career aspirations in STEM fields, both inside and outside the classroom. The study also sought to understand students' knowledge about aquaculture and skill development post-program participation. Qualitative data were gathered through post-student focus groups, teacher journal reflections, and public newspaper articles from three rural high schools in Kentucky. Four main themes emerged: (1) students demonstrated excitement and enthusiasm in the hands-on aquaculture program; (2) students exhibited attention to detail in aquaculture tasks, leading to increased responsibility; (3) students engaged collaboratively with their peers; and (4) there was a greater interest and confidence in STEM through practical application. The results indicated that the program engaged learners in real-world problem-solving and decision-making situations, fostering collaboration and enhancing skills such as responsibility and self-confidence in STEM. The eighth article is from Thailand. This research assessed the ability of Thai grade 10 students to construct scientific explanations and explored differences based on learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. The study involved 231 students from Phetchaburi province, Thailand, with 77.5% demonstrating moderate ability levels. Significant differences were found in students' ability levels based on their learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. The study also revealed correlations between students' ability levels and their learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. Students with higher learning achievement, positive attitudes, and attendance at larger schools tended to have higher ability levels. However, there was no significant relationship between students' attitudes toward science and school size. These findings emphasize the importance of considering individual differences and backgrounds, particularly in terms of learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size, when teaching science. The ninth article is from United Arab Emirates (UAE). This mixed-approach study explores the effects of virtual science laboratories on students' motivation and attitude toward science. Conducted in an American curriculum private school in Dubai, the research surveyed 237 students from grades 7 to 11. Results show that virtual laboratories positively impact students' overall motivation, including intrinsic motivation, perceived usefulness, effort, perceived self-efficacy, and attitude toward science. Perceived self-efficacy and perceived usefulness significantly influence students' attitudes toward science, with perceived self-efficacy being a predictor of their effort. The tenth article is from South Africa. This study examines the effectiveness of Khan Academy Videos (KAVs) in rural thermodynamics education. 88 students were divided into two groups: one taught traditionally (control group [CG]) and the other using KAVs (experimental group [EG]). Results show significant improvement in learning outcomes and engagement with KAVs, with EG scores increasing by 61% compared to 31% in the CG. Pre-tests and post-tests were used to measure academic performance, and a mixed-method approach analyzed results and feedback. The study highlights the positive impact of KAV integration on student performance, especially in resource-limited rural schools, suggesting its transformative potential in enhancing teaching quality. The eleventh article is from China. The article analyzes 30 documents from Web of Science and CNKI databases to compare and understand the role of science teachers in China and overseas. The research highlights slow development in both Chinese and English publications, with most studies in theoretical exploration. The role of science teachers encompasses five main aspects: Role expectation, role orientation, role identification, role transformation, and role enactment. Combining the ""should be"" research from Chinese publications with the ""real"" research from English publications could lead to a more comprehensive understanding and positive interaction. This analysis provides a basis for future research on the role of science teachers.

095d0ca19a6fbb0f48f6e3d745923a600e108281,Conservation in the Herbarium: Procedures and Techniques for Restoration in the Collections,"Kew Herbarium was established almost 200 years ago and is recognised as a globally important research facility, holding preserved plant material collected mostly over a time span of 170 years. The collections are used extensively by a global community of researchers: 5,000 specimen loans and samples are shipped out worldwide for research, and the herbarium in London clocks up an impressive 3,000 visitor-days annually according to Kew Science Collections Strategy 2018–2028. This valuable resource requires careful management to ensure appropriate standards are maintained, including essential conservation work of the collections. This presentation outlines some of Kew Herbarium’s crucial conservation requirements and priorities. 
 Kew’s Herbarium is one of the largest in the world, with around seven million pressed plant specimens and additional carpological, or bulky plant collections. The first purpose-built wing of Kew Herbarium was constructed in 1877 when there was a need for greater space due to botanical exploration of the British Empire. Subsequent wings were added between 1902 and 1969, with further expansion into the basement, and a modern wing added in 2009. Most of the building pre-dates climate control yet best practice standards in collections care, such as pest management, have generally been exemplary throughout the herbarium’s history, although conservation work has been sparse. The alleged threats and controversy to the safety of the collection in its present location and the proposed relocation of Kew Herbarium have been well publicised this past year. 
 Meanwhile, the four-year mass digitisation of the herbarium (and fungarium) began in 2022, to provide high-resolution images and label transcriptions, made freely available online via the new Kew Data Portal. During the mass digitisation project, numerous issues were found in the collections requiring skilled conservation work. By the very nature of a large and busy herbarium, repeated use of the collections over decades or even centuries causes wear and tear, and the project presents itself as an opportunity for those specimens to receive preventive and remedial conservation. Typical damage incurred includes plant parts and labels becoming loose or detached from the backing sheets; deteriorated, dusty, torn sheets and labels; residue of pest and mould damage. Digitisation Officers on the front-line of the ongoing imaging process are extracting physical specimens from their workflow, which require urgent need of repair. Additionally, the removal of redundant or surplus barcodes from herbarium sheets due to human error has added to the need for conservation work. 
 We initially recruited a 12-week Project Conservator intending to understand conservation concerns arising from the digitisation project and to advise on, and undertake, the various specialist tasks—a role that has subsequently been extended to one year. With a clear plan in place and a list of priorities requiring attention, the first job was to familiarise our new conservator—the first ever employed specifically to work with Kew’s herbarium collections—with the inner workings of the herbarium. 
 Jana Kostalikova came to Kew as an experienced Paper and Collection Care Conservator, having worked in museums, historic houses and libraries, and archive collections. We soon realised that a working scientific collection such as Kew Herbarium required our new conservator to adjust her usual working practices. Herbarium specimens are in a constant state of flux, e.g., new determination labels being added, or samples being removed. Therefore, Jana’s conservation requirement has had to involve a pragmatic approach in line with improving the condition of specimens to allow for repeated and extensive use, whilst following conservation standards of practice. 
 This new role initially involved a degree of investigation into appropriate needs for preventive and remedial conservation following the guidance of herbarium users. Whilst plenty of literature is available, for example, on the conservation and preservation of zoological and entomological natural history collections, we found limited documentation about treatments relating to herbarium specimens. The lack of literature on the conservation, cleaning, repairing and re-housing of herbarium sheets and bulky carpological specimens could perhaps be a consequence of plant blindness. Few, if any herbaria have a designated conservator, and specialism for herbarium or botanical conservation training seems limited at best, with herbaria largely relying on gained experience from curators and researchers to undertake this work. 
 At Kew Herbarium, the Project Conservator’s guidance has now resulted in herbarium curation staff being better informed about appropriate conservation standards and best practices. Jana is creating reports and working protocols with before-and-after instructional photos, literature citations and surveys. For example, the treatment of mouldy specimens has resulted in a condition survey to monitor the air quality of the collection buildings and the use of air filtration in the worst affected areas; a standard operational procedure for workflows in cleaning specimens; provision of a permanent working space for treatment; and health and safety awareness. Work is still progressing on cleaning mould-impacted specimens, to fully understand the requirements, with advice being sought from mycologists at Kew Fungarium. Successes from the Project Conservator to date have been the sharing of learned experiences, expertise and knowledge by all parties; having open discussions with various stakeholders to resolve conflicting opinions; bridging the gap between departments such as digitisation, curators, and researchers; and providing information, supervision and instructions on good conservation practice.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139238', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.139238?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139238, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1dc2fb4a2cef456f701ab82c4cca25f913480716,An extensive database of airborne trace gas and meteorological observations from the Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX),"Abstract. The Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) flew
scientific flights between 2011 and 2018 providing measurements of trace gas
species and meteorological parameters over California and Nevada, USA. This
paper describes the observations made by the AJAX program over 229 flights
and approximately 450 h of flying. AJAX was a multi-year,
multi-objective, multi-instrument program with a variety of sampling
strategies resulting in an extensive dataset of interest to a wide variety
of users. Some of the more common flight objectives include satellite
calibration/validation (GOSAT, OCO-2, TROPOMI) at Railroad Valley and other
locations and long-term observations of free-tropospheric and boundary layer
ozone allowing for studies of stratosphere-to-troposphere transport and
long-range transport to the western United States. AJAX also performed
topical studies such as sampling wildfire emissions, urban outflow and
atmospheric rivers. Airborne measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone,
formaldehyde, water vapor, temperature, pressure and 3-D winds made by the
AJAX program have been published at NASA's Airborne Science Data Center (https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/AJAXTS9 (last access: 1 November 2022), https://doi.org/10.5067/ASDC/SUBORBITAL/AJAX/DATA001,

After collecting the necessary data, a cost comparison is made between solar and conventional irrigation technologies. The cost of each technology is then compared using a 25-year lifespan to determine which one will be less expensive. Since there are additional important factors to consider while selecting the optimal technology, a multi-criteria analysis is done too. The cost comparison reveals that, in contrast to the other two, the solar system has higher startup expenditures but lower ongoing operating and maintenance costs. According to the cost analysis of the three technologies, solar technology is significantly less expensive than electric and diesel alternatives. Aside from the cost, electric irrigation technology appears to be a better option than solar and diesel technologies when considering other aspects like farmer satisfaction, necessary installation land, technology accessibility, weather obstruction, etc.

96aaf46de8df11f74d5fa2341f1b1186d2b63f92,Preface to special topic on Tri-Co Robots,"The invention of the Unimate in the 1950s marked the landmark beginning of a 70-year boom in robotics. Today, the morphology, functionality and missions of robots have undergone revolutionary changes. Space robots taking over on-orbit services, surgical robots remotely controlled by doctors, dexterous wearable prosthetic hands, and robotic tools for manufacturing large parts have far exceeded expectations when industrial robots first emerged. There is an urgent need for new theories, methods, and technologies to meet these new trends. Summarizing the common features of the above scenarios, we propose the concept of ‘Tri-Co Robots’, which stands for Coexisting-Cooperative-Cognitive Robots, focusing on the basic theories and key technologies that enhance the robot’s capability of interacting with humans, the environment and other peer robots. In 2017, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) launched the Tri-Co Robot major researchprogram.Under this program, anumberof fundedprojects have achieved remarkable progress in the past five years. In this special topic, we have selected a few representative works that demonstrate our perspectives on Tri-Co Robots and their future directions. It is worth noting, however, that we do welcome and look forward to a richer interpretation of Tri-Co Robots. Robots have played important roles in manufacturing automation in the past; advances in robotics are transforming the paradigm of manufacturing today. Xie et al. report worldwide attempts on developing mobile robotic milling machines featuring a new manufacturing mode as ‘fixing the part, moving the machine’. To ensure the milling quality of large-scale, lightweight, and low-rigidity parts, dual-robot mirror milling has exhibited great potential and thus multi-robot cooperation and collaboration turn out to be an important topic. Climbing robots that can literally climb along large parts and conduct in-situ machining represent another type of ‘craftsmen’ robots for intelligent manufacturing. Climbing manufacturing robots, comprehensively reviewed by Tao et al., pose several key challenges regarding the adhesion principle, motion mechanism, positioning technology and control methods. Similarly, the utilization of multiple climbing robots for collaborative manufacturing is also an inevitable trend. To address the important challenges of robot-robot collaboration, Duan et al. review the collective behaviors of animals and the bioinspired swarm intelligence in cooperative cluster systems. They foresee the trend of adopting the cooperation of robotic systems to realize the multiplicative and exponential increase of the task capability. Extreme environments impose challenging constraints on robot operation, and therefore, require robots with an enhanced ability to interact with the environment. Li et al. present the recent progress on space robots for on-orbit servicing, including well-established missions and ongoing proof-of-concept investigations. From search and rescue after earthquakes and nuclear explosions to extraterrestrial explorations, legged robots have the potential to outperform wheeled or tracked robots over irregular and harsh terrains. Gao et al. review the technical progress of multi-legged robots in mechanical design, actuators, controls, planning, and perception, as well as real-world applications in recent years, including their skiing and skating hexapod robots debuted in the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games. In Ding et al.’s article, they propose an unsupervised learning framework for legged robots to learn the physical characteristics of terrains, endowing robots with better environmental adaptability.This work is an excellent example of showing how artificial intelligence plays a role in enhancing robot interactivity. The development of human-centered robots, such as robotic prostheses and surgical robots, are growing rapidly nowadays. Gong et al.’s perspective discusses the principle-related and practical challenges regarding developing robotic prosthetic hands. Among many other challenges, the human-machine interface is critical for actual reconstruction of missing human limbs. Jiang et al. focus on recent progress in surface electromyogram neuralinterfaces for intuitive prosthetic control in their review paper, and they believe affordable functional replacement for amputees is still a long way off. Bio-syncretic robots directly utilizing biological materials as their functional cores may benefit the robot’s human-centered applications, due to their advantageous biocompatibility to avoid any immune response, as mentioned by Zhang et al. At the end of this special issue, in Li’s interview with Prof. Guang-Zhong Yang, a medical roboticist, Prof. Yang shares his thoughts on Tri-Co Robots and their roles in medical treatment and rehabilitation. Robotics is a rapidly-evolving field that requires a close collaboration over a wide spectrum of specialties, together with cooperation between academia and industry. With the deepening of such broader collaborations, we envision Tri-Co Robots taking over more challenging tasks in the near future.",National Science Review,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwad037/49514979/nwad037.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10089569, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b4a945a282dee7fa97843dfb5a173cb99a2320f4,Epidemiology in sailing: A systematic literature review including suggestions for injury prevention,"Introduction & Purpose 
Sailing is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide and as varied as the disciplines in sailing are the injuries. According to the definition of Neville and Folland (2009, p. 141), sailing injuries can be defined as “any physical complaint sustained by a sailor that results from sailing or sailing-related activities”, whereby sailing-related illnesses have been excluded from this review. Most of the literature focuses separately either on elite sailing, recreational sailing, or offshore circumnavigations. This systematic literature review, in contrast, aimed to combine all these different types of sailing. The aim of this study was, thus, 1) to highlight the frequencies, types, locations, and causes of injuries in sailing, and 2) to summarize possible preventive measures. 
Methods 
Following the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search limited to research published from 01.01.2005 to 10.05.2024 was performed electronically in the databases PubMed and Cochrane Library using the keywords “sailing” AND “injuries”. Exclusion criteria were non-English language and literature reviews. The literature search resulted in a total of 132 publications, thereof 112 were excluded based on their title, which was either double, not related to the disciplines of sailing or the topic of injuries. The remaining 20 publications were screened based on their abstracts. In this second round of filtering, 10 publications were excluded as they were not related to the disciplines of sailing and the topic of injuries. Finally, 10 publications were included in the present review. The selected literature was screened for the five categories of injury frequencies, types, locations, causes, and preventive measures associated with sailing. 
Results 
Injury frequency including time loss injuries and fatalitiesIn general, sailing-related injury rates vary strongly from 0.59 to 16 per 1,000 hours of sailing (Feletti et al., 2021; Neville et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2016). Thereby, sailing was ranked among the safest sports in the Olympic Games 2008; moreover, in the Olympics 2012, 1.0% of sailors sustained an injury resulting in time loss (Ryan et al., 2016). No differences in the injury rate between sexes could be observed (Crunkhorn et al., 2022). The calculated fatality rate amounts to 1.19 deaths per million sailing days (Ryan et al., 2016). 
Injury types and locationsIn sailing, the most commonly injured body parts are the upper limbs (40% of all reported sailing injuries), followed by the spine, back, neck, and head (14-30%) and the lower limbs (10-27%) (Feletti et al., 2021; Ham & Jee, 2016; Hayes et al., 2023; Landsberg & Hunt, 2023; Nathanson et al., 2010; Neville et al., 2006). The most frequently reported injuries are mild injuries such as contusions (27-40%), lacerations (19%), and abrasions (11%), which can potentially occur on the hand, shoulder, arm, knee, foot, and ankle (Feletti et al., 2021; Forycka et al., 2023; Hayes et al., 2023) as well as muscle cramps/spasms (20%) and strains/sprains (13%; Tan et al., 2016). Also, sunburns are highly frequent with 16% of all surveyed cases (Nathanson et al., 2010). Moreover, in professional sailing, overuse injuries are accountable for 24-58% of all reported injuries and primarily affect joints and ligaments (Neville et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2016). Furthermore, severe injury types include fractures (25%), torn tendons/cartilage (16%), and brain concussion (14%; Nathanson et al., 2010). 
Injury risks and causesInjuries sustained during sailing can be attributed to extrinsic as well as intrinsic risk factors. Some of the most commonly identified extrinsic causes are related to environmental conditions, such as heavy weather and solar exposure (Hayes et al., 2023; Nathanson et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2016). Further, lack of protective equipment and material failure (Nathanson et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2016) as well as impacts with part of the boat, in particular the boom, (Forycka et al., 2023; Landsberg & Hunt, 2023; Tan et al., 2016) pose major causes of injuries. Hayes et al. (2023) found that smaller boat sizes are related to a higher rate of incidents. Intrinsic risk factors include sailors’ inattentiveness, lack of communication among crew members, inadequate physical fitness, sleep deprivation, and insufficient experience (Forycka et al., 2023; Ham & Jee, 2016; Nathanson et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2016). Nevertheless, a low level of sailing credentials was not found to increase the injury risk (Hayes et al., 2023). Additionally, different repetitive tasks contribute to overuse injuries (Neville et al., 2006). Moreover, alcohol consumption has been shown to play a role in 12.2% of sailing-related deaths (Ryan et al., 2016). Finally, the most common fatal incidents are due to collisions, grounding, and falling overboard (Ryan et al., 2016). Thereby, 81.6% of deaths can be linked to not wearing a life jacket (Ryan et al., 2016). 
Preventive measuresTo prevent injuries, (UV-)protective equipment, such as gloves, helmets, shoes, insulating cloths, hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen, should be used (Feletti et al., 2021; Nathanson et al., 2010). As the likelihood of accidents rises with shorter boat sizes, Hayes et al. (2023) recommended increasing the minimum boat length. Besides, ergonomic boat design needs to be applied (Nathanson et al., 2010). To prevent accidents, gaining confidence with the boat is paramount (Hayes et al., 2023). In addition, physical training needs to be included in the sailing routine at all levels (Feletti et al., 2021; Ham & Jee, 2016). Furthermore, sufficient sleep and distraction limitation should be ensured (Forycka et al., 2023). Feletti et al. (2021) suggested regularly changing the ropes to maintain a soft structure. Mandatory first aid training and equipment are further fundamental preventive measures (Forycka et al., 2023; Hayes et al., 2023; Landsberg & Hunt, 2023). Moreover, the prohibition of being intoxicated should be extended to passengers (Ryan et al., 2016). Finally, sailors should be convinced to wear life jackets, which can be facilitated by improving their comfort and aesthetics (Nathanson et al., 2010). Educational campaigns should foster these safety habits continuously (Nathanson et al., 2010). 
Discussion 
The results demonstrate a strongly varying injury rate of 0.59 to 16 per 1,000 hours of sailing (Feletti et al., 2021; Neville et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2016), which was found to be lower than in contact team sports, such as soccer, but similar to the incidence reported in non-contact sports, such as professional cricket (Neville et al., 2006). The calculated fatality rate of 1.19 deaths per million sailing days is comparable to the fatality rate in alpine skiing (Ryan et al., 2016). The presented risk factors lead to the suggestion of various preventive measures. Several of them, inter alia sun-protective behaviour, promotion of safety gear, coaching on proper sailing technique, physical training as well as first-aid education and equipment are deemed to be advantageous (Nathanson et al., 2010; Neville et al., 2006). However, it is questionable if other identified prevention steps, like increasing the boat size (Hayes et al., 2023) or frequently renewing the ropes (Feletti et al., 2021), automatically represent safety enhancements as the associated increase in boat weight and rope slipperiness could impair boat handling. 
Conclusion 
The present literature examination updates characteristics as well as possible risk factors for injuries in all sailing disciplines and summarizes related potential preventive measures. Further research should systematically assess the effectiveness of the different prevention options suggested. To increase safety within the sailing disciplines, the vigorous implementation of such preventive measures on the part of sailing federations seems to be of uttermost importance.

7afa9b40e77de947a458eff93f7301842fb5bd08,Applying Bostock: The Queer Case Against Public Single-Sex Schooling,"Public single-sex schooling in the United States is a relatively novel phenomenon purporting to provide a tailored pedagogy that segregates students by their “sex” and teaches according to prescribed gender norms. While some education policy scholars have debated the question of public single-sex schooling as a matter of policy, scholars have yet to confront the potential legal challenges following the United States Supreme Court’s Bostock v. Clayton County decision. This is especially notable as students increasingly defy gender norms on which single-sex schooling is based. This Article seeks to provide a queer perspective on public single-sex schooling by questioning its pedagogical foundations and challenging the idea that public sex-segregated schooling can adequately distance itself from sex-essentialist pedagogies that exclude queer, trans, intersex, and non-binary students. First, this Article offers a historic overview of the modern advent and recent expansion of single-sex schooling in United States public schools. Second, this Article provides a critique of single-sex schooling, especially of the harm it causes to queer, trans, intersex, and non-binary students. By critiquing “school choice” models of single-sex schooling and focusing on the harms of single-sex schooling to straight and cisgender students as well as queer, trans, intersex, and nonbinary students, this Article reveals how sex-stereotyping harms all students, albeit through varied and dynamic means. The United States Supreme Court’s Bostock v. Clayton County decision expanding the definition of “sex” to include “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” renders public single-sex schools newly vulnerable to Title IX and Equal Protection Clause challenges. The Article concludes by comparing the harms of single-sex schooling experienced by students with distinct _____________________________ * Juris Doctor & Master of Education Policy Candidate, University of Pennsylvania.

I. A BRIEF HISTORY OF MODERN SINGLE-SEX PUBLIC EDUCATION INTRODUCTION Discussion of public K–12 single-sex schooling in the United States, historically confined to closed-door school board meetings, has rapidly expanded over the past two decades into a debate that draws passionate responses from across the political spectrum. Many conversations surrounding public single-sex schooling have focused on the viability of gender-oriented pedagogies, with some fringe proponents suggesting such schooling be made compulsory. Contemporary legal literature debating the benefits and harms of single-sex schooling has not yet centered the experiences of queer, trans, intersex, and non-binary students, a glaring omission in light of these students’ increasing visibility and persistent vulnerability. _____________________________ 1.

For the purposes of this paper, I define “queer” to be consistent with Merriam Webster’s third proffered definition, defining the word to mean “of, relating to, or being a person whose sexual orientation is not heterosexual and/or whose gender identity is not cisgender.” queer, MERRIAM-WEBSTER, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/queer (last visited Oct. 6, 2022). I define “trans” to be consistent with Stonewall’s definition of the term “describ[ing] people whose gender is not the same as, or does not sit comfortably with, the sex they were assigned at birth,” but want to note that trans identities are diverse and that such short definitions are frequently unable to account for the plethora of identities included in the phrase.

CAMPAIGN, https://www.hrc.org/resources/glossary-of-terms (last visited Oct. 6, 2022), but point out that, as with all terms defined here, the usage of “non-binary” is fluid and used in a multitude of different contexts. It is plausible to predict that many of these terms may change in meaning or adapt with time and may become popularly outdated in the years to come. Fall 2022 The Queer Case Against Public Single-Sex Education 187 This Article outlines the contemporary history of public K–12 single-sex schooling in the United States, reexamining notions of brain (or neuro) essentialism and school choice in the context of sexsegregated schooling. Most importantly, this Article provides an overview of how the current doctrine surrounding public single-sex schooling harms cisgender-heterosexual, queer, non-binary, intersex, and trans people, and concludes by applying the Supreme Court’s recent Bostock v. Clayton County decision to single-sex public education. Although the legal boundaries between permissible and impermissible sex-segregated schooling remain somewhat unclear, this Article explores identifiable harms of single-sex schooling on potential classes of plaintiffs. A. The Advent of Modern Public Sex-Segregated Schools Although only a small number of selective and vocational public single-sex schools existed prior to the 1970s, the advent of modern-day sex-segregated schooling dates back to the landmark Title IX provisions of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX stipulates that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” Although the constitutional limitations on sex-segregated schooling derive from the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment through its language stipulating that “nor [shall any State] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,” Title IX was the first federal statute interpreted to explicitly prohibit sex discrimination in public educational programs, including schools that exclude students from enrollment on the basis of sex. _____________________________ 4.

U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1. 7. 34 C.F.R. § 106.31 (1975). 188 Journal of Law & Education Vol. 51, No. 2 Two years after Title IX’s passage, the Equal Educational Opportunity Act (EEOA) of 1974 declared that “all children enrolled in public schools are entitled to equal educational opportunity without regard to race, color, sex, or national origin.” This language was, to some scholars’ surprise, later dismissed by courts in its application to sex-segregated schooling. Only a year later, the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights issued regulations that prohibited single-sex schooling except in narrow contexts. School districts then began to defend their practices against lawsuits in court, such as the School District of Philadelphia’s backing of the all-male Central High School, which would become the centerpiece of the Vorchheimer v. School District of Philadelphia case in 1977. In Vorchheimer, the Supreme Court passed up an opportunity to provide clear jurisprudence on the constitutionality of single-sex schooling, with an equally-divided Court affirming the Third Circuit’s holding without opinion. State courts later found Central High School’s all-male admissions policy unconstitutional as courts across the United States began to prohibit unequal sex-segregated schooling. The United States Supreme Court also ruled that Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination as a condition for federal assistance did not infringe upon the First Amendment rights of educational institutions. Despite these legal defeats, advocates for gender-essentialist pedagogies nonetheless continued to argue that essential biological differences in learning styles between boys and girls justified single-sex schooling.

dfaf4c1573c774a9c80320d48e8c7b064e2669f5,LIVESTOCK FARMING AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT: CURRENT EXPERIENCES,"The first Editorial article of 2025 will focus on the challenges facing managers of agriculture and livestock production agribusinesses, from the large commercial scale down to the small scale, including subsistence production systems, and how these challenges can be overcome with changes to management through technology, innovative breeding genetic practices, or educational skill's intensive programs.
The greatest challenges that contemporary agriculture is facing is a growing food need using fewer resources. It is therefore crucial to apply technical and scientific advancements systematically in feeding, nutrition, genetics, reproduction, animal health control, and general improvement of animal husbandry to fill the coming productivity gaps. One way to achieve these expected productivity requirements can be by improving the genetics, health, and more efficacy of animal husbandry. In this situation native breeds of rabbits are playing an important role. The choice of breed or strain of rabbits on a farm should account for the capacity of animals to adapt and thrive under local conditions as well as their potential to resist disease. In recent years, animal husbandry based on quantitative genetics has begun applied, which led to significantly increased and streamlined animal production. However, the implementation of genetic markers in breeding programs has been quite limited for technological reasons. Currently, at the NPPC in Luzianky, Department of Nutrition and Small Farm Animals is running a research project (APVV 20-0037), financed by the Slovak Research and Development Agency (APVV), that focus on genomic selection based on markers of single nucleotide polymorphism, that offers new opportunities to select the most suitable animals for breeding purposes, in relation to selected traits, performance characteristics, or natural disease resistance. The principle of this methodology is the use of the quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with a particular phenotypic trait and its subsequent use in selection. Genomic selection is a type of Marker-Assisted Selection in which breeding value of animals can be accurately estimated with the help of dense maker map of chromosomes without information about their phenotype or that of close relatives. The aims and originality of the project are given the complexity of looking at the possibility to find and using the polymorphism in selected membrane receptors genes and their use in balancing selection of native rabbits and chickens breed aimed on prediction and higher efficiency of production potential, quality, reproduction and viability. The running project is based on the latest global study of genetics and immunogenetics, focusing on their impact and possibility of use in animals' selection.
The ""management"" in Agriculture is an essential piece of the business behind farms. Under the theme:
""How Can Education Meet Agribusiness Challenges? Skills, Knowledge, and Practical Solutions for Agribusiness – Example of e-AgriMBA"", an interactive seminar will take place at Faculty of Economics and Management, SUA in Nitra, Slovakia, on 28th March 2025, bringing together academics, industry representatives, and students to discuss how education can bridge the skills gap in agribusiness. The session will explore practical knowledge, digital competencies, and sustainability-driven solutions, showcasing the e-AgriMBA Learning System as a model for accessible, industry-aligned, and environmentally responsible higher education.
The e-AgriMBA project is developing a pan-European electronic learning system to enhance sustainable MBA education in agribusiness. By expanding the portfolio of existing MBA programs and integrating digital learning tools, the initiative strengthens higher education institutions' capacity to meet evolving industry demands.
Implemented by a consortium of six universities within the AgriMBA network, which has been accrediting MBA programs since 1990, the project also aims to establish a new MBA program at the Technical University of Moldova. A key focus is ensuring inclusivity by offering opportunities for students with fewer resources while promoting digital and language skills essential for the sustainable transformation of agribusiness education.
A project meeting will also take place in Nitra alongside the seminar, allowing partners to assess progress and discuss the implementation of online teaching tools.

In the first Editorial article of 2025, I am going to introduce the contents of the articles collected and published in the first issue of 2025 year.
Akpan et al. designed a research to identify genotypic variants in pituitary specific transcription factor-1 (PIT-1) gene and determine the relationship between PIT-1 genotypic variants and growth rate indices, with non-linear growth model parameters in FUNAAB Alpha chickens. The study found an association between PIT-1 genotypic variants and growth curve parameters; the Gompertz model was found to be the most appropriate non-linear model for describing growth in FUNAAB alpha chickens.
Jimoh et al. performed a feeding trial to investigate the use of decorticated sandbox seeds (SBS, Hura crepitans) as a source of methionine in broiler production. It was concluded that the use of decorticated SBS, as a source of methionine in broiler production, has no detrimental effect on nutrient utilization and blood profile.
Cavallo et al. implemented a study with the objective to evaluate the adaptation of mid-lactating Holstein cows regarding their introduction at the automatic milking system (AMS) and its effect on behaviour and milk performance. Results suggest that the adaptability of the cows to the automatic milking system may also depend on the individual behaviour of cows and not only on the environment around them. Therefore, it is necessary to apply new livestock management strategies, when AMS (as a free-traffic system) is going to displace the milking parlour in order to better fine-tune the adaptation of cows (especially for heifers) and also to select cows that respond best to the robotic milking system.
Adeleye et al. investigated the effect of equi-energy replacement of native maize with extruded maize on the growth performance, energy utilization indices and post-prandial glucose response of broiler chicken. This study suggests that extruded maize, as an equi-energy replacement for native maize, improves growth performance and flock uniformity in broiler chickens.

bae00bdadd803718a60720676347fa6f71d61e9e,Quantifying multiple burdens of dairy cattle production diseases and reproductive inefficiency: current knowledge and proposed metrics.,"The economic burden of diseases and reproductive inefficiency in dairy cattle is evident and has been quantified. Dairy diseases and reproductive inefficiency are however associated with other issues as well, including animal welfare, environmental pressure, and public health risks. Quantifying these other issues is becoming important to help farmers making decisions. Quantification of the non-economic burdens of diseases and reproductive inefficiency is rare and lacks an overview of approaches and metrics. The first aim of this paper is to provide trends for associating diseases and reproductive inefficiency with economic and non-economic burdens of disease. The second aim is to provide a review of approaches and metrics used to quantify the non-economic burdens of disease and reproductive inefficiency. For the economic burden of diseases and reproductive performance, only an overview of the approaches used to quantify the burden is provided. The final aim is to propose approaches and metrics for future quantification of non-economic burdens caused by individual diseases. A literature search was conducted in Web of Science to identify scientific articles on mastitis, lameness, metabolic disorders and reproductive inefficiency in dairy cows. The search was restricted to articles published between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2022 and resulted in 7,565 articles. The total number of articles that mentioned the economic, animal welfare, public health, and environmental burden was 1,253, 428, 291, and 77, respectively. An increase in the percentage of articles mentioning the economic, animal welfare, and public health burden is observed between 2010 and 2022. Despite the 2,049 articles that mentioned one of the burdens, the results showed that approximately 10% of the articles quantified one or more of these burdens. The economic burden of diseases and reproductive inefficiency has been quantified in 154 articles and very few articles quantified the non-economic burdens (9 articles for environment, 29 articles for public health and 2 articles for animal welfare). Eleven articles were identified that quantified multiple burdens, and in all these studies the economic burden was combined with a non-economic burden through a modeling approach (mainly simulation). We propose to link the non-economic burdens to biological simulation models, and thus develop bio-burden simulation models. Well-established approaches and metrics can be used to quantify economic, environmental, and public health burdens. For the economic impact, costs per cow per year can be assessed. A life cycle assessment can be performed for environmental impact and the public health impact can be assessed by a defined daily dose for antimicrobial use and disability-adjusted life years for zoonotic diseases. Regarding animal welfare, approaches and metrics to quantify the welfare impact of a diseased animal are not well established. For animal welfare, we propose a welfare-adjusted life years approach. The mentioned approaches and metrics are a proposal, and it is up to the scientific community to use them or, based on empirics and research experience, propose changes so that we will end up with robust approaches and metrics that enable us to compare research results and provide more evidence for animal health decision makers.",Journal of Dairy Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2023-24538', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3168/jds.2023-24538?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2023-24538, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Health economic evaluations, the comparative analysis of alternative interventions in terms of their costs and consequences, have been promoted as an important tool to inform decision-making. The objective of this study will be to investigate the extent to which articles of economic evaluations of healthcare interventions indexed in MEDLINE incorporate research practices that promote transparency, openness and reproducibility. Methods and analysis This is the study protocol for a cross-sectional comparative analysis. We registered the study protocol within the Open Science Framework (osf.io/gzaxr). We will evaluate a random sample of 600 cost-effectiveness analysis publications, a specific form of health economic evaluations, indexed in MEDLINE during 2012 (n=200), 2019 (n=200) and 2022 (n=200). We will include published papers written in English reporting an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of costs per life years gained, quality-adjusted life years and/or disability-adjusted life years. Screening and selection of articles will be conducted by at least two researchers. Reproducible research practices, openness and transparency in each article will be extracted using a standardised data extraction form by multiple researchers, with a 33% random sample (n=200) extracted in duplicate. Information on general, methodological and reproducibility items will be reported, stratified by year, citation of the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement and journal. Risk ratios with 95% CIs will be calculated to represent changes in reporting between 2012–2019 and 2019–2022. Ethics and dissemination Due to the nature of the proposed study, no ethical approval will be required. All data will be deposited in a cross-disciplinary public repository. It is anticipated the study findings could be relevant to a variety of audiences.

 It is an honour and a pleasure to wish to all actors of the ASME Journal of Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Science (Chair, Editors, Authors, Readers, and Reviewers) my New Year's greetings. This 2022 year must be seen towards an exit of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, looking for better perspectives. We must capitalize on the best of this period and on the way out of the health crisis. Even in this extremely difficult context, the links still existed. They were even been strengthened by showing more solidarity, support and mutual aid. We must keep these qualities within our scientific community, because we must now face a new decisive challenge: responding to a very strong increase in carbon-free energy demand. In order to meet this challenge, nuclear energy has a major role to play among all other non-CO2 emitting sources of energy. Its great flexibility and massive production capacity makes it a perfect complement to renewable production systems.",Journal of Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4052719', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1115/1.4052719?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4052719, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

277916c52543d11f06aaadf7786f4211320e0337,Models of Telehealth Service Delivery in Adults With Spinal Cord Injuries: Scoping Review,"Background In Canada, approximately 86,000 people live with spinal cord injury (SCI), and there are an estimated 3675 new cases of traumatic or nontraumatic etiology per year. Most people with SCI will experience secondary health complications, such as urinary and bowel issues, pain syndrome, pressure ulcers, and psychological disorders, resulting in severe chronic multimorbidity. Moreover, people with SCI may face barriers in accessing health care services, such as primary care physicians’ expert knowledge regarding secondary complications related to SCI. Telehealth, defined as the delivery of information and health-related services through telecommunication technologies, may help address some of the barriers, and indeed, the present global COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of integration of telehealth in health care systems. As a result of this crisis, health care providers have increased the usage of telehealth services, providing health services to individuals in need of community-based supportive care. However, the evidence on models of telehealth service delivery for adults with SCI has not been previously synthesized. Objective The purpose of this scoping review was to identify, describe, and compare models of telehealth services for community-dwelling adults with SCI. Methods This scoping review follows the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Studies published between 1990 and December 31, 2022, were identified by searching the Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases. Papers with specified inclusion criteria were screened by 2 investigators. Included articles focused on identifying, implementing, or evaluating telehealth interventions, including primary health care services and self-management services delivered in the community and home-based settings. One investigator performed a full-text review of each article, and data extraction included (1) study characteristics; (2) participant characteristics; (3) key characteristics of the interventions, programs, and services; and (4) outcome measures and results. Results A total of 61 articles reported telehealth services used for preventing, managing, or treating the most common secondary complications and consequences of SCI, including chronic pain, low physical activity, pressure ulcers, and psychosocial dysfunction. Where evidence exists, improvements in community participation, physical activity, and reduction in chronic pain, pressure ulcers, etc, following SCI were demonstrated. Conclusions Telehealth may offer an efficient and effective option for health service delivery for community-dwelling individuals with SCI, ensuring continuity of rehabilitation, follow-up after hospital discharge, and early detection, management, or treatment of potential secondary complications following SCI. We recommend that the stakeholders involved with patients with SCI consider the uptake of hybridized (blend of web-based and in-person) health care delivery models to optimize the care continuum and self-management of SCI-related care. The findings of this scoping review may be used to inform policy makers, health care professionals, and stakeholders engaged in establishing web-based clinics for individuals with SCI.",JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies,2023.0,8,"{'url': 'https://jmir.org/api/download?alt_name=rehab_v10i1e41186_app1.pdf&filename=b03b4b954e35e345008375b3b8557a9c.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10365587, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ca5e36fa3cc5979c4b473480a6e84a78d2d2be3d,27th NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC PRACTICAL CONFERENCE “NATURAL SCIENCE EDUCATION IN A COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL – 2021”: CONFERENCE REVIEW,"The scientific-practical conference “Natural Science Education in a Comprehensive School - 2021”, which has already become a tradition, was held in an unusual way, remotely (online). This format of the conference was determined by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, so the conference could not take place in the usual format for the second time. This time, the plenary session of the conference was truly international and extremely interesting. In total, four key reports were presented in plenary. 
It is fair to say that the plenary has 'united' different continents: Africa (presenter: Dr Angela James from South Africa), Latin America (Dr Solange Locatelli from Brazil), Europe (Dr Mihail Calalb from Moldova and Dr Malgorzata Nodzynska from Poland). It is also interesting that the plenary reports covered all three essential areas of science education - chemistry, physics, biology.
The topics of the reports were various, mainly in various fields of science and technology education. It is important that the participants were active, there were intense discussions and sharing of experiences. All participants acknowledged that education in a pandemic environment is significantly restricted. This applies in particular to various non-formal education activities, or activities that take place outside the regular classroom (e.g. various project activities). 
Presentations were also made on the second day of the conference. Dr. Rita Makarskaitė-Petkevičienė (Vilnius University) moderated four presentations. Traditionally, on the second day of the conference, practical seminars were organized for all conference participants. A similar goal was set at this conference - to make all reports useful for all professionals at all levels of education. 
Most conference reports were presented in the form of articles and published in the conference proceedings. One can find full texts in the database at: https://oaji.net/journal-archive-stats.html?number=1984&year=2021&issue=18298 It is tentatively scheduled that the 28th Conference will take place on April 29-30, 2022, also remotely.

COMAT started in 2010 so the last year we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the conference and also the 20th anniversary of COMTES FHT Inc. The conference was organized by traditional tandem COMTES FHT Inc. and TANGER Ltd. There were big plans to celebrate these anniversaries with adequate dignity. However, the COVID-19 has changed it, as well as many other things and we ended up with a significantly reduced event. Although the situation was not positive, we highly appreciated interest of participants from Europe and Asia. We received many papers for publication in proceedings out of which 67 were selected for the proceedings publication. Due to an uncertain situation and almost a global lock-down it took much longer to finalize the review process this time. We would like to thank very much to reviewers and authors for their comments and papers corrections. Anyway, we are finally here and we hope the papers presented in the proceedings will be interesting for all readers. We are looking forward to seeing you all personally at COMAT 2022.

Low-cost sensors often exhibit non-linear responses to air pollutants and their signals may be affected by the presence of multiple compounds making their calibration challenging. We investigate different approaches for the field calibration of an AQ monitoring device named ENSENSIA, developed in the Institute of Chemical Engineering Sciences in Greece. The present study focuses on the measurements of two of the most important pollutants measured by ENSENSIA: NO2 and O3. The measurement site is located in the center of Patras, the third biggest city in Greece. Reference instrumentation used for regulatory purposes by the Region of Western Greece was used as the evaluation standard. The sensors were installed for two years at the same locations. Measurements from the first year (2021) from seven ENSENSIA sensors (NO2, NO, O3, CO, PM2.5, temperature and relative humidity) were used to train several Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. The resulting calibration algorithms were assessed using data from the second year (2022). The Random Forest algorithm exhibited the best performance in correcting O3 and NO2. For NO2 the mean error was reduced from 9.4 ppb to 3 ppb, whilst R2 improved from 0.22 to 0.86. Similar results were obtained for O3, wherein the mean error was reduced from 13 to 4.3 ppb and R2 increased from 0.52 to 0.69. The Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) also showed good performance in correcting the measurements of the two pollutants.",Atmosphere,2023.0,5,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/14/2/368/pdf?version=1676293060', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/atmos14020368?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos14020368, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

53370818d16213cd80a67a00a86899e2adbcc8d3,Understanding energy transitions,"Transitions to cleaner, renewable energy are at the heart ofpolicies in many countries. The focus on renewables has, ifanything, become greater recently as uncertainty growsabout the viability and acceptability of alternatives toachieve low-carbon growth, including nuclear power andcarbon capture and storage (REN21 2010). The Fukushimaaccident has forced many governments to rethink theirnuclear energy plans—Japan has just shutdown their lastnuclear power plant, and Germany announced last year itwill be nuclear free by 2022. But transitions away fromfossil fuel-based energy systems have proven slow despitethe potential of renewable energy sources and advancingtechnologies to utilize them.Recent research in ‘Transitions Studies’ argues thattransitions will not be a technological ﬁx but will requiresome combination of economic, political, institutional andsocio-cultural changes (Berkhout et al. 2009; Cohen et al.2010; Stephens et al. 2008). Without doubt, these transi-tions must be guided by an ethics that brings togethertechnology and sustainability. In the introductory messageto this special issue, Jean-Louis Armand calls for such anethic of long-range responsibility—one that is properlyembedded in sustainability science as a guide for ourfuture.In response to this complex issue, Sustainability Sciencehas organized a special issue on two related themes—thecosts of mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions andthe diffusion of clean energy technologies. The ﬁrst fourpapers model abatement costs for world regions andsectors with a focus on medium term GHG emissiontargets (2020 and 2030)—a key step in stabilizing long-term climate change under the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These studiesﬁnd that transitions toward a low-carbon society are notan extension of the current trends, and far greater GHGreductions—both on national and global scales—arerequired in the mid-term. A further ﬁve papers explore thebarriers and opportunities of energy transitions on theground, using transition management theories to explainempirical cases in India, Japan, Malaysia and the UnitedStates.Hanaoka and Kainuma conduct a comparison of GHGmarginal abatement cost (MAC) curves from 0 to200 US $/tCO",Sustainability Science,2012.0,45,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11625-012-0173-5.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s11625-012-0173-5?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-012-0173-5, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Observing strategies for this survey are being actively investigated, and the science capabilities can be best forecasted on the basis of simulated strategies from the LSST Operations Simulator (OpSim). OpSim simulates a stochastic realization of the sequence of LSST pointings over the survey duration, and is based on a model of the observatory (including telescope) and historical data of observational conditions. OpSim outputs contain a record of each simulated pointing of the survey along with a complete characterization of the pointing in terms of observing conditions, and some useful quantities derived from the characteristics of the pointing. Thus, each record can be efficiently used to derive the properties of observations of all astrophysical sources found in that pointing. However, in order to obtain the time series of observations (light curves) of a set of sources, it is often more convenient to compute all observations of an astrophysical source, and iterate over sources. In this document, we describe the open source python package OpSimSummary, which allows for a convenient reordering. The objectives of this package are to provide users with an Application Programming Interface for accessing all such observations and summarizing this information in the form of intermediate data products usable by third party software such as SNANA, thereby also bridging the gap between official LSST products and preexisting simulation codes.",Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series,2019.0,6,"{'url': 'https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab72f2/pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02887, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e043ac75246ac3375bbf7d6fb41b86c0008a9fcd,Towards understanding Deccan volcanism,"Large igneous provinces (LIPs) represent some of the greatest volcanic events in Earth history with significant impacts on ecosystems, including mass extinctions. However, some fundamental questions related to the eruption rate, eruption style, and vent locations for LIP lava flows remain unanswered. In this review, we use the Cretaceous–Paleogene Deccan Traps as an archetype to address these questions because they are one of the best-preserved large continental flood basalt provinces. We describe the volcanological features of the Deccan flows and the potential temporal and regional variations as well as the spatial characteristics of potential feeder dikes. Along with estimates of mean long-term eruption rates for individual Deccan lavas from paleomagnetism and Hg proxy records of ∼50–250 km3/year (erupting for tens to hundreds of years), the Deccan volcanic characteristics suggest aunified conceptual model for eruption of voluminous (>1,000 km3) LIP lavas with large spatial extent (>40,000 km2). We conclude by highlighting a few key open questions and challenges that can help improve our understanding of how the Deccan flows, as well as LIP flows in general, erupted and the mechanisms by which the lavas may have flowed over distances up to 1,000 km. ▪ The Deccan Traps are an archetype for addressing fundamental volcanological questions related to eruption rate, eruption style, and vent locations for large igneous province lava flows. ▪ Deccan subprovinces likely evolved as separate volcanic systems; thus, long-distance/interprovince flow correlations must be carefully assessed. ▪ The earliest eruptions came through the Narmada-Tapi rift zone followed by the establishment of a separate magmatic plumbing system by mantle plume–associated magmas. ▪ Typical Deccan eruption rates were ∼50–250 km3/year of lava. Individual eruptions lasted for a few hundred to 1,000 years and were separated by hiatuses of 3,000–6,000 years. ▪ The conspicuous absence of dikes in the Central Deccan region strongly implies long-distance surface transport of lavas in the form of flows hundreds of kilometers long.

0b3add0c38e6d5f6272950b0bcdb1e7c91cb360f,A structural equation model looking at student’s participatory behavior and their success in Calculus I,"BackgroundGovernment projections in the USA indicate that the country will need a million more science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates above and beyond those already projected by the year 2022. Of crucial importance to the STEM pipeline is success in Calculus I, without which continuation in a STEM major is not possible. The STEM community at large, and mathematics instructors specifically, need to understand factors that influence and promote success in order to mitigate the alarming attrition trend. Previous work in this area has defined success singularly in terms of grades or persistence; however, these definitions are somewhat limiting and neglect the possible mediating effects of affective constructs like confidence, mindset, and enjoyment on the aforementioned markers of success. Using structural equation modeling, this paper explored the effect of participation on grades in freshman college calculus and investigated whether these effects were mediated by affective variables.ResultsResults indicated that participation had no significant direct effect on any of the success components in the final model—a finding that was not only counterintuitive but actually contradicted previous research done on this data. Participation was however highly correlated with two other exogenous variables indicating it would be inappropriate to dismiss it as being unrelated to success. Furthermore, the results suggested a cluster of affective success components and an achievement component with confidence being the intermediary between the two.ConclusionsThis paper extends upon previous work with this data set in which the effect of participatory behaviors on success was investigated wherein success was measured singularly with expected course grade and affective components of success were not considered. The limited explanatory power of the model, coupled with the seemingly contradictory results, indicates that participatory behaviors alone might be insufficient to capture the complexity of the success response variable.",International Journal of STEM Education,2017.0,7,"{'url': 'https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40594-017-0093-0', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6310372, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6864b291d59bf34a9ebcc4cea8b0d65a4084ae45,Mentorship at a distance.,"The year is 2022. It is a warm summer day in Boston, and Naomi, an incoming graduate student, sits in a cafe waiting for two colleagues who have greatly influenced her career—although they've never met in person. It was back in 2020 when Naomi, then an undergraduate at Howard University, spent a summer working virtually with Matthias, a postdoc, and Maha, the lab principal investigator, through a Harvard University internship program. Now that the world has managed COVID-19, they are excited to finally meet face-to-face and reflect on that summer experience.



> “With a little work, we formed a lasting bond.” 

NAOMI: I remember that day in March 2020 when everything seemed to unravel. I was told to evacuate my campus and that classes would be virtual for the indefinite future. While many of my peers' summer research opportunities were canceled, I was lucky that the Harvard summer internship was scheduled to continue virtually. But I wondered how I would learn a completely new topic and research style from 3000 kilometers and two time zones away. How would I form a relationship with my mentors?

MATTHIAS: Both Maha and I had doubts about the virtual internship format. I had never mentored a student completely remotely, and I knew you had never done this type of research before. I counted on Maha's experience mentoring students and her optimism that we would make it work.

NAOMI: The biggest challenge for me was not knowing whether I was on track. If we had been working together in person, it would have been easy to casually touch base and get gentle nudges in the right direction when I needed them. But I was too nervous to ask basic questions over video calls and chat, so I relied on trial and error and online tutorials. Then, when I presented my work to you, I was disappointed to learn that the model I had worked on for 2 weeks was completely wrong.

MAHA: I remember that moment well. It became clear then that we needed to reset our expectations and how we communicated. I urged you to use chat liberally and reach out for more frequent short check-ins. As the days rolled on, you seemed to become more at ease asking for help.

NAOMI: It certainly helped that you were present and responsive via telephone calls and chat. I also learned the importance of making my concerns heard. And when we began to speak more often, I got to see another side of your lives. I never expected to have video calls with Matthias while he was at the playground with his kids!

MATTHIAS: Me neither! Do you remember when my daughter poured water on my laptop? It delayed me terribly in sending over a key figure for your final presentation. I was balancing so much at the time and yet desperately wanted to be there when you needed me.

NAOMI: Yes, that wasn't the smoothest moment—but ultimately it only strengthened our relationship. Seeing your struggles with working from home helped me realize that we are all human, navigating through a difficult time together.

MATTHIAS: I enjoyed connecting with you informally; it felt very genuine. It also offered an opportunity to reflect on what kind of mentor I want to be in the “real” world. I hope to carry that forward with me.

MAHA: Losing the connection with mentees was among the hardest aspects of the quarantine for me professionally. Shifting to a more relaxed communication style really helped. It also reinforced my belief that science and scientists should be less aloof and more welcoming, especially to aspiring scientists early in their careers.

NAOMI: The virtual environment made it hard to connect at times—but with a little work, we formed a lasting bond.",Science,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1126/science.370.6515.494', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1126/science.370.6515.494?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1126/science.370.6515.494, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In addition, the study seeks to investigate the potential relationships between the origin and nationality of academic publishers and the geography of editors-in-chief. Design/methodology/approach The analysis involves 11,915 journals listed in Web of Science’s Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE). These journals employ 15,795 scholars as editors-in-chief. The geographical locations of the institutions the editors-in-chief are affiliated with were identified; then, the data were aggregated at the country level. Findings The results show that most editors-in-chief are located in countries of the Anglosphere, primarily the United States and the United Kingdom. In addition, most academic publishers and professional organizations that publish academic journals were found to be based in the United States and the United Kingdom, where most editors-in-chief are also based. Research limitations The analysis involves journals indexed in the Web of Science’s SCIE/SSCI databases, which are demonstrably biased toward the English language. Furthermore, the study only takes a snapshot of the geography of editors-in-chief for the year 2022, but it does not investigate trends.

The words ""nutrition"" and ""pharmaceutical"" are combined to form the phrase ""nutraceutical."" Nutraceuticals are foods or dietary components that have an important role in regulating and sustaining normal physiological function in humans. For the treatment of dysmenorrhoea, a variety of pharmacological medications are available, however, they all have significant side effects. Dietary supplements and lifestyle management, on the other hand, were found to have a major influence on the occurrence and control of dysmenorrhea.



The objective of this paper is to study a comprehensive review of the dietary and nutritional supplements with special emphasis on dysmenorrhea. This paper focuses on understanding and interpreting the details of menstrual pain and its effective nutritional diet that can be used as a treatment for avoiding menstrual discomfort.



The selection of data has been done by studying a combination of various research and review papers from different databases like PubMed, NCBI, Science Direct, WHO, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from the year 2000-2022.



Based on various papers and literature reviews, we have concluded about various dietary supplements and herbs that can be used to avoid pain during mensuration followed by its all-daily requirement of nutrition on different age groups and efficacy of treatments.



According to current evidence, young women should be instructed in the proper use of dietary supplements, nutrition, and vitamins, as well as the inclusion of effective diet and lifestyle changes such as exercise and a well-balanced diet with adequate nutrition, as these are likely to reduce the negative effects of dysmenorrhea.

   The First2 Network’s Immersion program at Fairmont State University provides a college bridge experience for incoming students in science, technology and engineering and math (STEM). The First2 Network’s goal is to guide and assist rural, first-generation, and other underrepresented STEM college students. The summer immersion bridge experience immerses students into college life. Students stay in dorms and learn what it’s like to be away from home while engaging in a program which includes real research projects in collaboration with professors and peer mentors, introductions to campus resources, and social events. This program helps students get acclimated to college, making it an easier adjustment. The immersive experience also provides connections and a safe space that students can go to when they have questions or need help. 
    As students who attended the immersive program during the summer of 2022, we can say that it helped us greatly. Not only did we learn about all the resources on campus, but we got real lab experience. We were lab partners conducting analytical chemistry research on lead in paint. We performed all the lab work with supervision and guidance from chemistry professors and lab assistants. At the end of the 2 weeks, we presented our research to students, faculty, and family members. This immersion program was resume and experience building, that helped us make connections with our peers that a have persisted throughout our first year.",Proceedings of the West Virginia Academy of Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://pwvas.org/index.php/pwvas/article/download/1001/875', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.55632/pwvas.v95i2.1001?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.55632/pwvas.v95i2.1001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In this study Gaussian equations modelled by Matlab program to state the effect of pollutant NO2 gas on area around Durra refinery, this program also evaluate some elements such as wind and stability and its effect on stacks height. Data used in this study is the amount of fuel oil and fuel gas burn inside refinery at a year 2017. Hourly April month data chosen as a case study because it’s unsteady month. After evaluate emission rate of the all fuel and calculate exit velocity from stack (consider all refinery unit is a point), effective height resulted. Effective height is test with other atmospheric element and with stability, and there is direct relation with unstable turner classes. After Gaussian model implemented results show that most pollutant area from pollutant of NO2 is Al-Jadriyah and Al-Karada area, this area is about 3-5 kilometer from the refinery point. The wind direction domain is from the south to south-east, thus most flow is to north, north-west and the pollutant level of NO2 is over the national ambient air quality standard in this area. Keyword: NO2 concentration, stability, air pollution, April month, emission rate. Introduction: Power generation plants and refinery produce varying emissions to the surrounding atmosphere that may adversely impact air quality and cause air pollution in the vicinity regions . Through Combustion of fossil fuels atmospheric nitrogen and any nitrogen in the fuel will converts into its oxides, mainly nitric oxide (NO) and with small amounts (5–10%) of NO2. NO slowly oxidizes to NO2 in the atmosphere . Nitrogen oxides, NOx are the term used to describe the sum of NO, NO2 and other oxides of nitrogen; all these play a major role in the formation of ozone, particulate matter, and acid rain. Long-term exposures to NO2 may lead to increase susceptibility to respiratory infection and may cause permanent alterations in the lung . Usually NO2 in the atmosphere comes from two sources, either directly from emission sources (primary pollutant) or from chemical reactions in the atmosphere . Nitrogen monoxide (NO), in turn, is converted to NO2 by reactions with proxy radicals (RO2) or O3. Nitrogen dioxide is then photolysis in the atmosphere, and the released atomic oxygen combines with molecule O2 to form O3, This gas considers one of gases emitted from flues . Flow rate of Emissions are necessary to determine transfer Contaminants, Where Know the source location will allow us to calculate concentration at a particular region using dispersion model . Inhalation of NO2 by children increases their risk of respiratory infection and may lead to poorer lung function in later life. Recent epidemiological studies have shown an association between ambient NO2 exposure and increases in daily mortality and hospital admissions for respiratory disease. NO2 has also been shown to potentiate the effects of exposure to other known irritants, such as ozone and respirable particles . Animal and human experimental studies indicate that NO2 at short-term concentrations exceeding 200μg/m (one hour) is a toxic gas with significant health effects. Animal toxicological studies also suggest that long-term exposure to NO2 at concentrations above current ambient concentrations has adverse effects .

The study was focus on the factors affecting the pollutant NO2 concentration gas overall. For this purpose the program has built up for simulated arithmetic algorithms, also for precision and ease in the use of equations considered. Site Durra Refinery is the main refinery of Ministry of oil Midland Refineries Company (MRC) in Iraq. It is located on the western side of the Tigris River and south-west of Baghdad city, about few kilometers from the city center, it is flat ground. Refinery has Dimensions length 1620 m and width of 860m. From east bounded with small liquid gas filling plant, and the Imam Hassan neighborhood, also from the west and south-west the university district, the residence of employer’s borders of the refinery. The highway is located on the east, south-east and south sides. Finally, on the northern side, a small flat area extends across the Tigris River; consider one of the largest cities in Baghdad province known as Karada 9 Fig. 1. When refinery builds in 1960 it’s located outside the Baghdad city but the large urban expansion will made the refinery inside the Baghdad city. Figure 1.

Commercially produced videos are commonly used by medical students but are rarely integrated into curricula. Objective Our goal was to examine student engagement with medical education videos incorporated into a preclinical Cardiovascular Systems course. Methods Students who took the first-year 8-week Cardiovascular Systems course in 2019 and 2020 were included in the study. Videos from Osmosis were recommended to be watched before live sessions throughout the course. Video use was monitored through dashboards, and course credit was given for watching videos. All students were emailed electronic surveys after the final exam asking about the course’s blended learning experience and use of videos. Osmosis usage data for number of video views, multiple choice questions, and flashcards were extracted from Osmosis dashboards. Results Overall, 232/359 (64.6%) students completed surveys, with rates by class of 81/154 (52.6%) for MD Class of 2022, 39/50 (78%) for MD/MPH Class of 2022, and 112/155 (72.3%) for MD Class of 2023. Osmosis dashboard data were available for all 359 students. All students received the full credit offered for Osmosis engagement, and learning analytics demonstrated regular usage of videos and other digital platform features. Survey responses indicated that most students found Osmosis videos to be helpful for learning (204/232, 87.9%; P=.001) and preferred Osmosis videos to the traditional lecture format (134/232, 57.8%; P<.001). Conclusions Commercial medical education videos may enhance curriculum with low faculty effort and improve students’ learning experiences. Findings from our experience at one medical school can guide the effective use of supplemental digital resources for learning, and related evaluation and research.",JMIR Medical Education,2021.0,15,"{'url': 'https://mededu.jmir.org/2021/4/e27441/PDF', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8532015, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2150fe09f1d5cc67a55b17254ce981ef03244198,Booming undergraduate enrollments,"2015 December • Vol. 6 • No. 4 acm Inroads 105 In many colleges and universities across the country, computer science classes are bursting at the seams! According to Computing Research Association (CRA)’s Taulbee Survey, the number of newly declared computer science (CS) and computer engineering (CE) majors at more than 100 research universities surveyed reached an all-time high two years ago (the most recent data available), and has undoubtedly increased further since then. The Taulbee Survey and ACM’s annual Survey of Non-Doctoral-Granting Departments in Computing both indicate an anticipated growth in enrollment of between 15 and 20 percent annually. At my own university—the University of Massachusetts Amherst—the number of computer science majors is now approaching twice its previous high. We’ve read in the popular press that introductory computing has become the most popular course on a number of campuses. At the CRA’s Snowbird conference last year, CS leaders debated whether this dramatic increase of interest is a wave that will crest and recede, or a “sea change” representing a new norm. The answer to this important question involves at least three important converging trends. Certainly, the job market for newly minted CS/CE majors appears excellent. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that more than half of the new jobs in 2012 through 2022, across all of STEM, will be in computer occupations. And starting salaries for those with CS/CE bachelor’s degrees have consistently been among the highest across all majors. There’s also a tangible sense of excitement and opportunity among our majors about their careers and the impact of their work. But I think that the bright prospects for students in our traditional computer science programs are a piece of the picture, and why I believe we’ll be seeing a “sea change” rather than a wave. To this point, a second trend we’re seeing is that, increasingly, computing has infused myriad industry sectors and academic disciplines far beyond the tech sector. Jeanette Wing, a predecessor of mine as Assistant Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), spoke eloquently about the need for “computational thinking” in many disciplines.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) had been looking for another body to take over the burden of funding and running the Puerto Rican observatory ever since a 2006 review suggested the agency ramp down its funding to free up money for newer projects. Astronomers, planetary scientists, and atmospheric physicists all use the 55-year-old, 305-meter radio dish but its importance has waned. NSF now spends about $8 million a year to run Arecibo, with NASA pitching in another $3.6 million.

Forests strongly modify the accumulation, metamorphism and melting of snow in midlatitude and high-latitude regions. Recently, snow routines in hydrological and land surface models were improved to incorporate more accurate representations of forest snow processes, but model intercomparison projects have identified deficiencies, partly due to incomplete knowledge of the processes controlling snow cover in forests. The Snow Under Forest (SnoUF) project was initiated to enhance knowledge of the complex interactions between snow and vegetation. Two field campaigns, during the winters 2016–2017 and 2017–2018, were conducted in a coniferous forest bordering the snow study at Col de Porte (1325 m a.s.l., French Alps) to document the snow accumulation and ablation processes. This paper presents the field site, the instrumentation and the collection and postprocessing methods. The observations include distributed forest characteristics (tree inventory, lidar measurements of forest structure, subcanopy hemispherical photographs), meteorology (automatic weather station and an array of radiometers), snow cover and depth (snow pole transect and laser scan) and snow interception by the canopy during precipitation events. The weather station installed under dense canopy during the first campaign has been maintained since then and has provided continuous measurements throughout the year since 2018. Data are publicly available from the repository of the Observatoire des Sciences de l'Univers de Grenoble (OSUG) data center at https://doi.org/10.17178/SNOUF.2022 (Sicart et al., 2022).

5c78eda615651f2796845c8b7ea41423e44d5120,African Rangelands and Pastoralism in a changing continent: Perspectives and Opportunities,"iii Eighty-five years ago, Africa was described as a land of promise because it provided an immense opportunity for maximum return in the minimum time (Olaniyan 2000). It was treated this way because it was considered more for its deposits of natural wealth and less for its potential for settlement or as a destination market for goods and services produced in Europe and elsewhere (Le Clair 1937). For over 50 years, this narrative held ground but in the last 20 years, perception has shifted with Africa becoming a destination market and a growth opportunity creator, whilst holding ground as a resource provider (Sy 2016). These externally driven perceptions are shifting how key natural resources on the continent are viewed, used and managed. Accordingly, contestations are emerging especially around the environmental–demographic realities. This is because of the emphasis currently placed on continuous economic growth requiring more resource inputs. This will ultimately lead to increased natural resources conflict (Abbink 2018). The exploitative narrative over Africa had become pervasive with respect to the categorisation and valuation of its natural resources. Accordingly, despite covering 43% of the continent’s land surface, rangelands have been subjected to a relatively negative narrative being described as undeveloped areas (Kratli 2010), and centers of degradation, erosion, desertification, droughts, famine and conflict (Martínez-Valderrama and Ibáñez 2023; Twinomuhangi et al. 2023). Such negative narratives influenced the kinds of intervention in rangelands, confining these large swaths of land to conservation areas such as national parks and game reserves (Jones 2006; Cavanagh et al. 2020), constraining livestock to species such as goats (Doro 2023), and expropriating lands from the Indigenous Peoples (Homewood et al. 2009; Guyo 2017). However, more recently, ecologists and economists have revisited the place of rangelands in the continent to provide alternative perspectives on the importance of these natural resources (Vetter 2013). Current evidence counteracts previous notions that African rangelands and pastoralism are unproductive and mismanaged systems (Liniger and Studer 2019). The contribution of rangelands to the livelihoods of African people is considerable and diverse. Most of the continent’s livestock providing diverse products including meat and milk produced from the rangelands (Holechek et al. 2017). Additionally, rangelands are increasingly recognised for their diverse role in the provision of ecosystem services (Ruvuga et al. 2019; Gatwaza and Wang 2023), including carbon sequestration (Denboba 2022) and other valuable provisions. As the population in Africa has grown rapidly over the last three decades and is projected to reach 2.5 billion people by 2050, food demand has also grown and will continue to rise (Dorin 2017). Rangelands have often been the frontiers for agricultural expansion and urban development, and land use conversion pressure is higher in existing rangelands, often with high population densities (Schlecht et al. 2020). Such patterns of land use change are causing inflexibility and restricting livestock mobility in traditional rangeland use centred around livestock herding (Feldt et al. 2020). Owing to these pressures, land tenure and land use policy, including land privatisation (Godde et al. 2020), sedentarisation, and conversion to other land uses, have become increasingly prevalent in the rangelands (Byakagaba et al. 2018). These changes are reorienting the livelihoods of the people domiciled in many African rangeland areas. Increasing global connections via trade and investment are leading to improved better infrastructure and increased accessibility of previously remote rangelands, thereby contributing to large-scale transformations of the traditional territories of rangeland-based people (Lind et al. 2020). Following the increasing global recognition of the momentous dynamics that are globally reshaping rangelands and biodiversity, the Government of Mongolia proposed in 2019 that the United Nations (UN) declare an International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists (IYRP) in 2026. This proposal was subsequently endorsed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and approved by the United Nations General Assembly on 15 March 2022. The intention of celebrating the IYRP is to raise the profile of rangelands and pastoral societies worldwide and to enhance recognition of their valuable contribution to the economy, environment, society, and culture at a the local, national, and global level. Under the global IYRP coalition, African researchers decided to develop a special issue of the African Journal of Range & Forage Science to provide evidence on diverse topical issues converging around the theme rangelands and pastoralism in a changing continent. This African-led special issue presents emerging evidence for a regional perspective of dynamics that are reshaping the perception, valuation, development, and management of the continent’s rangelands.",African Journal of Range &amp; Forage Science,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.2989/10220119.2023.2182070?needAccess=true&role=button', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2989/10220119.2023.2182070?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2023.2182070, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The Coral Triangle and Southeast Asia are recognized as a worldwide hotspot of seagrass species and habitats, encompassing 10-21 species of seagrass in every na-tion, although the study, understanding, and quantity of publications on seagrass eco-systems are rather limited in the region, including Malaysia. Malaysia contains 18 seagrass species from three families, which occupy 16.8 km2of coastal area, where the study and discovery of seagrass species and meadows began in 1904 with the re-port of Beccari. All of the published papers reviewed reported on Malaysian seagrass-related research, which was divided into nine topic groups: biology and distribution, carbon sequestration, fauna, remote sensing, impact and pollution genetic study, res-toration, microbiological investigation, and others. The extensive study of the seagrass ecosystem began in 1993, and we have identified 183 published papers from Scopus, 141 publications from Web of Science, and 42 from Google Scholar. However, the average trend of the number of publications from 1993 to 1999 was 0.71 ± 0.36, while from 2000 to 2022 was 7.70 ± 1.16 followed by the average trend of the yearly number of publications was 6.78 ± 1.08. The highest number of publications was found on faunal categories (43.17%), followed by biology and distribution (21.85%).

b5184eb3226c800e357c03ed8a56d01404dedf74,From GE to ESP: technology of educational work with professional authentic foreign language materials for junior medical students,"Introduction. Research competencies, including the skills of working with professional foreign language literature, various authentic sources, the ability to work with specialized scientific databases forms the basis of modern professional training of medical students. Aim. Description of the author's model of working with authentic foreign language materials for junior medical students and justification of the technology of organizing educational activities using specially selected authentic materials at the stage of the transition from general foreign language disciplines to professional communication. The subject of the study was the stage of transition from the general course of a foreign (English) language (GE) to a professional one (ESP). Materials and methods. The research is based on the cascade principle of the formation of foreign language competencies of medical students. This principle presupposes the systematization and practical application of general language knowledge, on the basis of which professionally significant communication skills are formed. The methods of analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, comparative studies were used, which made it possible to assess the relationship between the system of professional medical education and the use of authentic foreign language materials in this process. The empirical study was implemented by integrating professional questionnaires (needs analysis) [24] into D. Kirkpatrick's four-type model for evaluating the effectiveness of training during the transition from GE to ESP at the beginning and at the end of training. The study was conducted during one academic year (September 2022 – June 2023) in classes in the disciplines ""Foreign language (General English)"" and ""English for professional communication (ESP/EAP)"" at the Faculty of Medical Science (N. V. Sklifosovsky Institute of Clinical Medicine, Sechenov University). The respondents of the study were 80 medical students of junior courses (1st and 2nd year students) of the level of English proficiency ""Intermediate"" (B1+) and ""Upper-Intermediate"" (B2+). Results. The results of the study showed that medical students from the study group reacted positively to the introduction of professional authentic foreign language materials into the educational process. The developed model of designing educational work allowed to form and put into practice the technologies of the educational process relevant to the professional field of medicine, which increases not only the foreign language communication of students, but also their professional competencies.

4a9a86793168913cdc8e5aee859176edfa020850,Civic Homeland Security Culture: A Poll Study Approach and the Example of Pennsylvania,"COVID-19 response experience around the world has demonstrated that it is indispensable to understand the public understanding of, and needs during, risk, hazards, and crisis in public policy, in particular related to the security of society as a whole. The ultimate goal of homeland security and broader civil (or sometimes referred to as societal) security alike, as well as of related security science research, is to accomplish resilient societies through a culture of preparedness. Civic security culture is a necessary ingredient to such a culture of preparedness. The security culture perspective also helps understand how a resilient society and nation can be fostered while enhancing democratic values. This chapter discusses civic security culture (different, for example, from elite culture, first responder culture, agency culture, organizational culture, or safety culture) using the example of U.S. homeland security. Specifically, employing and extrapolating from the results of a multi-year Pennsylvania representative opinion poll study, it demonstrates how to investigate civic homeland security culture empirically and portrays a picture of such culture in a large U.S. state that appears to allow for some reasonable generalizations. In its conclusion, the chapter also indicates how such study of security culture can help assess homeland and/or civil security policy and governance, identify gaps, and recommend improvements. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Handbook of Security Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3056&context=publication', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/978-3-319-51761-2_39-1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-51761-2_39-1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0a47217c05cbec360a41ac3ad3845f76b9f0adab,Automating Construction of Machine Learning Models With Clinical Big Data: Proposal Rationale and Methods,"Background To improve health outcomes and cut health care costs, we often need to conduct prediction/classification using large clinical datasets (aka, clinical big data), for example, to identify high-risk patients for preventive interventions. Machine learning has been proposed as a key technology for doing this. Machine learning has won most data science competitions and could support many clinical activities, yet only 15% of hospitals use it for even limited purposes. Despite familiarity with data, health care researchers often lack machine learning expertise to directly use clinical big data, creating a hurdle in realizing value from their data. Health care researchers can work with data scientists with deep machine learning knowledge, but it takes time and effort for both parties to communicate effectively. Facing a shortage in the United States of data scientists and hiring competition from companies with deep pockets, health care systems have difficulty recruiting data scientists. Building and generalizing a machine learning model often requires hundreds to thousands of manual iterations by data scientists to select the following: (1) hyper-parameter values and complex algorithms that greatly affect model accuracy and (2) operators and periods for temporally aggregating clinical attributes (eg, whether a patient’s weight kept rising in the past year). This process becomes infeasible with limited budgets. Objective This study’s goal is to enable health care researchers to directly use clinical big data, make machine learning feasible with limited budgets and data scientist resources, and realize value from data. Methods This study will allow us to achieve the following: (1) finish developing the new software, Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML), to automate model selection for machine learning with clinical big data and validate Auto-ML on seven benchmark modeling problems of clinical importance; (2) apply Auto-ML and novel methodology to two new modeling problems crucial for care management allocation and pilot one model with care managers; and (3) perform simulations to estimate the impact of adopting Auto-ML on US patient outcomes. Results We are currently writing Auto-ML’s design document. We intend to finish our study by around the year 2022. Conclusions Auto-ML will generalize to various clinical prediction/classification problems. With minimal help from data scientists, health care researchers can use Auto-ML to quickly build high-quality models. This will boost wider use of machine learning in health care and improve patient outcomes.",JMIR Research Protocols,2017.0,46,"{'url': 'https://www.researchprotocols.org/2017/8/e175/PDF', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5596298, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The living status of the people is increasing day by day which leads to increase in paying capacity. Among non-vegetarian food chicken is widely accepted having no religious foundation which has lead to boom in poultry industry in last 2-3 decades. Egg production has increased from 50.70 billion (2006-07) to 66.45 billion (2011-12). As per the nineteenth livestock census we are having 729.21 million poultry population. (DAHD, 2016-17). India ranks third in egg and fourth in chicken production in the world. Within last twenty five year duration the egg production has gone up to 70 billion from few millions and the broiler production has gone to 3.8 million tones from nowhere. The annual growth rate of broiler chicken production is 10-12%. The per capita egg consumption has gone up from 30 to 68 and the chicken meat from 400 gm to 2.5 kg.

e34885bbe3e124d5bf4c5a7c0c12c1344fdffea8,Improving the LSST dithering pattern and cadence for dark energy studies,"The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will explore the entire southern sky over 10 years starting in 2022 with unprecedented depth and time sampling in six filters, ugrizy. Artificial power on the scale of the 3.5 deg LSST field-of-view will contaminate measurements of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), which fall at the same angular scale at redshift z ~ 1. Using the HEALPix framework, we demonstrate the impact of an “un- dithered” survey, in which 17% of each LSST field-of-view is overlapped by neighboring observations, generating a honeycomb pattern of strongly varying survey depth and significant artificial power on BAO angular scales. We find that adopting large dithers (i.e., telescope pointing o sets) of amplitude close to the LSST field-of-view radius reduces artificial structure in the galaxy distribution by a factor of ~10. We propose an observing strategy utilizing large dithers within the main survey and minimal dithers for the LSST Deep Drilling Fields. We show that applying various magnitude cutos can further increase survey uniformity. We find that a magnitude cut of r < 27:3 removes significant spurious power from the angular power spectrum with a minimal reduction in the total number of observed galaxies over the ten-year LSST run. We also determine the effectiveness of the observing strategy for Type Ia SNe and predict that the main survey will contribute ~100,000 Type Ia SNe. We propose a concentrated survey where LSST observes one-third of its main survey area each year, increasing the number of main survey Type Ia SNe by a factor of ~1.5, while still enabling the successful pursuit of other science drivers.",Astronomical Telescopes and Instrumentation,2014.0,10,"{'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.04733', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04733, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ba19628056a23956de7403e17673cb84af72adbe,Author reply to Weaving et al.: comment on: ‘A contemporary multi-modal mechanical approach to training monitoring in elite professional soccer: a mathematical problem?’,"Dear Editor, We thank the authors of this particular paper for their constructive comments on our manuscript first published within Science and Medicine in football in 2017 (Owen et al. 2017) and welcome the opportunity to address some of the points raised. Overall, we agree with the points made and we welcome further debate within this research area. Furthermore, we take great satisfaction from the discussion the manuscript has caused within the practical and academic communities across professional team sport codes. We also hope these debates will allow for the opportunity for future research within other team sport codes across this multi-modal approach to monitoring. The main concerns raised by Weaving et al. (2020) relate to the collinearity of specific external loading measures that are provided from GPS micro sensor technology within the practical setting daily. We do not disagree with the comments on this fact; indeed, extensive reviews and additional manuscripts across the training load literature have reported on this issue across the preceding three-year period post the initial publication of the manuscript into multi-modal models in 2017. Additionally, while practically through mediums like social media and podcasts, there may have been an increase in interest within the topic area; academically, one additional research manuscript has been published in this area (Owen et al. 2019), highlighting the need for increased debate and refinement of the multi-modal approach originally published in 2017. This research, we hope, will incorporate the specific statistical requirements that may reduce the highlighted collinearity within the original model proposed by Owen and colleagues in 2017. It should be noted by academics that previous literature has reported on the disconnect between practitioners and academics with respect to embedded sports science research (Malone et al. 2019). The research reported that while research collaborations were mainly formed to improve team performance, academics ranked journal articles with increased importance, while practitioners rated one-to-one communication as more preferential. Furthermore, potential barriers were found in terms of staff buy-in, with practitioners reporting a preference for ‘fast’ type research. Overall, practitioners preferred ‘fast’ informal research dissemination compared to the ‘slow’ quality control approach of academics. The above highlights how research over time can improve any methodological issues associated with specific measures, but also how practitioners are concerned with the here and now, and getting staff buy-in through open communication channels with backroom teams and management within a high-performance setting. From its inception, the multi-modal approach was created to condense down specific external loading reports for applied practitioners into two key variables of volume and intensity represented by specific percentage values, in order to allow for a more simplistic process of external load dissemination between performance staff and technical staff within soccer. We acknowledge, however, that not all models are without limitations, based on additional research within the area of ratios, that these data within the multi-model model may mathematically scale across specific players depending on their performance within the training and match-play (Lolli et al. 2018). However, the main purpose of the creation of the external training load measures within the model was to provide an approach to practitioners that would engage technical staff of elite sporting organisations who anecdotally have limited interest in engaging with sport science professionals due to the ever-increasing data within the applied field. We feel that since the model’s inception it has allowed for increased communication between staff members within high-performance teams across multiple sporting codes based. However, we acknowledge that specific improvements are required to the model, based on the constructive feedback from Weaving et al. (2020). The original model (Owen et al. 2017) did not include a PCA but it should be noted that the original paper was developed to show-case a concept for practitioners with respect to external training load analysis. It was expected that this model would be modified by readers to fit their contextual environments. For example, through ‘fast’ informal research dissemination, the authors of the original manuscript have observed practitioners within team sport settings applying average match-running performance within the model, replacing the average maximal performance measures within the original model in addition to completing PCA on measures and selecting the most appropriate measures to include within their specific context. However, to date, these different multi-model iterations have not been published within peer-reviewed journals. As such, we hope that through these two communications (Weaving et al. 2020; Owen et al. 2017), there is an increase in analysis of the multi-modal concept within team sports. Like all new concepts within sport science and science, these are subject to peer review analysis resulting in limitations being discussed and debated over-time; these discussions then result in new research that ultimately progresses the topic area. The original model was aimed at practitioners who were concerned about reducing the gap of understanding between training and game external loading reports for technical staff through a data reductionist approach that resulted in the creation of two targeted training measures namely: percentage volume SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN FOOTBALL 2022, VOL. 6, NO. 2, 270–271 https://doi.org/10.1080/24733938.2021.1942539",Science and medicine in football,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/24733938.2021.1942539?needAccess=true', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/24733938.2021.1942539?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/24733938.2021.1942539, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

65c74668c9a7696b7f6485124648fa1709aea270,Where Has All the Carbon Gone?,"Carbon is among the most abundant substances in the universe; although severely depleted in Earth, it is the primary structural element in biochemistry. Complex interactions between carbon and climate have stabilized the Earth system over geologic time. Since the modern instrumental CO2 record began in the 1950s, about half of fossil fuel emissions have been sequestered in the oceans and land ecosystems. Ocean uptake of fossil CO2 is governed by chemistry and circulation. Net land uptake is surprising because it implies a persistent worldwide excess of growth over decay. Land carbon sinks include ( a) CO2 fertilization, ( b) nitrogen fertilization, ( c) forest regrowth following agricultural abandonment, and ( d ) boreal warming. Carbon sinks in both land and oceans are threatened by warming and are likely to weaken or even reverse as emissions fall with the potential for amplification of climate change due to the release of previously stored carbon. Fossil CO2 will persist for centuries and perhaps many millennia after emissions cease. ▪ About half the carbon from fossil fuel combustion is removed from the atmosphere by sink processes in the land and oceans, slowing the increase of CO2 and global warming. These sinks may weaken or even reverse as climate warms and emissions fall. ▪ The net land sink for CO2 requires that plants have been growing faster than they decay for many decades, causing carbon to build up in the biosphere over and above the carbon lost to deforestation, fire, and other disturbances. ▪ CO2 uptake by the oceans is slow because only the surface water is in chemical contact with the air. Cold water at depth is physically isolated by its density. Deep water mixes with the surface in about 1,000 years. The deep water does not know we are here yet! ▪ After fossil fuel emissions cease, much of the extra CO2 will remain in the atmosphere for many centuries or even millennia. The lifetime of excess CO2 depends on total historical emissions; 10% to 40% could last until the year 40,000 AD.

8d92aaeab2a875f696b568f9c2c7789020ff5f9c,Brave New Curriculum: Aotearoa New Zealand History and New Zealand’s Schools,"Abstract Public history in New Zealand since the 1990s has been often dominated by the need to acknowledge New Zealand’s colonial past. Included in the British Empire by treaty in 1840 between the British Crown and its indigenous tribes, New Zealand’s European population has often idealized the country’s race relations. In recent decades, Māori assertiveness has led to a greater recognition of the damage done to Māori communities as New Zealand increasingly became a settler society. Inquiries into New Zealand’s colonial history since the 1980s have led to new settlements between Crown and iwi (tribal authorities). Demands that New Zealand’s colonial history be part of the school curriculum have also increased over this time. New Zealand’s decentralized social science and social studies curricula have been largely non-prescriptive, meaning that most children get little grounding in New Zealand’s history. In September 2019, the government announced that New Zealand history would become compulsory by the beginning of the 2022 school year. Defining this curriculum poses significant challenges to the country in a short period of time, challenges compounded by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",International Public History,2020.0,4,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1515/iph-2020-2007?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1515/iph-2020-2007, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The key technical barriers for the development of a mature biofuel industry include the availability of sufficient quantities of feedstocks; issues with existing infrastructure compatibility; environmental sustain ability concerns; and uncertainty about long-term economic viability, all of which depend on the overall efficiency of converting sunlight to biomass to fuel [1]. For example, the new US Renewable Fuels Standard requires the production of 36 billion gallons of renewable biofuels by the year 2022, of which 21 billion must be advanced biofuels. In order to reach this goal, we will have to produce 4.636 billion GJ liquid fuel energy (using gasoline as the standard). If we were to meet that goal using ethanol produced under current technology, approximately 58.6 million ha, which is approximately 17% of the US total farmland (36% of cropland), would be dedicated to growing the necessary biomass to feed biorefineries. Similarly, the rapid development of emerging economies, such as China and India, has also imposed serious challenges regarding natural resource constraints, both locally and globally. Considering the limited land and the tremendous need for food and fiber for their large populations, it is very unlikely that China and India will be able to dedicate a large proportion of their cropland to bioenergy feedstock production. To ensure that farmland resources are not strained and prime farmland is reserved for growing essential food, feed and fiber crops, overall efficiency must be enhanced for biofuel production so that fuel production per hectare is maximized [1,2]. In addition, proper biofuel production strategies and feedstocks need to be selected and optimized for different regions and countries. The biofuels industry and biomass utilization strategies have to be tailored toward various unique agricultural production systems, transportation infrastructures and socio economic structures that US–China collaborative biofuel research: towards a global solution for petroleum replacement",,2011.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4155/bfs.11.130?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4155/bfs.11.130, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d5a4112f56292a525388c3650f362ceada882fb8,The Case Against Taxing Robots,"A disturbing trend in the world of public policy in recent years has been the extent to which fads and groupthink now shape public debates and galvanize support for ill-advised ideas and proposals. In the first phase of this process, someone — often a person of some notoriety, but not necessarily expertise — puts forth a new idea or claim, which is then amplified by a media increasingly focused on marketing the next new thing. Then comes a wave of articles, speeches, blogs, op-eds, and of course TED Talks, all providing supporting “evidence” and arguments for why the initial idea is the “best thing since sliced bread.” Voila: What begins as a loopy, even harmful, idea is now all the rage. Once this critical point of no return is reached — when “everyone” knows something is true — policymakers have only a short distance left to travel to turn what appears to be an inspired analysis into actual law. 
 
In the subcategory of science, technology, and innovation policy, there is no better case in point than today’s increasingly popular view that governments should increase taxes on capital equipment. Or, as the advocates say, “It’s time to tax the robots.” This idea has been around for a while, and gained considerable traction in 2017 when Microsoft founder Bill Gates argued, “At a time when people are saying that the arrival of that robot is a net loss because of displacement, you ought to be willing to raise the tax level and even slow down the speed of that adoption somewhat.” After all, as a technology pioneer and billionaire, Bill Gates is anything but a tin foil hat-wearing Luddite. Since then, the calls for taxing those job-killing robots have become a veritable tidal wave. One can barely go a week without reading yet another article or comment on the topic. 
 
Robot taxers make three main arguments in support of their position: As this paper will show, all three arguments are wrong. At the end of the day, robot taxers are suffering from and contributing to a techno-panic over jobs. “Help!” they cry, “Robots are coming for our jobs! We can’t just eliminate any policies that support automation; we need to proactively erect barriers to it.” In fact, moving in that direction would be the worst possible thing for policymakers to do. Given that the U.S. economy has been in an unprecedented productivity growth slump for more than a decade, and the massive baby boom retirement wave is rising, economies desperately need faster productivity growth to have any hope of increasing after-tax wages faster than some minimal rate of growth. The last thing policymakers should do is reduce the incentive for companies to invest in new machinery and equipment, as that would slow down needed productivity growth. Instead, with first-year expensing provisions set to expire automatically at the end of 2022, one of the best things Congress could do to ensure strong growth in the future would be to make that provision permanent and then couple it with an investment tax credit.",Social Science Research Network,2019.0,7,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/ssrn.3382824?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3382824, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4a1942bf4fbad55ee7da3226ed48c0d3d062e3f1,Edward R. D. Scott (1947–2021): A tribute to an exceptional scientist and wonderful man,"Edward Robert Dalton Scott was born on March 22, 1947 in Heswall, England and died suddenly on October 7, 2021 in San Rafael, California, at the age of 74. He is survived by his wife Anneliese, his two daughters, Victoria and Rosemarie, and grandchildren Octavia, Theodore, Fiona, and Charlotte (the most recent addition, born November 19, 2021). Ed was a superb scientist with deep curiosity about the solar system and its origin, coupled with disarming modesty, a positive personality, a subtle sense of humor, and exceptional kindness. He will be missed. Ed received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Cambridge, England. Starting in October 1965, he was a student in the new Churchill College, about a mile from the university lecture theatres and labs in the city center. Like other Churchill residents making that journey morning, noon, and night, Ed became very fit and proficient on a bicycle, and pretty speedy, too. Ed studied mathematics, physics, and crystallography/mineralogy for 2 years then, fortunately for meteoritics, he concentrated during the third year on the last of these in the Department of Mineralogy and Petrology (colloquially known as “Min and Pet”). Min and Pet was a big tent, spanning subjects from crystal physics through to hard-rock geology. With his background in physics, Ed focused on X-ray crystallography, chemical thermodynamics, and mineralogy. He never took a formal geology course, but all students had to attend a field excursion to the Island of Skye during the final Easter Vacation, and there, in one of the worst weeks of wet and cold weather that Scotland has ever seen, Ian Sanders first got to know Ed as a friend. After graduating in 1968, Ed accepted a competitive entry position with the UK’s Central Electricity Generating Board, but he then turned it down. The Meteoritical Society owes a debt of gratitude to Stuart Agrell, a lecturer in Min and Pet who had an interest in iron meteorites. Agrell had secured a modest stipend to support a PhD student (far less than the electricity company would have paid), and yet he persuaded Ed that the pursuit of knowledge was more fulfilling than the pursuit of wealth. The rest is history: Ed went on to work on nearly every type of meteorite and published prolifically. He submitted his PhD thesis in 1971, within 3 years of starting. The outcome of the defense was never in question since, by then, he already had two Nature papers to his name (Buchwald & Scott, 1971; Scott, 1971). That same year he joined John Wasson’s group at the University of Meteoritics & Planetary Science 57, Nr 1, 154–157 (2022) doi: 10.1111/maps.13777",Meteoritics and Planetary Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/maps.13777', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/maps.13777?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/maps.13777, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9f1ebb1187fb854ea152e1964f4fe7b160ae9540,Remote sensing of planetary space environment,"Planetary space, a critical region of mass and energy exchange between the planet and the interplanetary space, is an integral part of the planetary multi-layer coupling system. Atmospheres of different compositions and plasmas of different densities and energies exist in planetary space, where mass transportation at different temporal and spatial scales and various energy deposition and dissipation processes occur. These processes are driven by the changes in the solar wind and the internal driving forces of the planet. Knowledge pertaining to the global mass and energy transportation in planetary space is essential to investigate the mass escape from the planets. Understanding the forces and physical processes that drive changes in the planetary space environment is not only beneficial to protecting the life, technical systems, and infrastructures on the Earth, but is also helpful in understanding the past and future. In this regards, the systematic and overall view of planetary space environments is necessary for planetary science. Optical remote sensing implies a measurement made by indirect or “remote” means, which relies upon either emitted, reflected, or scattered optical radiation. There are three main types of optical remote sensing technologies, namely imaging (photography), spectrograph, and spectrographic imaging. Scientific application of optical remote sensing dates back to 1906 when G. Galilei constructed the first astronomical telescope, using which he discovered the four Galilean satellites of Jupiter and the phase variation of Venus. Since then, several discoveries in planetary science have been made by means of optical remote sensing, such as the discovery of new planets and their moons, the discovery of the primary compositions of planetary atmospheres, global convection of cold plasma in Earth’s space, the discovery of planetary aurora (Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) and volcanic activity on Io, and water eruption on Enceladus. The optical remote sensing method overcomes the difficulties of capturing global views and distinguishing spatial and temporal variations in in-situ particle and field detections. Furthermore, through an overview of the history of planetary optical remote sensing, we propose a development strategy for planetary optical remote sensing, in China, based on the national deep-space exploration plan. A “Quaternity” planetary optical detection system that integrates ground-based, balloon-borne, space-based, and moon-based optical remote sensing is proposed. For example, the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS) is planning to construct a ground-based optical telescope with an aperture of ~1.5 m in Northwest China to monitor the volcanic activity on Io and to conduct other planetary observations. As the first planetary optical remote sensing project in China, the balloon-borne planetary optical remote sensing for the Scientific Experiment System in Near Space (SENSE) Program is introduced in detail. The SENSE Program is a five-year Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which began in 2018. A balloon-borne Planetary Atmospheric Spectroscopic Telescope (PAST) with an aperture of 0.8 m will be launched into the stratosphere at the height of 35–40 km to image the planetary atmosphere and plasma in the ultraviolet and visible range. The main scientific target of PAST is to comparatively study the diversity of the planetary space environment and their different drivers. Test and scientific flights are scheduled in 2021 and 2022 in Northwest China and potentially in polar regions. By using the data from PAST and in combination with other data (such as Jupiter’s auroral images from the Hubble Space Telescope, Mars’ space environment data from Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, and Jupiter’s space environment data from Juno mission), the couplings between planetary atmosphere and plasma will be investigated to characterize the diversity of the evolution of the planetary space environment.",Chinese Science Bulletin,2020.0,3,"{'url': 'https://www.sciengine.com/doi/pdf/B7D9CAF8896E48C9ADD85EC306956F29', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1360/tb-2019-0804?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1360/tb-2019-0804, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While GBIF already shares >109 data points, national initiatives are an essential component: increase in GBIF-mediated data relies on national data mobilisation and GBIF is not optimised to support local use. The Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility (FinBIF), initiated in 2012 and operational since late 2016, is one of the more recent examples of national BD research infrastructures (RIs) – and arguably among the most comprehensive. Here, we describe FinBIF’s development and service integration, and provide a model approach for the construction of all-inclusive national BD RIs.
 FinBIF integrates a wide array of BD RI approaches under the same umbrella. These include large-scale and multi-technology digitisation of natural history collections; building a national DNA barcode reference library and linking it to species occurrence data; citizen science platforms enabling recording, managing and sharing of observation data; management and sharing of restricted data among authorities; community-driven species identification support; an e-learning environment for species identification; and IUCN Red Listing (Fig. 1).
 FinBIF’s aims are to accelerate digitisation, mobilisation, and distribution of biodiversity data and to boost their use in research and education, environmental administration, and the private sector. The core functionalities of FinBIF were built in a 3.5-year project (01/2015–06/2018) by a consortium of four university-based natural history collection facilities led by the Finnish Museum of Natural History Luomus. Close to 30% of the total funding was granted through the Finnish Research Infrastructures programme (FIRI) governed by the national research council and based on scientific excellence. Government funds for productivity enhancement in state administration covered c.40 % of the development and the rest was self-financed by the implementing consortium of organisations that have both a research and an education mission.
 The cross-sectoral scope of FinBIF has led to rapid uptake and a broad user base of its functionalities and services. Not only researchers but also administrative authorities, various enterprises and a large number of private citizens show a significant interest in the RI (Table 1).
 FinBIF is now in its second construction cycle (2019–2022), funded through the FIRI programme and, thus, focused on researcher services. The work programme includes integration of tools for data management in ecological restoration and e-Lab tools for spatial analyses, morphometric analysis of 3D images, species identification from sound recordings, and metagenomics analyses.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2019.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.37253', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/BISS.3.37253?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/BISS.3.37253, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f0ab990c9920ed2f1cbdcd01c5c5109b7168f05f,Editorial,"As various institutions associated with occupational science—the doctoral programme at University of Southern California (USC), the Journal of Occupational Science, the USC Occupational Science Symposium, the Society of Occupational Scientists (SSO:USA)—approach and pass their 30-year milestones, it is fitting to reflect on the corpus of knowledge occupational scientists have accumulated. Put bluntly, what has been achieved? Not enough, according to Emerita Professor Gelya Frank, in her keynote address to the 27 USC Chan Occupational Science Symposium. Or perhaps, not the most important things. Speaking from her position as an anthropologist embedded in occupational science in the USA, Frank (2022) challenged occupational science to make a “consequential contribution” (p. 12) by addressing fundamental social issues: Racial injustice, social inequalities, white supremacy, the erosion of social cohesion, and the climate emergency. To that end, Frank asserted, occupational science needs testable propositions: “What is it about occupation that works and, importantly, what is it about occupation that doesn’t work?” (p. 2). Identifying consequential questions to mobilise around will mean bringing pragmatism’s focus on practical problem solving into play with critical theories, including her own occupational reconstructions theory, with its emphasis on shared narratives and collective actions of people who are committed to working together to change problematic situations that vex them. In one of two invited commentaries, Dos Santos (2022) amplified that call, describing Frank’s theory of occupational reconstructions as a melding of “social experimentation, solidarity through embodied engagement in shared occupations, relationships between shared narratives and collective actions, and noncoercive participation by people hoping to ameliorate a shared problem” (p. 1). Dos Santos emphasised both that the theory is applicable across diverse situations, and its ready application in professional education. Supporting those claims, Dos Santos offered an example of the differential impact of neoliberalism in Brazil, as illustrated by the case of the migrant workers recruited to build a modernist city in the 1950s and the present-day circumstances of their children and grandchildren.

The U.S. government is planning to fly an Earth-observing satellite that will be essentially colorblind, at least as far as the oceans are concerned.

The NPP satellite is a prototype for the $12 billion National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), a series of satellites to be launched between 2013 and 2022. In 2006, scientists learned that there was a problem with the filter on one of NPP's instruments, VIIRS, which will prevent it from accurately measuring ocean color, a window into how sea life responds and contributes to fluctuating atmospheric and ocean carbon. But officials with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) rebuffed a request last fall from scientists to correct the problem out of concern that working on the filter could jeopardize the other 21 parameters that VIIRS measures, including clouds, the extent of ice sheets, and forest cover. Last month, NOAA announced that a glitch in the system to regulate the satellite's temperature would push back the mission by 8 months, to 2010, prompting scientists to ask the government to use the delay to at least conduct a risk-benefit analysis of correcting the filter problem.

Last week, NOAA officials told Science that they have no plans to do such an analysis or to alter the timetable to accommodate any changes to VIIRS's filters. Instead, says NPOESS manager Dan Stockton, the agency will try to fix the ocean-color problem “for the first NPOESS” mission set to launch in 2013.

Scientists fear that the flaws in NPP will disrupt the longitudinal record on ocean color, because two experimental NASA craft now providing good data are near or beyond their 5-year design life. Color data from a European satellite have been difficult to use, and an Indian sensor has yet to be launched, they add. “Are we going to [make it] to NPOESS [in 2012]? I don't think so,” says David Siegel, a marine scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

But Art Charo, who follows the issue for the U.S. National Academies' National Research Council, points out that the ocean-color community is at least better off than other climate specialties that had instruments removed from NPOESS in 2006 and don't know whether they will be restored ( Science , 31 August 2007, p. [1167][2]). “With such a tight budget environment, it's a question of triage,” he says.

a042636ce3374a06fc316394c60b97797c8e7804,Biofuels and greenhouse gas emissions: green or red?,"As recently as five years ago, the promise of biofuels was seen as virtually limitless. Biofuels represented a source of secure, independent, and sustainable energy that promised to reinvigorate American agriculture, reduce soil erosion, expand wildlife habitat, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To be sure, biofuel, particularly corn-based ethanol, has always had its detractors. Among other negatives, corn-based biofuels drive up food prices, promote environmental degradation and losses in biodiversity, and contribute to water shortages. Biofuels currently consume >25% of U.S. corn production, leading to significant increases in the price of corn and related foods and products. Although it is widely recognized that cellulosic feedstocks have a much lower environmental footprint, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently adjusted the congressionally mandated 2010 100 million gallon yr-1 cellulosic biofuel mandate to 6.5 million gallons, a ∼95% reduction, based on the lack of progress in bringing cellulosic biofuels to the marketplace. In the near term, the production of corn-based biofuel will likely remain significant. There have even been fundamental questions about the net energy and GHG balances of biofuels. In 2006, Farrell et al. (1) addressed these criticisms by critically reviewing and re-evaluating the results of six extant studies of biofuels production. Their analyses revealed that some studies had incorrectly ignored the positive benefits of ethanol coproducts in calculating the net energy and carbon emissions of biofuels. When corrected, corn ethanol led to a significant yet marginal net reduction in green-house gas emissions of 13%. In contrast, cellulosic ethanol led to reductions as high as 88%. Two studies in 2008, however, fundamentally challenged these conclusions relative to GHG. Searchinger et al. (2) claimed that most previous life-cycle studies had incorrectly omitted or systemically underestimated the effect of landuse changes when calculating the net GHG effects of biofuels. As large-scale biofuels subsidies and mandates are enacted in the future, more and more forests, grasslands, etc., will be cleared, either directly or indirectly, releasing their tremendous stores of carbon (soils and plant biomass contain almost three times as much carbon as the atmosphere). When properly accounting for these land-use changes, Searchinger et al. (2) estimated that rather than reducing GHG, cornbased ethanol doubles emissions for over thirty years and results in increased emissions for 167 years. Switchgrassbased biofuels, even if grown on U.S. corn fields, would still increase GHG emissions by 50% over thirty years. In the same issue of Science, Fargione et al. (3) defined the amount of carbon released during the first 50 years after native ecosystems were converted to biofuel production as the “carbon debt.” They then calculated a pay-back period, the time that it takes the reduction in carbon emissions produced by the biofuels relative to petroleum to repay the initial carbon debt. Ethanol produced from corn on converted U.S. grassland, for example, would have a carbon payback period of 93 years. In other words, ethanol produced from corn on converted U.S. grassland would produce more carbon than the equivalent amount of petroleum fuel for almost 100 years. Even producing corn ethanol on abandoned cropland resulted in a payback period of 48 years. Only producing prairie biomass ethanol on marginal or abandoned cropland produced payback periods of <1 year. However, the bioenergy-producing potential of such lands on a global scale represents only a small fraction of global energy consumption. Both papers (2, 3) generated immediate and strong feedback, both positive and negative. In December 2007, President Bush signed into law The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA). In addition to mandating 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022, EISA established a new Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2), which required that the fuels used to meet the 36 billion gallon volume mandate meet certain thresholds for lifecycle GHG emissions. The new 2007 standard established the following classification system: conventional biofuel was defined as ethanol produced from corn starch, and new conventional ethanol facilities were required to achieve a 20% reduction in GHG emissions compared to a baseline lifecycle analysis relative to average petroleum fuels. Advanced biofuels were defined as non-corn-based renewable * mark.barnett@auburn.edu. RH ON DA SA UN DE RS Environ. Sci.

Each week, we select a Silicon Valley resident at random from the local teleview directory. Then, we use our fabulous LIFER intelligent agent progranl to collect all sorts of scandalous data about the individual that was chosen. Then, L1FER composes an embatxassing biography of that person using the data that was collected. It's allmeant to be taken in the spirit of good, clean fun. Of course, LIFER only collects information that can be attained legally over the Global Landscape. LIFER is fully compliant with rite GL-FIA, the Global Landscape Freedom of Information Act of 2013, that is designed to protect personal privacy. LIFER uses a powerful inference engine to extract information from data that appears to be anonymous. None of the provisions of the GL-FIA prevent this kind of massaging of anonymous data. If anything, LIFER shows that the GL-FIA should either be modified, imposing greater restrictions on the massaging of anonymous data, or repealed entirely, as being unenforceable in this age of global computer networks and communications. This week's subject is RandolfRedding who ct~entiy resides at 2345 Westinghouse Street in West Silicon Valley. Here is the biography that our LIFER progranl spun out on this fascinating human subjecL one of 700,000 fascinating human subjects in the greater Silicon Valley area. So, this is your life... RandolfRedding! Randoif, you were born on May 14, 2001 to Ben and Martha Redding at Silicon Valley hospital. Happy birthday! As you doubtless know, you are going to receive a free one year subscription to the Silicon Valley Sentinel-Observer just because you were chosen for This is Your Life. You attended Grover Cleveland Elementary School where you had to be called to the principal's office in the fifth grade because you set fire to a roll of toilet paper in the boy's room. Naughty you! You also put a dead mouse in poor Betty Natale's book bag and that got you snspended fi:om school for a while. At John F. Kennedy Middle School you were caught smoking in the boy's room and were suspended from school for an entire week, At Bjarne Stroustroup High School you straightened out a bit and maintained a Caverage. Of course, in your job application to ComputerCosmos (see below) you claimed that you had a B average in high school. Naughty, Naughty. You scored at the 38th percentile in mathematics and at the 29th percentile in verbal skills on your SATs. You gave up on the idea of becoming a brain surgeon (good thlnking!) and decided to join the ranks of the working man. You graduated from Stroustroup High in 2018 and went on to work as a salesperson at the ComputerCosmos computer emporium in Silicon Heights. It was shortly after graduation that you moved to the swinging single's apartment complex at 1213 Meandering Road in Silicon Heights. It was there that you received your first charge card, VISA card # 1245938431223, which has since expired. It would not be legal for us to reveal your present Master Card card number., but your present balance is $1,234.54 which ineludes a $231.45 interest charge. You bought many interesting tlfings with your original VISA card, but on the positive side you had a love for culture, being an avid reader of Henry Miller. You made repeated visits to Le Sex Shoppe where you purchased all sorts of interesting clothing items, hopefully for your girlfriends. It was at about this time that you opened an account on one of the Global Landscape movie services. During the first week of your subscription you viewed all of the ""Debbie Does"" movies, including ""Debbie Does Dallas"", ""Debbie Does Denver"", not to mention ""Debbie Does the National Football League"". Naughty, naughty. And you thought nobody would ever knowt It seems like good old Doctor Knowles on Klesmer Drive had to give you some penicillin shots back in 2021. Is that because of some hanky pinky with Claire Simmons, the woman that you spent a weekend with at the Mountain Lodge in Sun Valley? Yes, you registered under the name of Sam Jones, but you stupidly paid the charges with good o1' VISA card #1245938431223. According to the Silicon Heights Pharmacy database you have had many interesting prescriptions over the last ten years, not the least of which is a common antidepressant drug, which you are still taking, and a drug which is only prescribed for people who have a problem with alcohol. Perhaps your therapist, Dr. Theresa Clemmons, can help you with your depression and perhaps your frequent access to the Alcoholics Anonymous help site over the Global Landscape will help you with your drinking problem. Maybe yon learned your lesson after that escapade with Claire Simmons because on January 10, 2022 you married your present wife, Mary TisweU and just in time to greet that new brindle of joy, Randy, Junior, who was born three weeks later at Silicon Valley Hospital. It seems like you really got into calling someone at 1-900-999-9898 towards the end of 2022, Randy. Does the name Linda the Dominatrix ring a bell? It seems like that is her phone nunaber and she earns her living by talking dirty on the telephone. She told us some of your favorite fantasies. Naughty, naughty! Didn't you find conjugal bliss with Mary, the mother of your son? The surveillance cameras at Silicon Valley Mall are tied into an image database and much to our surprise we found your visage at the Mall Restanrant having lunch with Claire Simmous nearly every day during the spring and summer months of 2023. It's nice to catch up with old friends, but did you have to catch tip at with Claire at the Motel 6 on Route 10 on fourteen successive Monday afternoons? That's what the database says concerning the afternoons of April 24, May 1, May 8 need we go on of that year? Getting bored with married life, huh, Randy? In recent years you have really been into self-projection teclmology, but don't you think that visiting the Naughty Ladies Virtual Brothel six times in one week last December was a bit much? A little self-restraint wouldn't hurt. You were busted on June 10, 2024 for illegally obtaining copyrighted material off of the Global Landscape. That's considered a felony, but Tim Corson is a great lawyer and for a fee of $7,500 he managed to get you off with six months probation, So, Randy,.we hope you took this all in good fun.

000256e6f70339721aed4b432815e339f84b87cf,The economic value of America’s beaches,"Travel and Tourism (T&T) is among America’s largest industries, its largest employer, and its largest producer of a trade surplus. It is also one of America’s healthiest industries and is projected to grow at twice the rate of the U.S. economy over the next 10 years. The U.S. is the world’s most competitive country in tourism, attracting more than three times the number of international tourists as any other country. Surveys have repeatedly shown that beaches are by far the most popular U.S. tourist destination. There are about 3.4 billion visits to U.S. beaches annually. This is an enormous number of visits — more than 225% times greater than the combined annual attendance at all National Park properties from the Washington Monument to the Grand Canyon; state parks; all amusement-park attractions such as Disney World; all professional and collegiate football, basketball, and baseball games; cruises; and events of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. Beach tourists spend $240 billion annually, more than the value of all crops grown in America or oil exported by Saudi Arabia. They generate an economic output of $520 billion. U.S. tourism was hit hard during the coronavirus pandemic. However, unlike other tourism, beach tourism boomed during the pandemic, showing remarkable resilience as tourists flocked to beaches that they thought were safe because they were in the open air with plenty of sunshine. Since then, science confirmed the safety of beaches during the pandemic. Beach nourishment provides unprecedented economic return, sustainable employment, and storm-damage protection. It has an extremely high return-on- investment, with U.S. beach tourists generating annually about $3,000 in economic output, $1,400 in direct spending, and $200 in taxes for every $1 spent on nourishment. The $36 billion in taxes that U.S. beach tourists generate each year is over four times the total spent on all beach nourishment during the 100 years from the first beach nourishment in 1923 through 2022. Tourism jobs have boomed, providing one of every four new jobs in 2022. Moreover, tourism jobs in America cannot be outsourced and will not be impacted much by artificial intelligence. In addition to producing a booming economy by being a magnet for tourists, wide beaches and high dunes have been documented to provide billions of dollars in protection to land infrastructure during storms. However, beaches are threatened by erosion caused primarily by dams and navigation projects that greatly impact sand flowing to the coast and remaining in the littoral system. Beach nourishment is needed to mitigate this environmental impact and restore the balance.",Shore &amp; Beach,2024.0,25,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.34237/1009225?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.34237/1009225, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) is composed of four imaging (MTG-I) and two sounding (MTG-S) platforms. The satellites are three-axis stabilized, unlike the two previous generations of Meteosat that were spin stabilized, and carry two sets of remote sensing instruments each. Hence, in addition to providing continuity, the new system will provide an unprecedented capability from geostationary orbit. The payload on the MTG-I satellites are the 16-channel Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and the Lightning Imager (LI). The payloads on the MTG-S satellites are the hyperspectral Infrared Sounder (IRS) and a high-resolution Ultraviolet–Visible–Near-Infrared (UVN) sounder Sentinel-4/UVN, provided by the European Commission. Today, hyperspectral sounding from geostationary orbit is provided by the Chinese Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) instrument, and lightning mappers are available on FY-4A and on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) GOES-16 and GOES-17 satellites. Consequently, the development of science and applications for these types of instruments have a solid foundation. However, the IRS, LI, and Sentinel-4/UVN are a challenging first for Europe in a geostationary orbit. The four MTG-I and two MTG-S satellites are designed to provide 20 and 15.5 years of operational service, respectively. The launch of the first MTG-I is expected at the end of 2022 and the first MTG-S roughly a year later.

9469ee6b77e09059dd1e7f8c861f2aca2535f0b7,Cerebral venous disorders: the path forward,"Arterial diseases are well understood to be major causes of morbidity and mortality. High pressured arteries carry blood, oxygen, and other ‘fuels’ for organ function. In contrast, the waste clearance mechanisms for the body are much less understood. Increasingly, disorders of the body’s waste system are being investigated as they may be the etiology of conditions previously described as ‘idiopathic.’ It is now recognized that impairments in cerebral venous outflow may cause headaches and visual symptoms that are more than simply burdensome. Rather, they have been linked to potentially dramatic impairments in functional capacity, quality of life, and cognitive function that may be to varying extents reversible with treatment. On January 12–13, 2023, the newly formed Society of Neurointerventional Surgery (SNIS) Cerebral Venous and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Disorders Committee held its inaugural conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. Roughly 30 attendees from three countries, from industry and academia, including biomedical engineering, vascular surgery, hydrodynamic neurological surgery, spine neurosurgery, skull base neurosurgery, neurointervention, neurology, neurocritical care, and otolaryngology gathered to discuss the burgeoning, interrelated field of cerebral venous and CSF diseases. The Committee was formed from a universal recognition of need among experts specializing in primary venous disorders of the brain. For instance, the standardbearer for these conditions, the likely ‘misnamed’ idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with associated venous sinus stenosis, remains poorly understood and evidenced, even though venous sinus stenting incidence is on the rise. There are no published guidelines for patient selection or management, no published randomized trials evaluating treatment modalities, limited cooperative registry efforts to provide highpowered or quality data on outcomes, few technologies developed specifically for dural catheterization or stenting, limited organized patient referral networks or support resources, and no specific procedural codes to facilitate tracking and define appropriate compensation for specific interventions. Other less common primary venous disorders such as venous pulsatile tinnitus, CSFvenous fistulae, or jugular stenosis are seemingly more basic in terms of evidence, cooperation, technological innovation, patient resources, and coding. The Cerebral Venous and CSF Disorders Committee aims to provide thought leadership for the SNIS on the science, regulatory, device innovation, and clinical trials related to these disease processes. For the initial year, the Committee intends to apply for a hierarchical International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD10) code; organize white papers for cerebral venography, transverse sinus stenting, and diagnostic cerebral venography; and organize registries for procedures currently being performed. Patient portals, education, and other clinical resources will follow. The inaugural Cerebral Venous and CSF Disorders Committee conference comes at a time when JNIS content focused on venous pathology and interventions is on the rise (table 1). This increase in venous disorder submissions also comes with an expansion in the breadth of subjects. For instance, in the most recent calendar year (2022), JNIS featured a total of 14 manuscripts focused on a diverse set of venous disorder topics including IIH and venous sinus stenting, 6 dural venous anatomy and catheterization techniques, venous sinus thrombosis and thrombectomy, venous pulsatile tinnitus, 12 CSFvenous fistulae treatment, the treatment of symptomatic internal jugular vein stenosis, and even the first inhuman publication using a transvenous endovascular CSF shunt. 18 The Cerebral Venous and CSF Disorders Committee welcomes the involvement of SNIS members to forge new research, partnerships, and therapeutic strategies for these challenging patients. Increasingly, venous disease is associated with cognitive dysfunction; perhaps as we live longer, we will find that the health of the brain’s waste clearance is critical to brain function and longevity.",Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery,2023.0,10,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1136/jnis-2023-020251?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1136/jnis-2023-020251, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

New players, concepts, and technologies from the Information Technology (IT) domain enter the market and software receives a high priority. Inside the vehicle, the number of components, which consist mostly of software, are increasing and more and more software-based functions are offered. In addition, High Performance Computers (HPCs) are continuing to be integrated into vehicles. These aspects lead to several challenges with current vehicle diagnostics, but also enable new opportunities in that field. However, in the specific area of vehicle diagnostics, there exists only very limited literature that considers current challenges and new possibilities for future vehicle diagnostics. Some literature deals with the general automotive system design or shows results from about five years ago. The viewpoints of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) are not included there. This paper presents results from an expert survey in order to identify what challenges and new opportunities are currently affecting vehicle diagnostics in the year 2022. The survey was conducted within the publicly-funded project Software-Defined Car (SofDCar), which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. The survey shows the ongoing state of the vehicle diagnostics in the industry as well as needs and ideas from the perspective of diagnostics experts. In addition, the survey results are compared with respective statements from the academic, scientific area to decrease the gap between the industry and research communities. Therefore, aspects for possible future work in the field of vehicle diagnostics can be identified. Based on that, goals beyond the survey are to think about how a concept for HPC diagnostics could look like and how it might influences an approach for future vehicle diagnostics.",SAE technical paper series,2023.0,9,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4271/2023-01-0847?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4271/2023-01-0847, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

84a8cf8e9967bc3189a094aea53f3e3e337c3a1c,Performance and Consistency of Final Global Ionospheric Maps from Different IGS Analysis Centers,"Ionospheric delay is one of the most problematic errors in satellite-based positioning data processing. The Global Ionospheric Map (GIM), which is publicly available daily in various analysis centers, is thus vitally important for positioning users. There are variations in the accuracy and consistency of GIMs issued by Ionosphere Associate Analysis Centers (IAACs) due to the differences in ionospheric modeling methods and selected tracking stations. In this study on the International GNSS Service’s (IGS) final GIM, the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) (from 243 global navigation satellite system (GNSS) monitoring stations around the world) and the ionospheric TEC (from the Jason-3 altimeter satellite) are selected as reference. By using these three references, we evaluate the performance and consistency of final GIM products from seven IGS IAACs, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE), Natural Resources Canada (EMR), the European Space Agency (ESA), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), and Wuhan University (WHU) in the mid-solar activity year (2022) and the low-solar activity year (2020). Firstly, the comparison with the IGS final GIM shows that the consistency of each GIMs is basically the same, with the mean value ranging from −0.3 TECu (total electron content unit) to 1.4 TECu. Secondly, the validation with Jason-3 altimeter satellite shows that the accuracy of several GIMs is almost the same, except for the JPL with the worst accuracy and an overall mean deviation (BIAS) between 2 and 6 TECu. Thirdly, the comparison with VTEC extracted from GNSS monitor stations shows that the CAS has the best accuracy in different latitude bands with a root mean square (RMS) of about 2.2–4.7 TECu. In addition, it is found that the accuracy in areas with more stations for ionospheric modelling is better than those with less stations in different latitude bands; meanwhile, the accuracy is closely related to the modeling methods of different GIMs.",Remote Sensing,2023.0,9,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/4/1010/pdf?version=1677031928', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/rs15041010?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15041010, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Strategies to improve knowledge, awareness, and uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis among Black women will be more successful if information-sharing and implementation take place within trusted environments. Providing women with information through trusted cultural and social channels can effectively support informed decision-making about pre-exposure prophylaxis for themselves and members of their social networks who are eligible for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Objective The goal of this project is to improve knowledge, awareness, uptake, and trust of pre-exposure prophylaxis, as well as reduce pre-exposure prophylaxis stigma, among Black women living in the US South. Methods This multilevel, mixed methods study uses a community-engagement approach to develop and pilot test a salon-based intervention. There are three components of this intervention: (1) stylist training, (2) women-focused entertainment videos and modules, and (3) engagement of a pre-exposure prophylaxis navigator. First, stylist training will be provided through two 2-hour training sessions delivered over 2 consecutive weeks. We will use a pre- and posttest design to examine knowledge and awareness improvement of pre-exposure prophylaxis among the stylists. Upon full completion of training, the stylists will receive a certificate of completion and “Ask Me about PrEP” signage for their beauty salons. Second, together with the community, we have codeveloped a 4-part entertainment series (The Wright Place) that uses culturally and socially relevant stories to highlight key messages about (1) HIV, (2) pre-exposure prophylaxis, and (3) Black women’s social contributors to health. Quantitative and qualitative measures will be used in a pre- and posttest design to examine pre-exposure prophylaxis knowledge, awareness, risk, stigma, trust, intentions, and women’s perceptions of the usability and acceptability of the overall intervention and its implementation strategies. A video blog will be provided after each video. Third, participants will have access through an email or text message link to a pre-exposure prophylaxis navigator, who will respond to them privately to answer questions or make referrals for pre-exposure prophylaxis as requested. Results This project was funded in October 2020 by Gilead Sciences and was approved by the Duke University School of Nursing institutional review board in April 2021 (Pro00106307). Intervention components were developed in partnership with community partners in the first year. Data collection for phase 1 began in April 2022. Data collection for phase 2 began in May 2022. The study will be complete by October 2022. Conclusions Multilevel interventions that consider the assets of the community have promise for promoting health among Black women who have influence within their social networks. The findings of this study have the potential to be generalizable to other populations.
