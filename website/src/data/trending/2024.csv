f582076f3aab89cfdee51cbedacddd7767a9bcd2,AI Generated Code Plagiarism Detection in Computer Science Courses: A Literature Mapping,"This is a full research paper. Integrity in the detection of plagiarism in students' source codes in university programming courses is a research topic for instructors and institutions seeking to improve the quality of their teaching. In particular, introductory courses such as CS1, are of paramount importance, as this is when students gain fundamental knowledge to build their future on. With the latest developments in Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc., methods of plagiarism have evolved, however methods of detection may not be capable of accurately differentiating between code generated by human and artificial intelligence (AI). In this context, this paper seeks to answer the research question: What does the current literature report on AI generated code plagiarism detection in higher education? To expand on and formulate a comprehensive answer to our research question (RQ), we have formulated six sub-questions: RQ1) How many papers were published per year by country?; RQ2) Which conferences and journals have published most papers on this subject?; RQ3) Which plagiarism detection tools were most often used prior to common AI use?; RQ4) How are educators adapting assignments to minimize the use of AI?; RQ5) Which modern methods are being deployed to specifically detect AI?; RQ6) Which data sources and languages are most prevalent in the literature? The methodology was based on a systematic literature review. Initially, we confined our search for literature to Scopus and Web of Science, however additional literature was included from Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria were applied to include documents from the years 2023 and 2024 (after the launch of ChatGPT), and only published by conferences and journals. Exclusion criteria: papers that do not focus on plagiarism and programming courses; papers that are not about the undergraduate-level; papers not written in English. We found 165 papers via Scopus and WebScience, from which the metadata were collected, resulting in 17 relevant papers selected for this work. The second step was a search in Google Scholar, where we analyzed 200 documents from 2023 (100 relevant documents) and 2024 (100 relevant documents). We used the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, however, we included the ArXiv papers, and found 9 more papers. Following this process, we have identified 26 papers to include in this literary mapping. In this paper we present the answers to these research questions and discussions about this research topic.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893117?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893117, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is impossible not to take into account that information technologies are an independent discipline, a means through which the transformation of school and university education has been taking place in recent decades. The content of informatics at school and university should to a certain extent correspond to the level of science development and the requirements of society. The variety of digital tools and the ubiquitous availability of information create huge opportunities for their creative use within their discipline, related natural science subjects, and in various other spheres of human activity. Based on a comparative analysis, the article draws conclusions about the problems faced by both domestic and foreign specialists in the field of education. The article analyzes the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and problems of the school and university education systems in Russia and abroad, and considers their relationship. It is substantiated that the lack of consistency and discreteness in the process of teaching computer science and information technology at school lead to a discrepancy between the training of school graduates and the requirements for the basic knowledge of first-year university students. The article presents the results of the analysis of basic curricula at school (in the field of computer science) and curricula in the preparation of future computer science teachers at the university (using the Transbaikal State University as an example). The authors analyze the results of diagnostic testing, which was conducted with first-year students of the Transbaikal State University in September 2023/2024, in order to monitor their existing knowledge and skills in the field of computer science.

 As the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) celebrates its 100-year anniversary in 2024, we can also commend its specific role in supporting research on seeds. Indeed, one of ISTA’s objectives is “To actively promote research and dissemination of knowledge in seed science and technology, for the sampling, testing, storing, processing and distribution of seeds”. One of the main ways in which scientific knowledge of seeds is disseminated by ISTA is through its scientific journal, Seed Science and Technology, which itself celebrated its 50th volume in 2022 with a special issue of review articles and editorial (Jones, 2022). The review articles covered some of the history of research on particular aspects of seed testing, and gave up-to-date summaries of our current understanding of topics such as vigour, seed storage, tetrazolium testing, etc. Collectively, they cite many original research papers published in Seed Science and Technology. Since 2003, Seed Science and Technology has been available electronically at https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ista/sst, and articles published since 2018 are open-access, meaning that they are available for anyone to read for free. The 1973 to 2002 back issues of SST are available from ISTA at publication.sales@ista.ch.

015198e537da92e91cdc8ee6b59fc38ec560532c,30th NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC PRACTICAL CONFERENCE “NATURAL SCIENCE EDUCATION IN A COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL – 2024”: CONFERENCE REVIEW,"2024 is a truly special year. This is the year of the Jubilee Scientific and Practical Conference ""Natural Science Education in a Comprehensive School - 2024"". And this was the thirtieth conference. Throughout this time, science, engineering and technology have developed at a significant and rapid pace. The theory and practice of science education has undoubtedly evolved, including the strategies and practices of science education. The importance of science and technology education is unquestioned, but its orientation towards competences, with an emphasis on learning through science and the linking/integration of science with other subjects, remains. 
The 30th Conference continued an already established practice. The conference took place over two days. The two-day conference focused on science and technology education, which has recently become a priority in society and is likely to remain so in the future. The 30th Conference started on 25 April. On the eve of the Conference, an informal round table discussion on ""Education issues"" was organised. 
The importance of the cultural programme should also be mentioned. On the first day, at the end of the conference, participants had the opportunity to get to know Plunge better. The most important places of the city were visited. The staff of the Plunge Tourism Information Centre organised a sightseeing tour of Plunge. The city centre, the central square and the church were visited. Participants had a unique opportunity to walk around the Plunge Smart Park and to visit the Plunge Manor House, or Mykolas Oginskis Palace, one of the most beautiful monuments of 19th-century Lithuanian architecture.
The plenary session of the conference provided a retrospective of all the conferences. Thirty years of really great organisational, managerial, publishing and other work. A total of 30 conference proceedings were published. It is estimated that a total of 677 papers were published, with a total page count of 4787. If all the pages were put together, it would be a single publication 281 mm thick. This is a really big work, a really good repository of scientific and didactic-methodological research and work. 
The work of this 30th conference has been recorded and is freely available on our YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoZNO1c3zi72-RxbETp4AmMQ8Lz2C-QPC). Most conference reports were presented in the form of articles and published in the conference proceedings.

Chubaryan. It was followed by other textbooks in this discipline. Reconstructing their history and evolutionary transformations is important to reflect and evaluate the progressive development and achievements of Soviet and post-Soviet library science. This is a unique pedagogical experience of forming professional knowledge and self-awareness of several generations of future library specialists, many of whom became veterans of librarianship and contributed to its progress. In Soviet times four textbooks on library science were published, approved by the Ministry of Culture of the USSR for use in higher education institutions of the country — three editions of the textbook by O.S. Chubaryan (1960, 1968, 1976) and one collective work — “Library Science. General Course”, prepared by Moscow and Leningrad scientists under the editorship of K.I. Abramov and N.S. Kartashov (1988). The post-Soviet textbook “General Library Science” by V.V. Skvortsov and N.S. Kartashov (1996—1997) was published in two parts. The transition to the Bologna system of education in Russia and the activation of higher education served as a catalyst for the project of publishing textbooks for bachelors of library and information science, the first of which — “Library Science. General Course” under the scientific editorship of A.N. Vaneyev and M.N. Kolesnikova (2013). Later, the textbook of the Moscow State Institute of Culture was published under the editorship of M.Y. Dvorkina and L.I. Salnikova (2015). At the current stage of modernization of the country’s higher education system and withdrawal from the Bologna system of education, the updating of the entire series of textbooks began. The textbook “Library Science. General Course” edited by M.N. Kolesnikova (2024) is prepared on a different conceptual basis than the previous post-Soviet textbooks.

Thus, this quantitative research aimed to determine the mediating role of science motivation on the relationship between computer literacy and the academic performance of Grade 6 learners during the academic year 2023-2024. Modified and adapted survey questionnaires from the Department of Education Computerization Program (DCP), Cagayan State University – Andrews Campus, and Glynn (2011), using a 5-point Likert scale, were employed for data collection. Analysis involved mean, two-way ANOVA, and path analysis. Results showed that the Grade 6 learners exhibited a high level of computer literacy in terms of computer integration (mean=3.78). The academic performance of Grade 6 learners indicated a very high level in terms of student-related factors (mean=4.3). Concurrently, Grade six learners are often more extrinsically motivated (mean=4.09). Significant indirect relationship was shown between computer literacy and academic performance through science motivation. Significant direct relationship was also shown between computer literacy and academic performance. The total effect estimates of 0.531 (SE = 0.0804, Z = 6.61, p < 0.001) suggests that there is a significant overall relationship between computer literacy and academic performance, regardless of the mediating effect of science motivation.

c21f47d337124b66c40f5687dfbd9bdb6a280493,How to embrace interdisciplinarity in sport science – An approach at the ÖSG Congress Innsbruck 2024,"Introduction
The 19th Congress of the Austrian Sport Science Society (“Österreichische Sportwissenschaftliche Gesellschaft, ÖSG”), held in Innsbruck, Austria, centered on the theme of” Embracing Interdisciplinarity in Sport Science.” The idea of interdisciplinarity in sport science has been discussed for over three decades and stems from its position as a cross-sectional discipline integrating various natural and social sciences such as training science, sports medicine, biomechanics, sport pedagogy, sport psychology, sport sociology, and sport history. More recently, sports economy and sports management have also emerged as significant areas within sport science. Sports science is characterized by its strong practical relevance. It often focuses on applied research, where interdisciplinarity plays a critical role.
Interdisciplinary work is a particularly important factor when approaching sport science from a problem-based perspective (Güllich & Krüger, 2022). Specifically, we argue that interdisciplinarity becomes crucial when we are trying to develop solutions for complex challenges in sport, the health sector, and society in general. For example, an interdisciplinary approach in sport science might merge aspects of psychology, physiology, and sociology with expertise of medical professionals to study and realize health promotion strategies. For the purpose of this editorial, we understand interdisciplinarity as a collaboration between individuals from different scientific disciplines but also from different professions with the goal of combining knowledge and methods to create new solutions for complex societal problems. This can range from the simple communication of ideas and experiences to mutual integration of concepts, methodologies, procedures, or data sharing (Zaiț et al., 2021). We think that sport scientists can and should take a leading role in such collaborations given their unique cross-disciplinary education related to human health, performance, and well-being. Leadership in interdisciplinary collaborations may be an opportunity for us as sport scientists to strengthen our profile and image in the society and to take responsibility in addressing societal challenges (Hottenrott et al., 2017).
In preparation of this year’s ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024, we tried to embrace this idea of interdisciplinarity in sport science. Before the event, we conducted an online survey across the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) to identify current societal challenges that sport science should address and help with developing solutions. In parallel, we assessed the perceived importance of interdisciplinary work among sport scientists and related professions. Potential respondents to the survey were mainly contacted through the communication channels of the ÖSG and its equivalent associations in Germany (dvs) and Switzerland (SGS). Consequently, respondents included sport scientists as well as professionals from other fields who follow or are part of the activities of sport science associations. The findings of the survey were used in three different ways and will be described in this editorial:

to summarize the most frequently mentioned challenges and topics that sport science should address and help with developing solutions,
to develop an “Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop” for the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024 where delegates transform the identified challenges into specific problems that can be solved, and
to compare the survey results with the content of the scientific abstracts submitted to the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024 and determine the alignment between the identified challenges and current research topics within the ÖSG community.

The survey – Current challenges for sport science and beyond
The survey responses were analyzed in MAXQDA 24 (VERBI software, 2021). The MAXQDA AI-Assist tool was used to suggest an initial coding scheme to group responses into categories. Two researchers refined the scheme into a final code set, independently coded the participants’ responses, and discussed mismatches to agree on the final code assignments. The survey yielded 176 responses, of which 85 were fully completed. Respondents (42% women) had a mean age of 40.2 years (± 13.8). Regarding their primary professional field, 34% identified as scientists working at a university, college, or research institution, 26% were healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians or therapists), 15% worked in the private sector including self-employment, 13% were students or educators, and 12% were either coaches, athletes, or employed within a sports federation. 91% reported that interdisciplinarity was a key component of their work.
The most frequently mentioned challenges fell into the category of “prevention and rehabilitation” (34%), followed by “job profiles related to sport science and exercise therapy” (23%), “sport science mission for research and education” (11%), “broader societal issues” (5%), “structural development of organized and non-organized sports” (5%), “inclusion and integration through sports” (4%), “self-awareness and self-reflection” (3%), “technological progress” (2%), “financing” (2%), and “elite sports” (2%; orange bars in Figure 1). Coding was not possible for 5% of the answers.
The workshop – Transforming challenges into specific problems
Building on the findings of the survey, we collaborated with the ikivox collective (Nyon, France, https://ikivox.org/en/) to develop an “Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop” held at the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024. With the help of ikivox who specialize in collective intelligence and collaborative design approaches, we designed a workshop with the following objectives:

to transform the identified challenges into specific problems that can be solved with innovative solutions
to experience interdisciplinary collaboration and new ways of working together
to position the Austrian Sport Science Society (ÖSG) as an enabler, bringing value to its members to improve exchange about sport science in Austria
to identify whether the teamwork could continue on some topics after the Congress with the support of the ÖSG

Eventually, 42 Congress delegates signed up for the workshop and could choose to work on one of the following challenges: “physical inactivity at the work place”, “physical inactivity in children”, “image of sport science in society”, “role of exercise therapists in medical teams”, “influence of menstrual cycle on athletic performance”, “health awareness in society”, “inclusion of bodily disabled individuals as participants in public sport events”, and “integration of girls and women with migration background through sports”. This format of collaboration may provide a framework for future interdisciplinary initiatives within the ÖSG and beyond.
The Congress abstracts – Comparing the identified challenges with actual research topics at the ÖSG Congress
Having identified current challenges for sport science, it seemed of interest to compare those challenges with the content of the submitted scientific contributions to the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024. The Congress received 78 contributions including 60 regular abstracts, 12 Young Investigator Award submissions and 6 extended abstracts. Five section editors managed the peer-review process and drew on the expertise of 45 peer reviewers. Each contribution was evaluated and rated by two independent reviewers. Critical feedback of reviewers had to be addressed by the authors in revised abstract submissions. Following the revision round, 75 contributions were accepted for presentation at the Congress. The contributions spanned a wide range of research areas including “biomechanics, motor control & sports technology” (26% of abstracts), “sport psychology & pedagogy” (25%), “sports medicine, exercise therapy & public health” (20%), “sports physiology & exercise science” (16%), “sports sociology, economy & management” (14%). Of all contributions, 64 were presented orally and 11 as poster presentations while 65 abstracts were published in the Congress proceedings.
When applying the same code set to the abstract submission, we found a remarkable similarity to the survey findings in that 34% of abstracts fell into the category of “prevention and rehabilitation” (blue bars in Figure 1). However, we also found clear mismatches: the content of the abstracts focused much more on “technological progress” (21% vs. 2% in survey), and “elite sports” (15% vs. 2% in survey). Further, while 23% of the survey respondents highlighted challenges in “job profiles related to sport science and exercise therapy”, none of the conference abstracts addressed this topic, indicating a gap between perceived challenges and ongoing research.
Summary and outlook
At this year’s ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024, we tried to embrace interdisciplinarity in sport science by taking a problem-based approach to sport science. Based on a pre-Congress survey, we identified key challenges within sports and society in general that should be addressed by sport scientists. The most frequently mentioned challenges were related to the topic of “rehabilitation and prevention”, specifically physical inactivity in children and at the workplace. At the Congress, delegates participated in an “Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop” to work on the identified challenges and transform them into more approachable and specific problems. Interestingly, the topic of “rehabilitation and prevention over the lifespan” was also dominant in a third of scientific contributions to the Congress, showing alignment between perceived challenges and research efforts in the ÖSG community. In contrast, the topics of “elite sports” and “technological progress” were highly represented in Congress abstracts but were not perceived as current challenges in the survey. In turn, more than 20% of survey respondents perceived challenges related to the job profile of sport science alumn",Current Issues in Sport Science (CISS),2024.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.36950/2024.4ciss001?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.36950/2024.4ciss001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Reference Architecture was developed on the initiative of the National Open Science and Research Steering Group and the Ministry of Education and Culture. The reference architecture enables a controlled development and response of open science and research in continuous change. It ensures the stability of research structures as important facilitators of research. 
The Open Science and Research Reference Architecture is based on the goals set out in the Declaration for Open Science and Research, as well as the policies specifying these goals and the objectives and actions derived from them. Where necessary, the architecture has been complemented on the basis of international open science frameworks, such as UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science. 
There is no clear boundary between open science and closed science; rather, the open and closed variants form a continuum, where previously closed datasets may become open over time, for example. This is why the reference architecture describes the structures of science and research extensively – as open as possible and as restricted as necessary. 
The Open Science and Research Reference Architecture was created by a two-year working group appointed by the National Open Science and Research Steering Group. In the spring of 2021, a preparation group appointed by the Steering group prepared the task assignment for the working group. The working group chairs included Jukka Heikkilä from the Finnish Union of University Professors (first chair in 2022) and Susanna Nykyri from Tampere University (first chair in 2023).

b8720f51a6f035d41d6aaf8f254ba0db1f5a950b,Longitudinal stability and change across a year in children's gender stereotypes about four different STEM fields.,"Gender stereotypes about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) are salient for children and adolescents and contribute to achievement-related disparities and inequalities in STEM participation. However, few studies have used a longitudinal design to examine changes in gender stereotypes across a range of STEM fields. In a large, preregistered study, we examined the developmental trajectories of two gender stereotypes (involving interest and ability) in four STEM fields across three time points within a calendar year, starting in Grades 2-8. The diverse sample included 803 students ages 7-15 years old at the start of the study (50% girls; 8.5% Asian, 6.0% Black, 25.5% Hispanic/Latinx, 43.7% White, and 16.3% other). Multilevel growth modeling was used to examine developmental trajectories in students' stereotypes for four STEM fields (math, science, computer science, and engineering) while considering both gender and grade level. We found that different STEM disciplines displayed different developmental patterns: Math ability and science interest stereotypes more strongly favored girls over the year among elementary school participants, whereas computer science stereotypes less strongly favored boys over time, and engineering stereotypes (which largely favored boys) were stable across time. The results highlight that the development of stereotypes is not the same for all STEM fields as well as the need to understand the complexity and specificity of developmental change across fields and types of stereotypes.

This review evaluates the effectiveness of extended reality-based head-mounted display (ExR-HMD) technology in surgical education, examining its impact on educational outcomes and exploring its strengths and limitations. Data from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, WorldCat, and Google Scholar (Year: 2014–2024) were synthesized. After screening, 32 studies comparing ExR-HMD and traditional surgical training methods for medical students or residents were identified. Quality and bias were assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument, Newcastle–Ottawa Scale-Education, and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tools. Results indicate that ExR-HMD offers benefits such as increased immersion, spatial awareness, and interaction and supports motor skill acquisition theory and constructivist educational theories. However, challenges such as system fidelity, operational inconvenience, and physical discomfort were noted. Nearly half the studies reported outcomes comparable or superior to traditional methods, emphasizing the importance of social interaction. Limitations include study heterogeneity and English-only publications. ExR-HMD shows promise but needs educational theory integration and social interaction.

To map the evidence regarding the clinical performance of posterior restorations with bulk-fill resin composites and identify research gaps.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This mapping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews, and its protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework platform. Systematic searches were conducted, considering studies published between 2013 and February 2024 in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Clinical studies investigating the performance of bulk-fill resin composite restorations in class I and/or class II preparations with increments of 4 to 5 mm were included.


RESULTS
A total of 147 articles were identified, and based on the eligibility criteria, 26 studies were selected for descriptive analysis. Of the reviewed studies, 73% (n = 19) investigated high-viscosity bulk-fill composites, while 30% (n = 8) focused on low-viscosity bulk-fill composites. Evaluation periods ranged from 1 week to 10 years. Reported annual failure rates varied from 0% to 3%, with survival rates between 78.9% and 100%.


CONCLUSIONS
Bulk-fill resin composites of high viscosity were the most analyzed in the published studies, with evaluation periods of up to 10 years. The review of available scientific evidence showed clinically acceptable performance for composite bulk-fill restorations, with high survival rates and minimal annual failure rates. There is a need for long-term clinical studies on bulk-fill resin composites.


CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
This review demonstrates that both high and low-viscosity bulk-fill resin composites exhibit satisfactory clinical performance, which can help clinicians optimize chairside time.

cf1c517c1b05ed34adde3f1c5ef9bfad12586711,A 4-year field study monitoring the evolution of Trp574Leu-resistant plants in an Echinochloa crus-galli population under different crop rotation and herbicide programs in maize.,"BACKGROUND
A 4-year experiment evaluated the effects of different integrated weed management (IWM) programs on the evolution of a Echinochloa crus-galli population resistant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors in a maize cropping system. The programs included the continued use of ALS inhibitors, mixing them with alternative herbicides, or without ALS-inhibitors, in all cases under maize monocrop or a biennial crop rotation.


RESULTS
IWM programs that relied solely on non-ALS-inhibitors usually achieved high control levels across years (> 90%). Additionally, Trp574Leu-resistant plants became prevalent (> 90%) in programs only using ALS inhibitors, while in the rest the frequency of susceptible plants did not substantially decrease below 40%. Regarding the other monitored grass weeds, Digitaria sanguinalis and Panicum dichotomiflorum were effectively controlled in programs using ALS-inhibitors without soybean rotation or in programs without ALS-inhibitors altogether, excepting the program relying on an 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)-inhibitor under maize monocrop for the latter species (0%).


CONCLUSION
At the end of the experiment, the only IWM programs that reduced infestation levels were the one without ALS-inhibitors under soybean rotation, and the one with standard pre-emergence treatments. These findings highlight the effectiveness of crop rotation and alternative herbicides both pre- or post-emergence in controlling E. crus-galli. ALS-inhibitors, while challenged by resistance in E. crus-galli, remain valuable tools for managing other grass weed species in maize. It is crucial to adapt IWM strategies for herbicide-resistant E. crus-galli and other grass weed populations to mitigate the further evolution of resistance. © 2024 Corteva Agriscience.

9c4330b719547ca121d12417731b1ae513649dcb,Profiling First-year Students: An Interdisciplinary Challenge for Curriculum Design and Accompaniment Strategies,"The first-year transition is essential for student retention and success in higher education. This transition involves lifestyle changes, managing academic requirements, experiencing new situations, building networks with peers, and enhancing competencies for the learning process. In this context, it is important to design and develop strategies for student accompaniment to facilitate the adaptation process and strengthen their technical skills according to their discipline.Designing strategies to meet students’ needs means recognizing their entry-level status. In assessing competencies’ performance and attitudes towards the learning process it is crucial to use standardized instruments to collect accurate information for mapping a set of actions to support students’ academic experiences.Based on this, the School of Engineering at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana has implemented a strategy for the first-year transition focused on profiling students’ competencies and attitudes toward mathematics and science. The instruments considered the PISA framework and other validated scales.Since 2021, instruments for assessing mathematical competencies and attitudes have been applied to approximately 2100 first-year students. The instruments conducted for science have been completed by around 600 first-year students in the second term of 2023 and the first term of 2024. Adjustments have been included in line with the obtained results during the instruments' application.A first approach to the data gives guidance on the strengths and difficulties in mathematics and science areas. Most students need to build up interest, motivation, self-efficacy, and self-concept. Furthermore, students require reinforcement of numerical and geometry knowledge, problem-solving and representation competencies as well as explaining scientific phenomena.Considering the exploratory results, a challenge has been declared for different departments and units at the university in the curriculum design process and the accompaniment strategies. To cope with this challenge, a committee with representatives from academic and non-academic units has been set up to discuss students’ entry-level characteristics and needs, and pedagogical strategies used in the teaching process.",2024 World Engineering Education Forum - Global Engineering Deans Council (WEEF-GEDC),2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/WEEF-GEDC63419.2024.10854962?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/WEEF-GEDC63419.2024.10854962, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9b7fe948feb6e97e221452728890c844f82fcfcc,Comparison and AI-based prediction of graph comprehension skills based on the visual strategies of first-year physics and medicine students,"Graphical representations of data are common in many disciplines. Previous research has found that physics students appear to have better graph comprehension skills than students from social science disciplines, regardless of the task context. However, the graph comprehension skills of physics students have not yet been compared with (veterinary) medicine students, both of which are disciplines that require multiple science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses. This study extends previous research on this subject by exploring whether physics majors possess superior graph comprehension skills due to their study discipline. Here, participants solved 24 graph comprehension tasks across various subjects, including mathematics, physics, and medicine; these tests were conducted at the beginning and end of their first semester. Graph comprehension gain was calculated based on the percentage of correct and incorrect answers in the pretest and the post-test. In addition to these comparisons, we replicated previous research that successfully distinguished correct and incorrect solvers based on their visual behavior by using a novel machine-learning method tailored to small datasets. Through this replication of statistical analyses, we aim to ensure the reliability of adaptive learning systems in the future, regardless of data size, using the same machine-learning method. Physics and medical students were found to exhibit relatively similar graph comprehension gain; this is in contrast to previous research comparing physics and non-STEM students. Our results also revealed that both physics and medical students use similar visual strategies to solve these tasks. However, correct and incorrect solvers could be distinguished via machine-learning methods regardless of their discipline. Our research suggests that visual behavior is a good predictor of graph comprehension skills.

The respondents of the study are the grade seven students of a private school in Dumaguete City, during the academic year 2023-2024. The researcher utilized the descriptive, correlational, comparative, and Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial (CRT) methods of research. This study also made use of researcher-made questionnaires that measured the performance of the students in using the two methods of instruction, respectively. The statistical tools used in this study include standard deviation, mean, t-tests for dependent and independent data, and Spearman’s rho. The findings revealed that there is a significant improvement in the student’s performance after using localized litmus paper (p=0.001 < α=0.05) and computer interactive simulator (p=0.000 < α=0.05). Overall, both methods of instruction proved to be vital and effective (p= 0.597 > 0.05) in the student’s learning of the concepts of acids and bases. The results suggest that both approaches can be valuable tools for educators, enabling them to effectively cater to students’ different learning styles or maximize teaching effectiveness through varied instructional strategies. While using both methods of instruction resulted in comparable posttest success, the usage must be coupled with classroom dynamics, a helpful learning environment, improved study habits of students, and teachers’ positive behavior to achieve higher student performance.

 It is a pleasure to look back on the International Conference on Screw Machines 2024, which turned out to be a huge success. Held at TU Dortmund University, this year’s event was particularly special as we celebrated forty years since the conference was founded by the late Professor Knut Kauder. His pioneering work at the Chair of Fluidics laid the foundation for what has become a key forum for advancing screw machine technology.
 My team and I were excited to introduce several new elements to enhance the conference experience, including the shortened two-year cycle, which allowed us to spotlight the latest developments in the field. The option to present technical work without submitting a full paper opened the door for more people to share their insights. The continuation of the ICSM Science Update sparked lively conversations around ongoing projects and fresh ideas. Our lab tour and evening social event further added to the friendly, welcoming atmosphere, offering everyone a chance to connect in a more informal setting.
 A key highlight of the conference, as always, is the collection of research papers presented here in the proceedings. These papers reflect the outstanding work being done across our field, from fundamental research to real-world applications. The diversity of topics covered showcases the continued evolution of screw machine technology and demonstrates the importance of collaboration within our community. Additionally, all papers from past conferences are available as open access via the conference homepage (www.icsm.tu-dortmund.de), providing an accessible archive of knowledge on all types of screw machines.

Objective: To evaluate whether the addition of an interactive, clinically relevant computer-based gas exchange program and small-group exercise to reinforce principles of gas exchange improves medical student learning as measured by performance on relevant multiple-choice exam questions. Methods: This was a pre-post study design surrounding the implementation of a gas exchange program used during a small-group session with students working through a manual of prepared experiments during the 2023-2024 academic year at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Student examination scores before program implementation (academic year 2022-23) were compared with student examination scores after program implementation. Questions were dichotomized a priori based on their relevance to the principles reinforced by the program. Student perceptions of the program were assessed by a postcourse survey. Results: When comparing the control (n = 106) and intervention (n = 114) groups, scores improved for both non-gas exchange questions (P < 0.001) and gas exchange questions (P < 0.001). Although the improvement in gas exchange questions was greater than in other questions, this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.09 for the interaction term). Most students were satisfied with the program and rated it more useful than a traditional didactic lecture. Conclusion: At a time when medical school instruction is dominated by lectures with few laboratory-based exercises, we offer this interactive, computer-based program as a strategy to reinforce principles of gas exchange. By tailoring accompanying cases and exercises to different groups of learners, this resource can be implemented in diverse settings.",ATS Scholar,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.34197/ats-scholar.2024-0065oc?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.34197/ats-scholar.2024-0065oc, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3950577dbedc7179e8a7c01c54d3e0381d194a94,Enhancing Student Satisfaction through Emotion Detection and Recognition using Computer Vision with Predictive Analytics,"This study proposes an innovative method to enhance student satisfaction1 by integrating emotion detection2 and recognition using computer vision3 with visualization techniques4. Traditional methods like surveys often fail to capture the full scope of students' experiences. Our approach leverages real-time monitoring of students' emotional states to gain deeper insights into engagement and motivation, thereby improving overall satisfaction.

The objectives include developing a real-time emotion monitoring system, integrating facial API and computer vision for emotional recognition, using visualization techniques for data analysis, and assessing system effectiveness using the FURPS criteria. The study's significance spans various stakeholders: students benefit from improved academic outcomes, educators can tailor their teaching methods, parents can better support their children, and institutions can enhance their programs.

The research employs a quantitative descriptive design with participants from the computer science and digital animation programs, instructors, guidance counselors, and IT experts. Data will be collected through interviews, observations, and secondary sources. The project will be conducted over two semesters, with preliminary testing in the 2023-2024 academic year and full implementation in the 2024-2025 academic year.

Using the Agile Model for development, the system will feature a virtual YouCam web camera for emotion detection, visualization techniques for data analysis, and facial recognition for attendance monitoring.

 The article presents the observations of an online participant of the “Digital Humanities-2024” conference held in Washington, DC in the summer of 2024. The Digital Humanities Congress is held annually by the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO). Digital Humanities are usually at the intersection of computer or digital technologies and the actual agenda of the humanities. The role and importance of historical studies in the interdisciplinary field of digital humanities is growing every year. The annual ADHO DH-conference is the central event of the international DH-community and brings together scholars from all over the world, providing them with an opportunity to exchange ideas and research results, as well as promoting future collaboration. The article pays special attention to the historical issues presented at the congress. Brief statistical observations are presented. In 2024 (as in the past year), a trend towards an increase in historical papers can be seen. There is a growing interest in historical sources, historical databases and geographic information systems, issues of virtual reconstruction of the past using a wide range of digital humanities research tools. The conference theme of 2024 is “Reinvention and Responsibility,” it highlights two interconnected imperatives for the digital humanities community. Reinvention is a call to act with creativity, compassion, and intentionality to better meet the needs of our communities, while responsibility asks us to address those inequities and injustices that the global pandemic has recast in increasingly sharp relief. Explaining the essence of the congress theme, the organizers noted that recent years have forced the community to reinvent ourselves as colleagues, collaborators, and educators in ways that have had both positive and negative impacts. The theme of reinvention and responsibility encourages to reflect on these experiences, acknowledge our responsibilities towards our DH-communities, and—with those reflections—take steps.

However, we have no knowledge about the nationalities of the fastest age group backstroke swimmers. Therefore, the present study intended to investigate the nationalities of the fastest backstroke swimmers. For all World Masters Championships held between 1986 and 2024, the year of competition, the first and last name, the age, and the age group, and both the stroke and the distance were recorded for each swimmer. Descriptive data were presented using mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum values, and confidence intervals. The top ten race times for each swimming distance and sex were identified for descriptive purposes. Nationalities were then grouped into six categories: the top five nationalities with the most appearances in the backstroke swimming top ten times by distance each year and one group consisting of all other nationalities. The Kruskal–Wallis test compared nationality differences, followed by Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons to identify specific distinctions. Between 1986 and 2024, most age group backstroke swimmers (39.6%) competed in the 50 m event (11,964, 6206 women, and 5,758 men), followed by the 100 m event (32.3%, n = 9764, 5157 women, and 4607 men), and the 200 m event (28.1%, n = 8483, 4511 women, and 3,972 men). Germany had the highest number of top ten female swimmers in the 50 m backstroke distance. Brazil had the highest number of top ten male swimmers in the same distance. The USA had the highest number of female and male swimmers among the top ten in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke distances. Germany and Great Britain were the only countries with swimmers in the top ten for all female backstroke distances. Brazil, the USA, Italy, and Germany were the countries that had swimmers in the top ten for all male backstroke distances. In summary, the fastest backstroke age group swimmers originated from Germany, Brazil, USA, Great Britain, and Italy, where differences between the sexes and race distances exist.",Scientific Reports,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-68222-z', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11282104, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1c4f0357cbf97ca5338534a487179e12a66a3b3f,Robert (Bob) Anthony Altemeyer (1940-2024).,"Robert (Bob) Anthony Altemeyer (June 6, 1940-February 7, 2024) was an influential social psychologist who also shaped personality and political psychology. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Bob was educated at Yale (undergraduate) and Carnegie-Mellon (graduate). Following a 2-year stint at Doane College in Nebraska, he established his career at the University of Manitoba (Winnipeg, Canada) from 1968 to 2008. In 1986, Bob was awarded the prestigious American Association for the Advancement of Science Prize for Behavioral Science Research, largely for his development of the right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) construct. Whereas the authoritarian personality construct developed by Adorno and colleagues in the 1950s was rooted in psychodynamics, Bob drew on social learning principles and conceptualized authoritarianism as both an attitudinal orientation and trait. Not all of Bob's ideas held true, such as the social learning underpinnings that he proposed for RWA. But true to his inquisitive nature, he wrote that he would be excited to learn of RWA's strong heritable components if uncovered (as they later were). An anticonformist to the core, Bob published almost exclusively in books despite the field prioritizing journal articles, typically as sole author and working with few collaborators, and writing about complex ideas with rather informal and unconventional language. His legacy is proof that fighting the odds and remaining authentic, rather than chasing conventions and norms, can leave an indelible mark on science.

f644e7678a64e61c3eb6cc5c73ec7aa713717cd2,GOVERNMANET PUBLIC RELATIONS IN FACING POLITICAL YEAR: TRAINING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF MAGETAN,"The issues faced by Indonesia in the 2019 elections are likely to reemerge in the 2024 elections. In the 2019 elections, digital media became a highly effective tool for disseminating information related to politics and governance. Unfortunately, not all information available on digital media was accurate. Social media, in particular, saw a lot of misinformation and the spread of fake news (hoaxes). This led to a negative perception of the government among the public, which consequently influenced the opinions and political participation of Indonesian society. Therefore, a transformation is needed to support the formation of a positive government image. One of the strategies is maximizing government public relations. On August 8, 2023, the Communication Department at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, Universitas Airlangga, held a community service activity on the topic of government public relations training in Magetan Regency to address the political year. The main target of this activity was government officials in Bulukerto Subdistrict, Magetan District, Magetan Regency. The implementation mechanism consisted of three stages. In the initial stage, the community service team conducted surveys and coordinated with local government officials to gain a detailed understanding. During this stage, the Communication Department observed the involvement and performance of government public relations to obtain an initial overview of the strategies or designs used for the training. Subsequently, it was decided that the activity would be conducted through seminars and workshops covering topics such as public speaking, digital government, corporate social responsibility, and government public relations. After the activity, an evaluation was conducted to measure its success. It is hoped that this activity can serve as a foundation for improving the function of government public relations in addressing the political year and can be a supportive factor in ensuring the success of the 2024 elections.",Jurnal Layanan Masyarakat (Journal of Public Services),2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://e-journal.unair.ac.id/jlm/article/download/54421/28951', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.20473/jlm.v8i2.2024.247-256?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.20473/jlm.v8i2.2024.247-256, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

21f7755300cfed1822afa9a847652606d1c7b599,Learning Strategies For Listening Skills Among Arabic Learners In The Preparatory Year At Faculties Of Islamic Sciences In Turkey/ إستراتيجيات التعلم الخاصة بمهارة الاستِماع لدى متعلمي العَربيّةِ في السنة التحضيرية في كليات العلوم الإسلامية في تركيا,"Listening skills in Arabic are a gateway to acquiring knowledge and a means of learning and communication. However, many preparatory year students in the Faculties of Islamic Sciences in Turkey complain about its difficulty and suffer from weak listening skills for various reasons. Modern studies in foreign language education emphasize the necessity for learners to possess learning strategies for each language skill due to their significant importance in developing these skills and overcoming many problems and difficulties that learners may encounter. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the learning strategies specific to listening skills among Arabic learners in the preparatory year at some Turkish universities and investigate the impact of variables (gender, place of study) on their use of these strategies. The study was conducted on a sample of 127 randomly selected male and female preparatory year students nearing the end of their year at several universities for the academic year 2023-2024. To achieve the study's objectives, the researcher used the descriptive-analytical method and developed a questionnaire that included a graduated scale measuring the extent to which learners use these strategies, consisting of 20 strategies distributed across three fields: 1. Pre-listening strategies, 2. While-listening strategies, 3. post-listening strategies. The study showed that preparatory year students practice pre-listening and while-listening strategies highly, while post-listening strategies are practiced moderately. The study revealed statistically significant differences between the averages of the sample individuals attributed to gender, in favor of females, in using pre-listening and while-listening strategies, but no differences in post-listening strategies. The study also showed statistically significant differences between the averages of the sample individuals attributed to the university, with Sabahattin Zaim University ranking first, followed by Sultan Mehmet Fatih University in pre-listening and while-listening strategies. As for post-listening strategies, Sabahattin Zaim University ranked first, followed by Kocaeli University. These results emphasize the need for teachers to pay more attention to language learning strategies in all skills in their lessons, in addition to guiding their students to the correct learning strategies and training them on how to use them.",Ijaz Arabi Journal of Arabic Learning,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.18860/ijazarabi.v7i3.29340', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18860/ijazarabi.v7i3.29340?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18860/ijazarabi.v7i3.29340, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c3cd590087b91c31b6874ee47d3bfdcde1efccec,Improving Computer-aided Detection for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis by Incorporating Temporal Change.,"""Just Accepted"" papers have undergone full peer review and have been accepted for publication in Radiology: Artificial Intelligence. This article will undergo copyediting, layout, and proof review before it is published in its final version. Please note that during production of the final copyedited article, errors may be discovered which could affect the content. Purpose To develop a deep learning algorithm that uses temporal information to improve the performance of a previously published framework of cancer lesion detection for digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Materials and Methods This retrospective study analyzed the current and the 1-year prior Hologic DBT screening examinations from 8 different institutions between 2016 to 2020. The dataset contained 973 cancer and 7123 noncancer cases. The front-end of this algorithm was an existing deep learning framework that performed singleview lesion detection followed by ipsilateral view matching. For this study, PriorNet was implemented as a cascaded deep learning module that used the additional growth information to refine the final probability of malignancy. Data from seven of the eight sites were used for training and validation, while the eighth site was reserved for external testing. Model performance was evaluated using localization receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results On the validation set, PriorNet showed an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.931 (95% CI 0.930- 0.931), which outperformed both baseline models using single-view detection (AUC, 0.892 (95% CI 0.891-0.892), P < .001) and ipsilateral matching (AUC, 0.915 (95% CI 0.914-0.915), P < .001). On the external test set, PriorNet achieved an AUC of 0.896 (95% CI 0.885-0.896), outperforming both baselines (AUCs, 0.846 (95% CI 0.846-0.847, P < .001) and 0.865 (95% CI 0.865-0.866) P < .001, respectively). In the high sensitivity range of 0.9 to 1.0, the partial AUC of PriorNet was significantly higher (P < .001) relative to both baselines. Conclusion PriorNet using temporal information further improved the breast cancer detection performance of an existing DBT cancer detection framework. ©RSNA, 2024.",Radiology: Artificial Intelligence,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11427939', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1148/ryai.230391?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1148/ryai.230391, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Addressing AFR requires a One Health approach including Antifungal Ste-wardship (AFS). This study aimed to comprehensively review global studies published on fungal infections and AFR and to recommend solutions to address this growing problem. Materials and Methods: This was a narrative review that was conducted using published papers on fungal infections, AFR, and AFS between January 1961 and March 2024. The literature was searched using PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Results: This found that there has been an increase in fungal infections globally, especially among immunocompromised patients. Due to this increase in fungal infections, there has been a proportionate increase in the use of antifungal agents to prevent and treat fungal infections. This increased use of antifungal agents has worsened the problem of AFR contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Globally, fungal infections have contributed to 150 million infections annually and 1.7 million deaths per year. By the year 2023, over 3.8 million people died from fungal infections. Addressing AFR remains a challenge because the treatment of antifungal-resistant infections is difficult. Finally, the treatment of fungal infections is a global challenge exacerbated by the limited number of antifungal agents to treat invasive fungal infections. Con-clusion: The results of this study indicated that fungal infections and AFR are prevalent across humans, animals, agriculture, and the environment.

01b39affb5c57f3c8b257a5835b1add0c6aeef1c,Exploring the Bacteriophage Frontier: A Bibliometric Analysis of Clinical Trials Between 1965 and 2024,"In recent years, the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has posed a severe threat to global public health, necessitating innovative and alternative approaches to combat this escalating crisis. Bacteriophages, viruses that infect and replicate within bacteria, have emerged as promising candidates for therapeutic intervention against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This study delves into the intricate landscape of bacteriophage research, unraveling the trends and impact of research in the field. The analysis considers the chronological evolution of research, identifying key contributors, collaborative networks, and thematic trends that have shaped the trajectory of this rapidly growing field. Out of 101717 search results in the PubMed database, 163 clinical trials were identified, revealing a dynamic landscape of research activity between 1965 and 2024. The annual scientific publication analysis unveiled fluctuations in the number of publications, indicating an overall increasing trend. Notably, 2011 emerged as a peak year, signifying heightened activity in bacteriophage research. Employing Lotka's law, the authors' productivity analysis illustrated an inherent imbalance in author contributions, with a majority contributing to a single clinical trial. Co-authorship analysis highlighted leading collaborators. Co-occurrence analysis of keywords unveiled thematic clusters, providing insights into the diverse aspects of bacteriophage research. A word cloud emphasized significant terms, while a thematic map categorized themes into various developmental stages. Antimicrobial Agents, Chemotherapy, and Poultry Science were the most relevant journals based on the number of publications. The analysis of countries' contributions revealed the United States as a leading contributor, with Switzerland and China following suit. Collaboration patterns suggested predominantly independent research, with potential for increased international partnerships in certain regions. Additionally, temporal analysis of authors, institutions, sources, and countries revealed productivity patterns, historical context, and research shifts.

Postpartum post-traumatic stress disorders have significant health consequences for the mother, child, and other family members. Although it has tragic health impacts, little is known about this problem in the study area. Objectives The study aimed to assess the prevalence of postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder and associated factors among postnatal mothers. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was employed among 635 mothers in the first year after childbirth by using simple random sampling techniques from March 20 to April 20, 2024 in West Arsi zone, Ethiopia. Face-to-face interviewers administered structured questionnaires that were used to collect the data. The collected data were cleaned, coded, and entered into Epidata and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences for further analysis. Both bivariate and multivariable analyses were done by using binary logistic regression. Result Out of 635, 624 postnatal mothers participated in the study, for a response rate of 98.27%. The prevalence of postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder was 21.60% (95% CI: 18.40%, 24.87%). Primiparous mothers (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.38, 3.70), have no antenatal care follow-up (AOR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.47, 4.20), cesarean section delivery (AOR = 2.86, 95% CI: 1.50, 5.61), instrumental delivery (AOR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.75, 5.34), maternal morbidity (AOR = 2.94, 95% CI: 1.71, 5.05), and postpartum intimate partner violence (AOR = 7.43, 95% CI: 4.53, 12.20) were the identified factors. Conclusion and recommendation As identified, one out of five mothers had postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder. Thus, healthcare providers should focus on identified factors like cesarean section and instrumental deliveries while counseling, as this enhances the mothers’ psychological readiness. In addition, the West Arsi Zonal Health Office should develop effective strategies to alleviate the problem by focusing on the identified factors.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11552571, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

561e1d14b26ce63e19135a3b5b7118f3323e7700,Enhancing student motivation and achievement in science classrooms through STEM education,"

This qualitative study investigated how science teachers integrate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) into their lessons, focusing on the benefits, challenges, and implementation strategies. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 26 science teachers in public schools in Irbid Governorate, Jordan, during the 2023–2024 academic year. The findings revealed that while teachers generally have a positive attitude toward STEM education, they encountered significant challenges related to inadequate physical resources and time constraints. Additionally, STEM education was shown to promote student engagement in research activities. The study employed a thematic analysis approach to identify, analyze, and report patterns within the data, providing a detailed account of the themes that emerged from the teachers' experiences. The study underscores the importance of addressing these challenges to facilitate the effective integration of STEM into science education.

5ae9f9c47902a83ef3741b0f211b3b110aa7bed0,2024 update in heart failure,"Abstract In the last years, major progress has occurred in heart failure (HF) management. The 2023 ESC focused update of the 2021 HF guidelines introduced new key recommendations based on the results of the last years of science. First, two drugs, sodium–glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and finerenone, a novel nonsteroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), are recommended for the prevention of HF in patients with diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD). Second, SGLT2 inhibitors are now recommended for the treatment of HF across the entire left ventricular ejection fraction spectrum. The benefits of quadruple therapy in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are well established. Its rapid and early up‐titration along with a close follow‐up with frequent clinical and laboratory re‐assessment after an episode of acute HF (the so‐called ‘high‐intensity care’ strategy) was associated with better outcomes in the STRONG‐HF trial. Patients experiencing an episode of worsening HF might require a fifth drug, vericiguat. In the STEP‐HFpEF‐DM and STEP‐HFpEF trials, semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly administered for 1 year decreased body weight and significantly improved quality of life and the 6 min walk distance in obese patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with or without a history of diabetes. Further data on safety and efficacy, including also hard endpoints, are needed to support the addition of acetazolamide or hydrochlorothiazide to a standard diuretic regimen in patients hospitalized due to acute HF. In the meantime, PUSH‐AHF supported the use of natriuresis‐guided diuretic therapy. Further options and most recent evidence for the treatment of HF, including specific drugs for cardiomyopathies (i.e., mavacamten in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and tafamidis in transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis), device therapies, cardiac contractility modulation and percutaneous treatment of valvulopathies, with the recent finding from the TRILUMINATE Pivotal trial, are also reviewed in this article.",ESC Heart Failure,2024.0,28,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ehf2.14857', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11769673, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, within the space of 9 months these experimental vaccines were administered to millions through an emergency use authorization (EUA).The aim of this article is to raise awareness that medical science can be biased due to social and economic influences, especially during high stress epochs in history. Scientists should be conscious of always being objective and skeptical regardless of what is happening in the wider world.A literature survey was performed examining the reporting of severe adverse events (SAEs) in articles published between 2020 and 2024.From 2020 to 2024, the literature has gone from claiming there are absolutely no SAEs from mRNA based vaccines (2020/2021) to an acknowledgment of a significant number of various SAEs (2023/2024); including but not limited to neurological complications, myocarditis, pericarditis and thrombosis.The early scientific literature was biased, so as not to report SAEs, due to social and political concerns and overwhelming corporate greed. Only in the last year have scientists been able to publish articles that acknowledge a high number of SAEs linked to mRNA based vaccines. This should act as a warning that science should be completely objective when evaluating health risks, but can often be influenced by social and economic considerations.",Polish Annals of Medicine,2024.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.29089/paom/189961?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.29089/paom/189961, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of SD, but there has been no bibliometric research yet. This study aims to use bibliometric methods to analyze the current research status and hot topics of SD, to understand further the research trends and future development prospects in this field. Methods Retrieve core literature on SD from the Web of Science database and conduct a detailed analysis using CiteSpace and VOSviewer software based on factors such as publication volume, countries (regions), research institutions, journals, authors, highly‐cited papers, and keywords. Results From 1996 to 2024, a total of 1436 publications were included in the bibliometric analysis. The number of publications has shown an increasing trend year by year. The USA is the leading country in this field of research. The University of California System is the primary research institution. The International Journal of Dermatology is the journal with the highest number of publications. The author Yang Won Lee has the highest number of publications, while the article “Seborrheic Dermatitis” (2004) by Gupta, A.K. has been cited the most. “Seborrheic dermatitis” is the most frequently occurring keyword. The main research hotspots and frontiers in SD are as follows: (1) The relationship between SD and other skin diseases is a popular research topic; (2) Malassezia and inflammation are current research hotspots in SD; and (3) Focusing on antifungal and anti‐inflammatory treatments for SD is the current frontier direction in this field.

47415bf311fa37215252b73dff7e2028367c8d76,Updated science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators including retraction data,"Citation metrics are widely used in research appraisal, but they provide incomplete views of scientists’ impact and research track record. Other indicators of research practices should be linked to citation data. We have updated a Scopus-based database of highly-cited scientists (top-2% in each scientific subfield according to a composite citation indicator) to incorporate retraction data. Using data from the Retraction Watch database (RWDB), retraction records were linked to Scopus citation data. Of 55,237 items in RWDB as of August 15, 2024, we excluded non-retractions, retractions clearly not due to any author error, retractions where the paper had been republished, and items not linkable to Scopus records. Eventually 39,468 eligible retractions were linked to Scopus. Among 217,097 top-cited scientists in career-long impact and 223,152 in single recent year (2023) impact, 7,083 (3.3%) and 8,747 (4.0%), respectively, had at least one retraction. Scientists with retracted publications had younger publication age, higher self-citation rates, and larger publication volume than those without any retracted publications. Retractions were more common in the life sciences and rare or nonexistent in several other disciplines. In several developing countries, very high proportions of top-cited scientists had retractions (highest in Senegal (66.7%), Ecuador (28.6%) and Pakistan (27.8%) in career-long citation impact lists). Variability in retraction rates across fields and countries suggests differences in research practices, scrutiny, and ease of retraction. Addition of retraction data enhances the granularity of top-cited scientists’ profiles, aiding in responsible research evaluation. However, caution is needed when interpreting retractions, as they do not always signify misconduct; further analysis on a case-by-case basis is essential. The database should hopefully provide a resource for meta-research and deeper insights into scientific practices.",bioRxiv,2024.0,2,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.16.613258', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1101/2024.09.16.613258?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.16.613258, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 In this episode and transcript, Terry Palisch is joined by Karen Olson, the SPE technical director for completions, to discuss how SPE can help us collaborate more on a global level through our technical sections. This transcript is an excerpt from the podcast episode. Listen to the full episode here.
 
 
 
 Hello, I’m Karen Olson, SPE Completions Technical Director and president of Olson Turner Enterprises. I’m pleased to join 2024 SPE President Terry Palisch in this episode to talk about how SPE facilitates technical collaboration, particularly for our technical sections. As a technical director, I see the tremendous importance of our technical sections and the collaboration opportunities they provide. Thank you for inviting me to join you, Terry. I hope you had a great holiday and a happy new year.
 
 
 
 Thanks, Karen. I hope you did too. I want to thank you for being a part of the episode. Last month I had a great time speaking with Simeon Eburi, an SPE regional director for North America, about our regional sections. When I started thinking about who should host the technical sections episode, I thought what better person than the current chair of the Technical Content Committee on the SPE Board and current completions technical director. I know, having been in your shoes as a technical director, that the technical sections and SPE Connect, all things technical, fall under your purview. So, it’s good to have you here today.
 To start, I want to talk about technical sections because like regional sections, they’re key to fulfilling SPE’s mission of connecting our members. I don’t know if everybody understands what is available, particularly when it comes to technical sections, SPE’s technical communities, and SPE Connect. I think it’s important that members understand this is a big aspect of advancing technical competence by collaborating and advancing technology, as well as ultimately impacting their energy future.
 
 
 
 Terry, just like you, I’ve had the opportunity to be heavily involved with the technical sections. I now think they are as important as the regional sections. But for people who don’t know what technical sections are, maybe you can explain more about them.
 
 
 
 Technical sections got their start many years ago when we had something we called technical interest groups (TIGs). The first technical sections were formed in 2006 and 2007. It’s hard to believe they’ve been around that long. The first were wellbore positioning, drilling, and research and development (R&D). In 2007, our third TIG was carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), which I think is a surprise to people that we have had CCUS as a technical section for over 15 years.
 They are usually a subset of one of the technical disciplines, something that’s specific, like flow assurance or artificial lift and gas well deliquification. They gained popularity over just the last year. We currently have 22—five recently added including data science and engineering, methane emissions management, hydrogen, management, and this past year, we added plug and abandonment. The membership likes these, and I think they’re important.

12adecd8105076f2e5b2af16cf7f6b02297405d3,"PACMHCI V8, CHI PLAY, October 2024 Editorial","We are excited to present PACM HCI's 2024 issue on games and play research, which contains 63 original and highly relevant articles covering the entire spectrum of HCI games research. As in the previous year, we used three recommendations ' 'Accept with Minor Revisions', 'Revise and Resubmit', and 'Reject.' For papers that were accepted with minor revisions, the second round of reviews was a 'light-touch' process in which the editorial board members checked the revisions, whereas papers that received Revise and Resubmit received another full round of external reviews with the same reviewers in most cases, and were also subjected to a final selection process. This second revision was treated as a real resubmission, which meant that it was given full consideration, but no guarantee or preferential treatment towards acceptance; a share of the revised papers was ultimately rejected. We would like to acknowledge the efforts that our community has made in adapting to this new process, working together with the submitting authors to achieve high-quality scholarship. The track editorial board consisted of 32 members and a total of 230 external reviewers from around the world ensured a high-quality review process. After the first round of submissions, each paper was handled by a primary track editorial board member who received reviews from a second track editorial board member and two external reviewers so that each submission received at least three high-quality reviews. After reviews were completed and checked for quality, the primary initiated discussion amongst the reviewers and came up with a preliminary recommendation (accept, between accept and revise and resubmit, revise and resubmit, between revise and resubmit and reject, reject). Papers that were in the middle three categories were then discussed in two synchronous virtual track editorial board meetings that took place over two consecutive days. The inclusion of the board meeting at this stage was a new addition to the review process last year. We included it to better calibrate decision making across the committee at this critical point in the review process, ensure consistency in outcomes, promote reflection and consideration at this stage in the process, and mentor newer editorial board members in the review process. We strove for a diverse program approaching games research from a variety of perspectives, including design, engineering, psychology, computer and data science while at the same time only accepting high-quality pieces of work. In this issue, we observe the following distribution of primary contributions: 42.9% of papers self-classify as using qualitative methods, 11.1% use quantitative methods, and 20.6% use mixed methods. Additionally, 3.2% of papers present design artifacts and 6.3% present technical artifacts. Finally, 4.8% of papers employ meta-research methods, 6.3% of papers present a new methodological approach, and 4.8% of papers contribute to the development and validation of theory. All articles in this issue were invited to present at the ACM CHI PLAY 2024 conference. We thank our dedicated team of track editorial board members, external reviewers, and paper authors, who continue to support the new review process and timeline, contributing to the maturation and growth of the PACM HCI games and play research community, and resulting in this issue of 63 exciting and highly relevant articles. This issue's 63 papers reflect the importance of play in our everyday lives, comment on recent trends and technical developments relevant to games and play, and also represent a significant effort of our community in coming together to produce a collection of research that highlights the multifaceted value of play.",Proc.

ef868fa6de2f10037a5e24481a4ac0b3ce2840cf,Profitability of sugar beet production in 2023/2024 campaign on example of Lublin voivodeship,"The work presents a complex analysis and cost accounting of sugar beet cultivation in the 2023/2024 campaign for individual farms of the Lublin region. The economic results obtained by the producers are mainly affected by indirect cost accounting. Within this group of costs, the major components are sowing service, harvest and soil liming operations. Sugar beet production in the analysed years was profitable, with the profitability index about 1.26 and the production cost was 48.64 EUR·t-1. Sugar beet growing is considered one of the most profit-making activities in agricultural production, even though it is characterized by the high overall production costs. However, the incomes are different in particular years. The main factor affecting the income from sugar beet cultivation was the price for the raw material, which increased by only 9.5 EUR in the considered marketing year compared to the previous season. The limitation of the presented analysis of the costs of cultivation and profitability of sugar beet production is its preparation for a model farm with specific criteria. Further research should be carried out taking into account the classification of the analysed farms into groups with different criteria. This will allow for a better approximation of the performed analyses of cultivation costs to the actual conditions. A good direction for the development of individual farms is to combine science with practice in the pursuit of cooperation between growers and scientists indicating the economics of sugar beet production.",23rd International Scientific Conference Engineering for Rural Development Proceedings,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22616/erdev.2024.23.tf101?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22616/erdev.2024.23.tf101, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Every year, numerous major events with thousands of participants take place around the world, for which extensive safety measures are taken to ensure the well-being and safety of visitors. Nevertheless, incidents that lead to injuries and deaths occur time and again. This year, Germany is looking forward to the UEFA EURO 2024, an international football championship for which the host country, Germany, has made extensive preparations on several levels. One component of this is the Medical Task Force (MTF) of the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK), which has trained a possible medical service deployment in the event of a mass casualty incident with a specially coordinated series of exercises. The extent to which current remote sensing data can make a useful contribution and be meaningfully integrated was analyzed during the large-scale EUROMED exercise with the help of an airborne camera system on board a helicopter. The system provided up-to-date aerial images of the exercise site, but was also used to record the traffic situation during the transfer of the vehicle convoys to the exercise site.

8278d046e75f8a3d4ac15058c39f0005b9afeb8c,Computer Vision Meets Large Language Models: Performance of ChatGPT 4.0 on Dermatology Boards-Style Practice Questions,"Background: ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence that has numerous professional applications. Applications in medical education are currently being explored. ChatGPT 4.0 performance on image-based dermatology boards-style practice questions has not been assessed. 
Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy with which ChatGPT can answer dermatology boards examination practice questions.
Methods: 150 multiple-choice questions from the popular question bank DermQbank were inputted into ChatGPT. Of these, 83 were text-only questions and 67 had associated images. These same questions were inputted into ChatGPT again in July 2024. An additional 150 questions were inputted for a total of 300 different questions where 169 were text-only and 133 had associated images.
Results: Of the aggregate 300 question data, ChatGPT answered 232 questions correctly (77.3%). ChatGPT performed significantly better with text-only questions than with questions that included images (85.2% (144/169) vs 67.7% (90/133), P<.001). Of image-based questions, ChatGPT performed better with clinical image questions than with dermatopathology questions (69.0% (78/133) vs. 58.8% (10/17), P=.40), but this difference was not statistically significant partially due to the sample size of the dermatopathology questions. Compared to post-graduate year 4 (PGY-4) residents, ChatGPT performed above the 46th percentile. ChatGPT agreed with the answer choice picked by the majority of question bank users 75.3% of the time. Multivariable regression demonstrated that significant predictive variables for ChatGPT answering a question correctly included the percent of dermatology trainees who answered a question correctly and whether the question was text-based (P<.001and P=.004, respectively).
Conclusions: ChatGPT answered 77.3% of dermatology board examination practice questions correctly, performing above the 46th percentile of PGY-4 question bank users.

The journal “Acupuncture in Medicine” emerged as the most frequently cited publication. The most impactful article was titled “Acupuncture and dry-needling for low back pain: An updated systematic review within the framework of the Cochrane Collaboration.” Spain took the lead as the most productive country in this domain, with the United States closely following. Cesar Fernández-de-las-Peñas emerged as the most prolific author in the field. The Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Spain was recognized as the most productive institution for research in dry needling. As for journal keywords, “dry needling,” “trigger point,” and “myofascial pain syn-drome” were the triumvirate of terms most recurrently encountered. Conclusion The field of dry needling research has witnessed significant growth in recent years, characterized by the emergence of novel trends such as comparative studies with acupuncture, exploration into the mechanisms of action, and a transition toward interdisciplinary approaches. As medical models evolve, the focus is expanding from the exclusive treatment of muscle pain to broader applications. Despite this progress, the domain is underscored by a paucity of large-scale, multicenter clinical trials and animal studies. There exists an imperative for enhanced collaboration among academic and research institutions. A more profound exploration and comprehensive research endeavors are essential to enhance our understanding and broaden the clinical application of dry needling techniques.",Frontiers in Neurology,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2024.1465983', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11496255, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is our pleasure to share the valuable articles in a new issue of the Eur J Ther (2024; Vol: 30, Issue: 3). We would like to take this opportunity to thank once again the authors who submitted valuable papers to the journal and the referees who evaluated these articles.
In April 2023, we shared that the editorial team of Eur J Ther underwent many changes and was updated with a dynamic team [1]. We then made a series of improvements in a short period of time. First, we strengthened our editorial team with many internationally respected academics [2]. In July 2023, Web of Science calculated the journal’s impact factor value for the first time as 0.3 [3]. Then, with the dedicated work of the updated editorial team, the journal was soon included in many essential indexes such as Index Copernicus (approved 2023-10-31), ERIH PLUS (approved 2023-06-21), BASE (approved 2023-11-30), and Sherpa Romeo (approved 2023-09-27). As a result of our application, as of the beginning of 2024, articles that have not yet been assigned to the issue and are in early view have started to be indexed in the Web of Science in a short time [4]. This is reflected in the Times Cited and Publications Over Time graphic on the Web of Science (Fig. 1) [5]. Another significant development was that from 2024 onwards, the journal will be published six issues a year instead of four.
Through this editorial, we would like to share other good recent news and the journal metrics recently published by Clarivate Analytics with you, our valuable followers [6].
According to Journal Citation Reports 2024, Eur J Ther's journal impact factor value is 0.3 (Fig. 2) [6]. We believe that your valuable studies and contributions will increase this value.
The most pleasing result in the Journal Citation Reports 2024 data [6] is that the Journal Impact Factor Quartile value of Eur J Ther, which is in the Medicine, General & Internal Category, was determined as Q3. The Journal Impact Factor (JIF) Quartile for the Eur J Ther has been calculated for the first time this year, and we are delighted to observe that it is the Q3. In other words, according to the Journal Impact Factor value, Eur J Ther ranks 243rd among 325 journals in the Medicine, General & Internal Category (JIF Rank 243/325). However, we know we should do our best to go one step further and reach better levels.
As Stephen Hawking says, “However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.”
We look forward to sharing more good news with you.

16bfc7cdccb758a9031f38d827c84a48f536e19b,FLIPPED CLASSROOM IN SCIENCE EDUCATION: CORRELATING STUDENT EXPERIENCE WITH ATTITUDES,"Despite the growing adoption of the Flipped Classroom (FC) model in higher education, there is limited exploration of its impact on secondary education and students' attitudes toward science. Thus, this study aimed to examine the correlation between secondary school students' perceptions of the Flipped Classroom experience in learning science and their attitudes towards the subject. The research focused on five perception constructs: Collaborative Environment, Self-Directed Learning, Learning Impact, Motivation and Enjoyment, and Technology Integration. Students' attitudes towards science were measured across five constructs: Importance of Science, Practical Work in Science, Learning Science in School, Science Outside School, and Future Participation in Science. The study utilized a quantitative survey methodology, collecting data from a sample of 100 Form Four students at School A, Sabah, Malaysia as of the year 2024. Through the analysis of the survey, the study found a significant positive correlation between students' positive perceptions of the FC experience and their attitudes towards science. Notably, high ratings for ‘Motivation and Enjoyment’ indicated enhanced student engagement, while lower ratings for ‘Technology Integration’ highlighted areas needing improvement. The findings underscore the potential of the FC to positively influence students' attitudes towards science. This research implies that educators should seek ways to enhance student engagement and foster a positive attitude towards science through innovative teaching methods such as Flipped Classroom.

The study aims to examine 1. The level of task complexity for the students in science; 2. The level of students’ cognitive load in science; 3. The relationship between task complexity and students’ cognitive load in science. The participant of the study involves 87 science students from 3 different sections of grade-11 selected through purposive sampling. Participants answered a 42-item survey questionnaire divided into two parts focusing on the task complexity and cognitive load. The data collected were analyzed using statistical tool called SPSS. Analysis of the data shows several insights on the cause and effect of task complexity and cognitive load as well as the close direct proportionality of the variables. While complex task triggers the students to do more and improve their output better, there is still a need to improve in delivering and presentation of the task and lesson. A well-structured task that aligns with students' cognitive capabilities and reduce extraneous cognitive load can significantly enhance learning outcomes. By balancing task complexity with appropriate support, educators can foster deeper understanding and more effective learning experiences. Educators should continue refining task design to ensure it supports cognitive load management while promoting engagement. Further research is needed to explore how specific task structures impact different types of cognitive load across various learning environments. Additionally, developing targeted strategies to reduce extraneous load in digital learning contexts could provide valuable insights for improving online education.",International Journal of Latest Technology in Engineering Management &amp; Applied Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.ijltemas.in/submission/index.php/online/article/download/1118/455', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.51583/ijltemas.2024.1311012?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.51583/ijltemas.2024.1311012, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

An Editor-in-Chief Expert Panel Consensus Survey.,"Abstract The year 2024 is the 20th anniversary of the discovery of activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Since then, tremendous advances have been made in the treatment of NSCLC based on this discovery. Some of these studies have led to seismic changes in the concept of oncology research and spurred treatment advances beyond NSCLC, leading to a current true era of precision oncology for all solid tumors. We now routinely molecularly profile all tumor types and even plasma samples of patients with NSCLC for multiple actionable driver mutations, independent of patient clinical characteristics nor is profiling limited to the advanced incurable stage. We are increasingly monitoring treatment responses and detecting resistance to targeted therapy by using plasma genotyping. Furthermore, we are now profiling early-stage NSCLC for appropriate adjuvant targeted treatment leading to an eventual potential “cure” in early-stage EGFR+ NSCLC which have societal implication on implementing lung cancer screening in never-smokers as most EGFR+ NSCLC patients are never-smokers. All these advances were unfathomable in 2004 when the five papers that described “discoveries” of activating EGFR mutations (del19, L858R, exon 20 insertions, and “uncommon” mutations) were published. To commemorate this 20th anniversary, we assembled a global panel of thoracic medical oncology experts to select the top 20 papers (publications or congress presentation) from the 20 years since this seminal discovery with December 31, 2023 as the cutoff date for inclusion of papers to be voted on. Papers ranked 21 to 30 were considered “honorable mention” and also annotated. Our objective is that these 30 papers with their annotations about their impact and even all the ranked papers will serve as “syllabus” for the education of future thoracic oncology trainees. Finally, we mentioned potential practice-changing clinical trials to be reported. One of them, LAURA was published online on June 2, 2024 was not included in the list of papers to be voted on but will surely be highly ranked if this consensus survery is performed again on the 25th anniversay of the discovery EGFR mutations (i.e. top 25 papers on the 25 years since the discovery of activating EGFR mutations).",Lung Cancer,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=100230', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11208875, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2d853310b0d3ea0a27aa65edefa36e6186da5d69,The effect of project-based learning model based on differentiation learning on creative thinking skills in science learning,"Creative thinking skills are one of the skills that must be mastered in the 21st century. Increasing creative thinking skills can have an effect on increasing student learning outcomes. Project based learning model based on differentiation learning can be used to develop creative thinking skills. This research was conducted to determine the effect of the project-based learning model based on differentiation learning on the creative thinking skills of the fourth-grade students at elementary school in Kaliwungu District in the 2023/2024 academic year. Quantitative approach was employed with nonequivalent quasiexperimental pretest-posttest research design and one-shot case study. The population of this study was all class IV students at the fourth-grade students at elementary school in the 2023/2024 academic year using cluster random sampling technique. Smart PLS 4 was used for data analysis. The research results are based on the inner model test with a significance value of < 0.005 (0.000 < 0.005). These results show that there is a difference in the average creative thinking skill scores after using the project-based learning model based on differentiation learning. Based on this, it can be concluded that the project-based learning model based on differentiation learning has an influence on creative thinking skills. Recommendations for future research include exploring the long-term effects of this model on creative thinking skills and its applicability in diverse educational contexts. Additionally, investigating the impact of different types of projects and differentiation strategies on various aspects of creative thinking can provide deeper insights. Implications of this study suggest that educators should consider incorporating project-based learning models that emphasize differentiation to foster creative thinking skills. Such approaches can enhance student engagement and learning outcomes, preparing students better for complex problem-solving tasks in their future academic and professional endeavors.",Multidisciplinary Science Journal,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31893/multiscience.2025151?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31893/multiscience.2025151, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3a0d754e1634168a07431c8d1cfbe06e65cc7b5a,Online lesson study design: integrating environmental issues with science learning to enhance students' environmental literacy,"PurposeThis study developed an online lesson study, investigated teacher professionalism after following an online lesson study and examined students' environmental literacy.Design/methodology/approachThis study used a mixed-method research design. The qualitative approach entailed observing science learning focussing on environmental issues during Zoom meetings and interviews with teachers to gain insight into the online lesson study design. The quantitative approach involved testing learning outcomes, focussing on students' environmental literacy after one year of learning science by integrating environmental issue.FindingsThe result reveal that the online lesson study design is both asynchronous and synchronous. The teachers' teams asynchronously conduct the planning sessions. The implementation, observation and discussion sessions are conducted synchronously using an online meeting platform. Analysis of online learning during the lesson study shows that mind-on activities are performed using an online meeting platform. By contrast, hands-on activities are performed asynchronously with homework assignments. The relationship between teachers’ participation in lesson study and students' environmental literacy acquisition is positive. To improve the students' environmental literacy, online or hybrid lesson study in the future should synergise with environment-based co-curricular activities and science learning using a problem-based approach.Research limitations/implicationsThe limitations of this study are linked to the research subjects, who were situated in South Tangerang, an urban area in Indonesia. The outcomes may differ if the teachers and students are situated in rural areas. Additionally, an online lesson study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Indonesia was under lockdown. Consequently, students and teachers must be required to engage in remote learning from their homes using digital devices. Online teaching has caused suboptimal environmental literacy among students (64.55 ± 9.04), especially in terms of knowledge, skills and participation. Therefore, it is imperative to strategize for an enhanced teaching approach towards environmental issues in the classrooms. Teaching methods that actively engage students with their surrounding environment positively affect their environmental knowledge and awareness (Kalyanasundaram et al., 2024). In future lesson plans, educators should create learning activities within the classroom (intra-curricular) and involve family members at home (co-curricular). It is pivotal to incorporate tasks into online teaching that facilitate direct interaction between students and nature to shape their attitudes, behaviours and concern for the environment (Douglas et al., 2024).Practical implicationsThis study’s practical implication is that integrating environmental issues with science learning by framing them as crucial problems for students significantly influences students’ environmental literacy. Teachers strive to meet environmental education objectives that encompass knowledge, awareness, attitudes, skills and participation. Furthermore, teachers use problem-based learning to further improve their students' environmental literacy.Originality/valueThis study focuses on an analyses of an online lesson study design for science learning integrated with environmental issues. It examines the direct impact of online lesson study on increasing teacher professionalism and its influence on students' environmental literacy.",International Journal for Lesson &amp; Learning Studies,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1108/ijlls-08-2024-0169?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1108/ijlls-08-2024-0169, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b79ad114effb32a19be7cb8ad9104af7867ad89c,Advances In SARS-COV-2 RdRp Inhibitors: A 2023-2024 Literature Review,"Background: One of the major problems in drug design is to enhance the drug’s potency against genetic variants, for which adding a suitable pharmacophore to a newly designed molecule is preferred. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme responsible for genome replication and gene transcription into the human cell. Cryogenic Electron Microscopy resolved the first structure of the RdRp complex of SARS-CoV-2 in April 2020, followed by two other studies that reported similar structures that same year. The RdRp complex is built up from several nonstructural proteins included nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8. The protein nsp12 represents the core component and the catalytic subunit of RdRp, while nsp7 and nsp8 are accessory factors that increase the binding and processivity of the RdRp template. The nsp12 subunit contains an N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain, an interface domain and a C-terminal RdRp domain. Subunits nsp7 and nsp8 bind to the thumb, and an additional copy of nsp8 binds to the fingers domain. During replication, the active site of RdRp is responsible for incorporating free nucleotides into the daughter RNA strand of the replication complex. RdRp inhibitors, once metabolized, compete with the viral ATP molecules for incorporation into the nascent RNA strand. Once the RdRp drug replaces ATP in the new strand, the RNA synthesis process is terminated, thereby preventing further replication of the virus from occurring. In several studies reviewed in this manuscript, Molecular Docking simulations was employed to screen inhibitors that showed binding interaction with the conserved residues of RdRp. Aim: The purpose of the Review is to present a literature review from January 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024, on the advances in SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors as a therapeutic approach against the virus, emphasizing on the structure of the enzime, the non-structural proteins that comprises, in particular nsp12, nsp 8 and nsp 7, the mechanisms that underlie the antiviral activity of RdRp inhibitory substances, the structure of the nucleoside analogs that have demonstrated RdRp inhibition in structural biology and computational research studies, and examine the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of these nucleoside analogs. Materials and Methods: Original scientific articles published in Medline, Pubmed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO and BioMed Central databases, official health organizations (World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) electronic publications, and specialized media in the subject, were electronically searched to accomplish the aim of the study. Articles published in any language were included from January 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024, using a variety of keywords in combination. The studies relevant to our review were analyzed and compared. Results and Discussion: Inhibition of RdRp´s has been an integral approach for managing various viral infections such as dengue, influenza, Hepatitis C (HCV), Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), among others. Inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is currently rigorously explored for the treatment of COVID-19. Consequently, the importance of RdRp in developing anti-viral agents against this viral disease, has been discussed by the scientific community in the last four years. The structure activity relationship profile and binding conformations of the reported inhibitors are essential features to elucidate some hypothesis for the designing of further SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors. The search on scientific literature on these inhibitors, the analyses of the interaction characteristics, together with the examination of the inhibitors chemical structure, it would guide the rational design of antiviral medications and research into viral transcriptional mechanisms. Conclusions: Several RdRp inhibitors have shown promising results for their use in treating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While work must still be conducted to fully understand the mechanisms responsible for reducing the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2, their potential in healing infected individuals is extremely valuable. The development of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors, to relieve the severity of an infection for a SARS-CoV-2 variants that could emerge in the near future, it is an essential task for the scientific community. The analyses of inhibitors chemical structure-RdRp, besides the analyses of the inhibitors-RdRp interactions, it would guide the rational design of antiviral medications and research into SARS-CoV-2 transcriptional mechanisms. This review summarizes recent progress in studies of RdRp inhibitors, 87 compounds was tested, focusing on the chemical structure of the inhibitors and the interactions between these inhibitors and the enzyme complex.",Medical Research Archives,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18103/mra.v12i7.5389?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18103/mra.v12i7.5389, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a6c499b1bad2887e3c9c25f690b5b922af35d5b6,Growth of Science: How long will the United States uphold its position?,"Policymakers often assess the growth of science in a country and compare it with that of other countries to set future planning for scientific research focusing on the sustainable development and economic growth of the country. Here, we study the growth of science for the period of 1996-2020 corresponding to the top fifty countries with the highest publications in 2020. It is found that the annual growth rates of scientific and technical journal publications exhibit Taylor's power law behavior indicating the dependence of the variance on the mean growth rate and the distributions of annual growth rates follow skew-symmetric distributions. Furthermore, we have computed the entropy based on annual publication numbers among the countries to assess the spatial disparity in the system. The entropy is found to increase mostly linear with time reducing the disparity among the countries. By performing the linear regression analysis, we predict that around the year 2046, all the countries excluding China may equally contribute towards the growth of science. We have also assessed the stability of the current USA ranking by computing the entropy between the USA and other countries. Based on the regression analysis, it is estimated that three potential countries such as Indonesia, India, and Iran may take the ranks ahead of the USA around the years 2024, 2029, and 2041 respectively.",,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10771, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fd8e6df49ed844a17b87cf2e7715da51ef289cf2,"Abstract 1287: The ACCESS consortium: Advancing childhood cancer experience, science and survivorship in Canada","
 In Canada, >4,300 children, adolescents and young adults are diagnosed with cancer each year. 1/3 have refractory/metastatic disease or will relapse with an expected 5-year survival rate of <15%. The prognosis for most pediatric cancers has stagnated in the past 30 years and Canada trails the US and Europe in providing accessible clinical trials and improved outcomes. Advocacy for change by patients and families led to a federal government investment of $30M in pediatric cancer research. $23M was allocated to establishing a national pediatric cancer consortium. “ACCESS: advancing childhood cancer experience, science and survivorship” is the new multi-stakeholder network created with a vision that every Canadian child with cancer has access to the latest scientific advances, diagnostic tools, therapies and supportive care leading to better outcomes and quality of life.
 ACCESS will connect the Canadian pediatric cancer community, build partnerships, leverage research and clinical expertise across cancer types and ages, implement transformative change and create a unified national strategy. To date, >350 clinicians, researchers, policymakers, advocates, people with lived experience (PWLE; patients, families and survivors) and other stakeholders have been engaged, with a goal of representing Canada’s ethno-cultural, socioeconomic and geographic diversity. ACCESS is building partnerships between children, families, professionals, and existing programs to collaborate in coordinated research and knowledge mobilization. The goal is to implement transformative change in the delivery of fair, fast, effective and safe cancer care for all Canadian children.
 ACCESS has developed a statement of its values that includes patient/survivor and family centred; collaborative; anti-oppressive; innovation and excellence; accountable. Uniquely, ACCESS is an interdisciplinary and inclusive organization that directly engages and collaborates with PWLE at all levels of research and governance.
 ACCESS is organized into 7 themes that will address gaps, advance research and educate through all phases of the pediatric cancer journey: cancer biology; clinical trials; access to innovative therapies and optimal care; regulation, policy and economics; education and training; ethical, legal, societal implications and implementation science; and psychosocial and survivorship. In addition, there are two cross cutting groups focusing on Knowledge mobilization and Social justice, Indigenization and Inclusion.
 Collaborations with local, provincial, national and international initiatives are being established through the development of a partnership strategy. Cross-consortium priorities are being implemented, and a data management strategy is in development. The publication of a strategic and sustainability plan for ACCESS is anticipated in 2024.

f53a39172d59050b29e9ec09d62b4189287b3250,Marshaling science to advance large landscape conservation,"Applying science to conservation requires deliberate planning and action infrequently taught in academic settings. To illustrate impactful analysis and science communication, we describe scientific activities targeting the needs of land trusts, NGOs, landowners, and government agencies working to conserve the Florida Wildlife Corridor (“Corridor”). This 7.2 million hectare area is prioritized for habitat connectivity conservation in the US state of Florida. Our activities are built on decades of science guiding Florida land conservation. We quantified threats (e.g., average of over 14,000 ha of development/year from 2001 to 2019) and socio‐ecological benefits of Corridor conservation, prioritized yet‐to‐be‐conserved Corridor areas, produced and shared a new statewide connectivity model, and convened groups to identify campaign science needs. The new connectivity model—the Florida Circuit Model—supported the geography of the Corridor, as designated, and facilitates local (10 km radius, or less) conservation planning. Our efforts have contributed to allocation of over $2 billion for land conservation and the permanent protection of over 82,000 ha within the Corridor by state agencies from June 2021 to March 2024. Targeting science to outreach and policy, planning, and management decisions can motivate public, media, researcher, and government support for land conservation, improve conservation interventions, and attract research funding.",Conservation Science and Practice,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.13225', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/csp2.13225?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.13225, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d39f6e8ab52a8dd7fe5ca5da8056c3dfce15dee1,SCIENCE FICTION AND MILITARY ENGLISH: A CASE STUDY IN ITALY AND ROMANIA," Science Fiction and Military English: A Case Study in Italy and Romania. Starting from the premise that science fiction arouses the interest of both young adult readers and members of the armed forces, the current paper aims to evaluate the possibility of using this genre as a means of teaching Military English to first-year cadets. Additionally, this is an attempt to fill a gap left by specialized literature at national and international levels. The paper combines an eclectic theoretical framework, a synthesized lesson plan used to design and deliver experimental seminars involving forty cadets from two countries (Italy and Romania) and a survey accompanied by charts and explanations. The lesson plan is largely based on “Rome, Sweet Rome,” a 2011 SF short story by military historian James Erwin, and demonstrates that science fiction – particularly military science fiction—can be an alternative solution to traditional textbooks. The collected data prove that SF sources can help teachers conceive instructive and entertaining language classes, while also providing students with a formal, but comfortable environment, meant to facilitate their acquisition of military terminology and specific knowledge according to the STANAG 6001 requirements. The conclusion emphasises the great potential of the proposed method, but also signals that its successful implementation is heavily dependent on the teacher’s training, commitment and creativity as well as on the students’ receptivity. 
  
REZUMAT. Literatura științifico-fantastică și engleza militară: un studiu de caz în Italia și România. Pornind de la premisa că literatura științifico-fantastică suscită deopotrivă interesul tinerilor cititori și al membrilor forțelor armate, lucrarea de față își propune să evalueze posibilitatea utilizării acestui gen literar ca mijloc de predare a limbii engleze militare cadeților din anul I. Se încearcă astfel umplerea unui gol lăsat de literatura de specialitate la nivel național și internațional. Lucrarea combină un cadru teoretic eclectic, un plan de lecție sintetizat, utilizat pentru a proiecta și susține seminarii experimentale cu implicarea a patruzeci de cadeți din două țări (România și Italia) și un sondaj însoțit de grafice și explicații. Planul de lecție se bazează în mare parte pe „Rome, Sweet Rome” (“Roma, dulce Roma”), o nuvelă SF din 2011 scrisă de istoricul militar James Erwin, și demonstrează că textele SF – în special cele cu tematică militară – pot fi o soluție alternativă la manualele tradiționale. Datele colectate demonstrează că sursele SF îi pot ajuta atât pe profesori, să conceapă seminarii instructive și distractive, cât și pe studenți, să învețe într-un mediu formal, dar confortabil, care să le faciliteze însușirea terminologiei militare și a informațiilor specifice, conform cerințelor STANAG 6001. Acest articol se încheie prin a sublinia marele potențial al metodei propuse, semnalând totodată că succesul implementării acesteia depinde în mod semnificativ de pregătirea, angajamentul și creativitatea profesorului precum și de receptivitatea studenților.

d5d94cbe1b4e88b38c5a85e0e8f7e787feade916,The utility of high-dosage experiments in everyday life to test theories in clinical science.,"This viewpoint article discusses the utility of high-dosage experiments (HDEs) in everyday life to test theories in clinical science. HDEs involve experimental manipulations and assessments that occur over much longer periods of time than traditional experiments-generally days or even weeks. By nature, they also occur outside the lab, in the everyday environments of participants. Additionally, as with other experiments, the purpose of the study is concealed from participants. Experimental design is one of the most distinguishable characteristics of psychology that separates it from other behavioral sciences. Studies that rely on experiments are essential for theory testing and establishing the potential causal role of mechanisms that underlie psychopathology. Yet despite the value of experimental research, experimental studies are not currently given special prominence in clinical psychological science. For example, in the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, of all the empirical studies in the most recent year (2023), only three of 77 incorporated an experimental manipulation. Experimental research appears to be less popular in clinical psychology than in other fields, such as social psychology. What might account for this discrepancy? First, clinical samples are more difficult to recruit. This is important because experimental manipulations may produce small effects that require large samples for detection. Additionally, mechanisms hypothesized to underlie psychopathology are often chronic and intransigent. For example, cognitive factors (e.g., perfectionistic beliefs) could require an especially strong manipulation to modify in isolation. Researchers have argued that psychology has been experiencing a crisis in theory development. Eronen and Bringmann (2021) stated that one major reason for this crisis is the difficulty in establishing causal relationships between psychological constructs. The replication crisis has garnered even more attention (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). HDEs would help address these two crises and provide stronger and more replicable tests of theory. This could allow us to more precisely identify important mechanisms underlying psychopathology, potentially enhancing treatment efficacy, and enabling us to move the field forward.

0fe4422f63f888739debb346425c2ba5c22ed75e,156 Art as a Multiplier of Science Communication,"OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Scientists are increasingly confronted with 'science critical' #_msocom_1 belief systems. The politicization of science fuels hesitancy towards evidence-based therapies. To overcome these barriers, we aim to devise strategies to communicate clinical translational science (CTS) through art. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A two-year pilot artist-in-residency (AIR) program embedded in the Translational Research Immersion Program (TRIP). Since 2009, TRIP contributes to CTS Workforce Development (WD) through a 10-week mentored, curriculum-rich summer undergraduate research experience. Students are recruited from 5 regional institutions, 6 HBCUs, and the University of Puerto Rico. AIR is composed of 3 phases: the “Immersive Phase” where the artist gains intensive exposure to the scientific process through the lived experience of TRIP students, the “Productive Phase” where the artist conceptualizes the process of CTS into works of art, and the “Engagement Phase” where the CTS workforce, artists, and community members coalesce around science-to-art materializations. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In 2022 & 2023 the AIR participated in ~35hrs of CTS research seminars, panel discussions, and professional skills workshops. Additional TRIP student-AIR interaction occurred in focus groups including visits to mentor’s labs. An AIR-led workshop culminated in an Empowering CTS Communication event where TRIP students engaged with community members through elevator pitches of their CTS summer project on a speed-rotating basis. A month-long art-CTS exhibition planned for 3/2024 will feature contributions from AIR, TRIP students, and ITMAT community members. Qualitative insights were that TRIP is an effective art-science incubator, students strengthened their CTS communication skills, art functions as an icebreaker between science and communities with an ocean of opportunities for science education. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: AIR embedded into existing CTS WD programs is proposed as creative approach to strengthen the reputation of science in the public. CTS-informed art functions as connective tissue between public and CTS workforce. The hands-on experience to adopt art as a science communication tool is a powerful soft skill for the next generation of CTS investigators.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/A11D10F860E8F7E389B771C6F50B40C2/S2059866124001523a.pdf/div-class-title-156-art-as-a-multiplier-of-science-communication-div.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11026755, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

203325baa3f8d037cf32bfdd1300fcf0b331babd,The Carbon Footprint of Hospital Services and Care Pathways: A State-of-the-Science Review,"Background: Climate change is the 21st century’s biggest global health threat, endangering health care systems worldwide. Health care systems, and hospital care in particular, are also major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Objectives: This study used a systematic search and screening process to review the carbon footprint of hospital services and care pathways, exploring key contributing factors and outlining the rationale for chosen services and care pathways in the studies. Methods: This state-of-the-science review searched the MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), GreenFILE (EBSCOhost), Web of Science, Scopus, and the HealthcareLCA databases for literature published between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2024. Gray literature was considered up to 1 January 2024. Inclusion criteria comprised original research reporting on the carbon footprint of hospital services or care pathways. Quality of evidence was assessed according to the guidelines for critical review of product life cycle assessment (LCA). PROSPERO registration number: CRD42023398527. Results: Of 5,415 records, 76 studies were included, encompassing 151 hospital services and care pathways across multiple medical specialties. Reported carbon footprints varied widely, from 0.01kg carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents (kgCO2e) for an hour of intravenously administered anesthesia to 10,200 kgCO2e for a year of hemodialysis treatment. Travel, facilities, and consumables were key contributors to carbon footprints, whereas waste disposal had a smaller contribution. Relative importance of carbon hotspots differed per service, pathway, medical specialty, and setting. Studies employed diverse methodologies, including different LCA techniques, functional units, and system boundaries. A quarter of the studies lacked sufficient quality. Discussion: Hospital services and care pathways have a large climate impact. Quantifying the carbon footprint and identifying hotspots enables targeted and prioritized mitigation efforts. Even for similar services, the carbon footprint varies considerably between settings, underscoring the necessity of localized studies. The emerging field of health care sustainability research faces substantial methodological heterogeneity, compromising the validity and reproducibility of study results. This review informs future carbon footprint studies by highlighting understudied areas in hospital care and providing guidance for selecting specific services and pathways. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP14754",Environmental Health Perspectives,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11675664, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The initial release of near-real-time (NRT) atmospheric and oceanic science products from Japanese Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 (H8/9) geostationary (GEO) satellites over the South China Sea (SCS) was unveiled in 2024. The primary objective behind crafting these NRT H8/9 satellite products is to facilitate weather and marine environment monitoring, enhance maritime security, and aid ocean navigation, among other purposes. As part of this investigation, a novel NRT data processing system was devised to generate a variety of regional H8/9 GEO satellite science products within a resolution of 10 min and a gridded resolution of 0.05° × 0.05° from 3 November 2022 to the present. This algorithm system was built upon the preceding Fengyun (FY) geostationary satellite algorithm test bed (FYGAT), which was the prototype of the FY-4 GEO meteorological satellite science product operational processing system. These regional H8/9 GEO satellite science products encompass a range of crucial data such as cloud mask, fraction, height, phase, optical, and microphysical properties; layered precipitable water; and sea surface temperature. We subjected these products to rigorous evaluations against high-quality analogous satellite products and reanalysis data spanning 1 year in 2023. The validations underscore a strong consistency between the H8/9 GEO satellite atmospheric and oceanic science products over the SCS and the referenced products. Nevertheless, slight discrepancies in these satellite science products were identified, primarily stemming from variations in sensor/dataset characteristics, retrieval algorithms, and geometric conditions. These outcomes demonstrate the suitability of the first edition of NRT atmospheric and oceanic science products of H8/9 satellites over the SCS in supporting the intended quantitative applications. This NRT GEO satellite data record is publicly accessible through the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) provided by the Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) in China. Free access to the dataset is possible via https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25015853 (Liu et al., 2024).

(2024). Understanding spatiotemporal effects of food supplementation on host-parasite interactions using community-based science. Journal of Animal Ecology. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14155. Wildlife have become increasingly dependent on anthropogenic food supplementation, resulting in altered nutritional intake and inter- and intraspecific interactions. Subsequently, supplemental feeding can affect both the immunological function of individuals and transmission dynamics among individuals and species. The magnitude of the effect supplemental feeding has on disease is likely to vary across time and space with the nutritional demands of hosts. However, the broad temporal or spatial scale effects of supplementation are poorly understood. Recently, Knutie et al. (2024) introduced their citizen science program, the Nest Parasite Community Project, a broadscale coordinated effort by scientists and the public to monitor box nesting wild birds and their ectoparasites across the eastern United States. The authors amassed an impressive 4-year data set with hundreds of nests spanning the entire US breeding range of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis). In the first study to come from the project, the authors demonstrate that the effects of food supplementation on host-parasite interactions vary across time and space and do not consistently influence host-parasite outcomes, highlighting that host-parasite interactions are often context dependent and influenced by many environmental factors (e.g. weather and habitat quality). The authors also found that supplemental feeding increases host fitness, regardless of parasitism. The study provides strong evidence that citizen science projects can help broaden our understanding of how human food sources influence wildlife disease in various environmental contexts.",Journal of Animal Ecology,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/1365-2656.14208?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14208, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Young people including students are most active in business creation among the entire Russian people. The object of this study is students’ entrepreneurial intentions, and the subject is external factors that influence its formation. The empirical basis is a survey of 1917 students from various faculties of Moscow State University who took courses on entrepreneurship and the creation of technological startups in the period of 2020-2024. We confirmed the connection of students' entrepreneurial intentions with the following factors: the presence of entrepreneurs in the family or in the surroundings, societal assessment of entrepreneurial career, the university environment and the direction of study. We find that the proportion of students who have opened or plan to open a business in the short term is higher among students who have entrepreneurs in their family or among friends. The number of students with entrepreneurs in their surroundings is increasing with each additional year of study. More than half of students positively perceive how the public assesses the choice of an entrepreneur's career, while the presence of entrepreneurs in surroundings significantly affects this perception. We reveal that the students studying in such areas as business and management, public administration and political science have the highest indicators of entrepreneurial intentions, with minimal indicators belonging to chemistry, law and economics.

 Are you ready to join us for SPE’s Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition (ATCE) in New Orleans, 23–25 September?
 As SPE celebrates a century of innovation at the 2024 ATCE, we also mark the 75th anniversary of the Journal of Petroleum Technology (JPT).
 These twin milestones stand as a testament to the achievements that have driven our field forward—innovation, pushing boundaries, setting new standards, and fueling the energy that powers the world.
 Through the highs of technological breakthroughs and the lows of economic challenges, the oil and gas industry—and ATCE and JPT—have continually evolved, proving their resilience and adaptability.
 When considering the innovations in our industry, key advancements that often stand out include hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, deepwater exploration, enhanced oil recovery, digitalization and automation, LNG technology, FPSOs, subsea systems, and decarbonization and emissions mitigation.
 However, the incremental steps that collectively contributed to the broadly defined “wow” factors above are equally notable. To mention only a sampling: enhanced drill-bit designs, advancements in onshore and offshore drilling rigs, real-time data collection, development of 4D seismic technology, integration of multiple data types (e.g., seismic, well logs, production data) for more-comprehensive reservoir characterization, materials-science advancements (polymers, nanocoatings), development of blowout preventers, improved leak-detection systems, and advancements in produced-water treatment and recycling technologies.
 Less often recognized are the failures that were essential prerequisites for eventual success. The ""fail fast, fail often"" approach allowed for rapid feedback and necessary adjustments, though it also contributed to the downfall of some startups over the years.
 As individuals, embracing failure and viewing it as a stepping stone to success is not always our natural response. Presentations at industry events on ""lessons learned"" vary in transparency, often influenced by differing definitions of failure, stakeholder sensitivities, and legal considerations.
 As a result, many of the hard knocks that paved the way for the industry's ""wow"" factors remain largely unknown.
 ATCE’s theme, “Powering the Future of Energy with a Century of Innovation,” honors the legacy of past breakthroughs while celebrating their ongoing role in shaping a resilient and sustainable future.

In the past year, the use of large language models (LLMs) has generated significant interest and excitement because of their potential to revolutionise various fields, including medical education for aspiring physicians. Although medical students undergo a demanding educational process to become competent health care professionals, the emergence of LLMs presents a promising solution to challenges like information overload, time constraints and pressure on clinical educators. However, integrating LLMs into medical education raises critical concerns and challenges for educators, professionals and students. This systematic review aims to explore LLM applications in medical education, specifically their impact on medical students' learning experiences.


METHODS
A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and Embase for articles discussing the applications of LLMs in medical education using selected keywords related to LLMs and medical education, from the time of ChatGPT's debut until February 2024. Only articles available in full text or English were reviewed. The credibility of each study was critically appraised by two independent reviewers.


RESULTS
The systematic review identified 166 studies, of which 40 were found by review to be relevant to the study. Among the 40 relevant studies, key themes included LLM capabilities, benefits such as personalised learning and challenges regarding content accuracy. Importantly, 42.5% of these studies specifically evaluated LLMs in a novel way, including ChatGPT, in contexts such as medical exams and clinical/biomedical information, highlighting their potential in replicating human-level performance in medical knowledge. The remaining studies broadly discussed the prospective role of LLMs in medical education, reflecting a keen interest in their future potential despite current constraints.


CONCLUSIONS
The responsible implementation of LLMs in medical education offers a promising opportunity to enhance learning experiences. However, ensuring information accuracy, emphasising skill-building and maintaining ethical safeguards are crucial.

d87dfd26c1edcfa60b5b2f843a5c07f6e9202313,Impact of Generative AI in Academic Integrity and Learning Outcomes: A Case Study in the Upper East Region,"With the increasing use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and Bard, universities face challenges in maintaining academic integrity. This research investigates the impact of these tools on learning outcomes (factual knowledge, comprehension, critical thinking) in selected universities of Ghana's Upper East Region during the 2023-2024 academic year. The study specifically analyzes changes in student comprehension and academic integrity concerns when using Generative AI for content generation, research assistance, and summarizing complex topics. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining qualitative data from interviews and open-ended questions with quantitative analysis of survey data and academic records. The research focuses on three institutions: C. K. Tedam University of Technology and Applied Sciences, Bolgatanga Technical University, and Regentropfen University College. A purposive sampling technique recruited 150 participants (50 from each university) who had used Generative AI tools. Key findings show that 72% of students reported improved understanding of course material through Generative AI use, yet 75% cited academic integrity as a primary concern. Quantitative analysis revealed a weak to moderate positive correlation (r = 0.45) between AI tool usage and improved grades, with variations depending on the specific AI tasks performed. Qualitative data highlighted concerns about overreliance on AI and its impact on critical thinking skills. 
This research contributes to the ongoing debate on AI's role in education by providing valuable insights for educators and policymakers worldwide. The findings suggest that while AI tools can enhance comprehension, ethical considerations and potential drawbacks related to critical thinking require careful attention. The study concludes with recommendations for integrating AI literacy programs, developing ethical guidelines, and implementing advanced plagiarism detection systems to harness the benefits of Generative AI while mitigating risks to academic integrity. Although specific to the Upper East Region of Ghana, these insights may be applicable to other educational systems with similar characteristics.",Asian Journal of Research in Computer Science,2024.0,4,"{'url': 'https://journalajrcos.com/index.php/AJRCOS/article/download/491/975', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.9734/ajrcos/2024/v17i7491?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.9734/ajrcos/2024/v17i7491, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Incorporating GenAI into Technical Writing Assignments,"In an effort to foster critical reflection on the usage of generative AI (genAI) during computer science writing assignments, this three-part assignment challenges students to predict whether their peers can detect which essays are generated using AI. Implemented as part of a third-year professional responsibility and technical writing course for N=200 students during Spring 2024, students individually generated two short persuasive essays, one using genAI and the other without. They then combined the two essays into a single document and submitted it for peer-review. Additionally, they formulated a guess on whether their peers would be able to detect which essay was generated as well as a rationale for their guess. Following the peer-review process, students reflected on their own experience trying to detect which essays were generated as well as the outcome of their guess about their peers abilities as well. Feedback indicates its effectiveness in engaging students in their understanding of the potentials and limitations of genAI.

8ceb2849e22eca6aa188b773360a9526ee8b5b8d,Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for Ukrainian Stomatologists (Dentists) and Maxillofacial Surgeons: Criteria for Awarding CPD Points as of 2024,"Continuing professional development (CPD) of Ukrainian doctors-stomatologists (dentists) and maxillofacial surgeons is a continuous process of learning and improving the professional competencies of stomatologists and maxillofacial surgeons, which enables them to maintain or increase the level of professional activity in accordance with the needs of the health care sector. CPD can be both voluntary and mandatory, depending on the dental legislation of each European country. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the key legislation aspects of CPD related with criteria for awarding CPD points to the Ukrainian doctors of all eight stomatological specialties. The number of required CPD points and criteria for awarding CPD points are regulated by (1) Order of the Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine of February 22, 2019, No. 446 “Some Issues of CPD of Doctors” and by (2) the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of July 14, 2021, No. 725 “On Approval of the Regulation on the System of CPD of Healthcare Workers”. In 2024, at least 100 CPD points obtained in 2020, 2021 and at least 50 CPD points obtained in 2022, 2023 must be submitted by stomatologist for certification. In 2025 and subsequent years, at least 50 CPD points for each previous year must be submitted for certification. All 10 types of professional activities from the criteria for awarding CPD points are described. CPD points are awarded for obtaining formal, informal (type 1) and informal (type 2) education in the field of healthcare. The biggest number of points (namely, 100 CPD points) can be awarded to a stomatologist for obtaining educational and scientific levels of higher education in the field of knowledge “Health Care” (Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science). The smallest number of points, namely three CPD points, can be obtained for a professional medical internship in Ukraine outside the institution where the employee works. Modern Ukrainian legislation provides ample opportunities for doctors-stomatologists and maxillofacial surgeons for their CPD and certification. The criteria for awarding CPD points from Order No. 446 contain a complete list of educational opportunities in Ukraine and in other countries.

ac170b3487d6ed49fefdd4bba75e24cb4e345de9,Significant Differences Between the IQ Scores of Mathematics Students based on Regression Analysis and Factorial Experimental Design,"In this research, data on general intelligence and emotional intelligence scores were analyzed and the difference between them was studied in terms of their application to students of the Mathematics Department in the four stages in the College of Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Kufa for the academic year 2023-2024. Four statistical methods were used. The first was multiple regression analysis to study the extent to which each student's mathematics score was affected on the general intelligence and emotional intelligence tests (Y), by the student's gender (X1) and his type of residence (X2). The second statistical method is to analyze the design of a factorial experiment to study the presence or absence of significant differences between the grades of students in the four stages by classifying the students in the four stages into males and females, as well as studying the significant difference in the scores of the two intelligence tests (general and emotional) for students in the Mathematics Department in general and divided according to gender. requester. The third method of analysis was to analyze the design of a completely randomized experiment to study the significant differences in students’ intelligence scores between the four academic levels in the mathematics department. If there is a significant difference in the results of analyzing the data in the above methods, then we use the fourth statistical method in this research, which is the analysis of the least significant difference test to study the differences between each two groups separately. The results of the data analysis were numerous, the most important of which is that the intelligence scores in the two tests (general intelligence and emotional intelligence) do not depend on nor are affected by the student’s gender or type of residence. In addition, intelligence scores were not affected for the four educational levels.",Communications on Applied Nonlinear Analysis,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.52783/cana.v31.829?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.52783/cana.v31.829, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) continuously makes efforts to develop information systems for various academic and non-academic services for the lecturer and students. One of the academic services developed at ITS is myITS Thesis application. myITS Thesis is one of the applications prepared for the management of scholars Final Project. The Computer Science Doctoral Program (PDIK) has implemented the application for examination services including qualification hearings progress, seminars, and closed dissertation hearings. This study aims to measure the effectiveness of using the myITS Thesis application in managing PDIK dissertation research services to stakeholders, especially PDIK scholars. Measurements were carried out by surveying through questionnaires with PDIK participants who used the application in the 2023/2024 academic year. The effectiveness of the application is measured through five factors, namely System Quality (KS), Information Quality(KI), System Use(PS), User Satisfaction(KP), and Individual Impact(DI). The five factors are measured through 30 Question Indicators to 55 respondents. The results of the questionnaire survey were processed using descriptive analysis and CFA modeling. CFA is used to measure validity and reliability through Standardized Loading Factor (SLF), Cronbach Alpha (CA), and Composite Reliability (CR) values. It is concluded from the modeling results based on validity and reliability measurements that the KS factor is valid with CA value=0.931 and reliable with CR value=0.73, the KI factor is valid with CA value=0.923 and reliable with CR value=0.706, the PS factor is valid with CA value=0.95 and reliable with CR value=0.734. While the KP factor is valid with CA value=0.972 and reliable with CR value= 0.814.

741ac17a00dac477c233544e87ede6d5095bfd57,How to Improve Test Performance by Moodle Statistics,"Creation of properly balanced tests and their evaluation is an important part of the educational process, which is dealt with by the theory of testing. The most popular testing theories are Classical test theory and Item response theory. In this paper, we will focus on metrics used in the Item response theory, which deals with evaluating the performance of the test from the point of view of individual questions, through metrics such as the Discrimination index, Item difficulty, Random score estimate, and others. In the 2023/2024 academic term, 239 second-year students in the field of computer science participated in the Operating Systems course. After passing each test, we proceeded to evaluate the test performance based on the statistics available in the MoodIe system. We evaluated a total of 41 testing items, primarily focused on Discrimination index, Item difficulty, Intended weight and Efficiency weight. We identified 5 testing items, which do not perform well enough. In order to be able to evaluate the overall test performance, we decided to calculate the reliability of the test using the Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR20) metric. KR20 metric is used to measure the internal consistency reliability of a test. We calculated the KR20 value before adjusting all three tests, and also after adjusting the tests. In all three cases there was an improvement in the value of KR20 in the interval from 3.63% to 5.37%, which indicates higher internal consistency of all three tests. Conclusion: We evaluated test performance of 3 tests based on the MoodIe statistics. We identified five testing items that were shown not to work based on manual verification as well as on the MoodIe test statistics. We eliminated those testing items and observed an improvement in the test reliability calculated by KR20 metric, resulting in an improvement in test performance.",International Conference on Emerging eLearning Technologies and Applications,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICETA63795.2024.10850813?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETA63795.2024.10850813, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2885ac6015aa5cd7743ab6b172ff650ba16ebedc,Exploring Stormwater Best Management Practices for Urban Flood Reduction in Khulna City of Bangladesh Using PCSWMM,"Khulna City Corporation (KCC), located in a low-lying area in southwestern Bangladesh, has been suffering from frequent water logging in the rainy season almost every year. This situation is intensified due to rapid urbanization and the impact of climate change, which have consequently created numerous problems in KCC related to stormwater management issues that require immediate consideration. Therefore, the current study aims to explore stormwater management problems in KCC and find possible countermeasures through different best management practices. Stormwater management must be incorporated into urban design and development, particularly in densely populated urban areas like KCC. In Ward No. 30 of KCC, controlling stormwater is a vital concern due to heavy rainfall, a lack of proper drainage infrastructure, unplanned growth, extensive land cover areas, etc. In the current study, the most widely used Personnel Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM) software was adopted to evaluate the city's current stormwater management practices and develop a long-term stormwater management strategy. A reconnaissance investigation of the existing states of the soil, drainage, and outlet infrastructures was conducted. The study area (KCC Ward No. 30) was then divided into many small catchments in the ArcGIS platform, and areas of each sub-catchment were identified. To determine the percentage of impervious area and the elevation of the study area, the land use and land cover (LULC) map and the digital elevation model (DEM) were generated using the ArcGIS software. All the aforementioned parameters were then entered into the PCSWMM software, and simulations were performed for various rainfall durations using different best management practices. The PCSWMM simulation provided the results of runoff, infiltration, peak runoff, floods, or surcharges at every drainage node or discharge point in the existing and altered drainage system of the study area due to the occurrence of extreme rainfall. The results indicate that various best management practices, increasing the slope, reducing the roughness of the drainage systems, reducing imperviousness, permitting more infiltrations, and promoting green infrastructure, are highly effective in controlling urban flooding or surcharges in the study area caused by the occurrence of extreme rainfall in the future. The findings of this study are expected to be supportive to policymakers, urban planners, and water managers in implementing and promoting sustainable and climate-resilient urban drainage infrastructures to tackle stormwater management problems in the KCC area.

b7f72719670754ff294efd46436936a233e59453,The impact of patellofemoral joint diseases on functional outcomes and prosthesis survival in patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Patellofemoral joint (PFJ) diseases are chronic degenerative conditions that contribute to knee joint symptoms. Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is widely regarded as an effective treatment for knee osteoarthritis (KOA); however, its specific indications remain a subject of debate. Hypothesis Patients with PFJ disease are expected to experience outcomes post-UKA comparable to those of patients without PFJ disease. Methods We conducted this meta-analysis following the guidelines outlined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases was conducted for studies examining the association between PFJ disease and UKA, including publications up to September 2024. Extracted data encompassed author, publication year, country, disease type, prosthesis type, sample size, mean patient age, gender distribution, follow-up duration, PFJ disease prevalence at surgery, diagnostic methods, and whether PFJ disease was considered a contraindication for UKA. To maintain objectivity, only studies in which PFJ diseases were visually identifiable were included in the meta-analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 15.0 and Review Manager 5.4.1. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Knee Society Score (KSS), flexion range of motion (ROM), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), Tegner activity score, and prosthesis survival rate, with outcomes stratified by PFJ disease type (PFJ degeneration or patella cartilage injury). Mean differences, confidence intervals, and P values were calculated for comparisons between the PFJ disease and non-PFJ disease groups. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) were applied to evaluate the risk of bias. To address heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses were performed, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. Results A total of 14,866 knees from 48 relevant studies were included in this systematic review. Methodological quality was assessed using the MINORS criteria, with case series scoring 11.0/16 and cohort studies scoring 18.2/24. PFJ degeneration emerged as the most studied condition, followed by patella cartilage injury. Clinical outcomes assessments indicated that medial PFJ degeneration, anterior knee pain, patella cartilage damage, and patella baja did not significantly impact UKA outcomes or prosthesis survival. However, severe lateral PFJ degeneration, lateral patellar subluxation, lateral trochlear osteophytes, and patellar bone marrow edema did influence results. Fifteen high-quality studies were included in the meta-analysis, involving 6080 patients-1338 in the PFJ disease group and 4,742 in the non-PFJ disease group. With an average NOS score of 7.2, the studies were generally of high quality. Meta-analysis results showed no significant differences between groups in final follow-up OKS, FJS, Tegner activity score, or prosthesis survival rate. However, the PFJ disease group had lower KSS and reduced flexion ROM compared to the non-PFJ disease group. Subgroup analysis further revealed that the PFJ degeneration group scored lower than the patella cartilage injury group on OKS, KSS, and flexion ROM following UKA. Conclusion In summary, PFJ disease was found to have limited impact on UKA outcomes; however, caution is recommended for cases involving severe lateral PFJ degeneration due to potential restrictions in postoperative knee function, particularly affecting flexion ROM in UKA patients.

8ec8f1cc0c12fae84b8eeaa50f4721e77fa8c122,Bartonella quintana detection among arthropods and their hosts: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Bartonella quintana is a body louse-borne bacterium causing bacteremia and infective endocarditis. We aimed to describe B. quintana detection among arthropods and their hosts. Methods We searched databases in PubMed Central/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science from January 1, 1915 (the year of B. quintana discovery) to January 1, 2024, to identify publications containing specific search terms relating to B. quintana detection among arthropods. Descriptive statistics and meta-analysis of pooled prevalence using random-effects models were performed for all arthropods and body and head lice. Results Of 1265 records, 62 articles were included, describing 8839 body lice, 4962 head lice, and 1692 other arthropods, such as different species of fleas, bedbugs, mites, and ticks. Arthropods were collected from 37 countries, of which 28 had arthropods with B. quintana DNA. Among articles that reported B. quintana detection among individual arthropods, 1445 of 14,088 (0.1026, 95% CI [0.0976; 0.1077]) arthropods tested positive for B. quintana DNA, generating a random-effects model global prevalence of 0.0666 (95% CI [0.0426; 0.1026]). Fifty-six studies tested 8839 body lice, of which 1679 had B. quintana DNA (0.1899, 95% CI [0.1818; 0.1983]), generating a random-effects model pooled prevalence of 0.2312 (95% CI [0.1784; 0.2843]). Forty-two studies tested 4962 head lice, of which 390 head lice from 20 studies originating from 11 different countries had B. quintana DNA (0.0786, 95% CI [0.0713; 0.0864]). Eight studies detected B. quintana DNA exclusively on head lice. Five studies reported greater B. quintana detection on head lice than body lice; all originated from low-resource environments. Conclusions Bartonella quintana is a vector-borne bacterium with a global distribution, disproportionately affecting marginalized populations. Bartonella quintana DNA has been detected in many different arthropod species, though not all of these arthropods meet criteria to be considered vectors for B. quintana transmission. Body lice have long been known to transmit B. quintana . A limited number of studies suggest that head lice may also act as possible vectors for B. quintana in specific low-resource contexts.

ea31eb1439d2d8e45fde28faf6b5a8bb294b1d31,Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation: a bibliometric study on current research hotspots and status,"Background Transcutaneous Vagal Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) has been used as a promising noninvasive neuromodulation technique for the treatment of various systems.The aim of this study was to analyze the research hotspots and future directions of tVNS in the 21st century by using bibliometric methods. Methods The study object was the literature related to tVNS from the Web of Science database from 2000 to May 2024. In order to measure and analyze the number of literature issuance, institutions, authors, countries, keywords, co-citations, and journals of publication, we used VOSviewer, Citespace, Bibliometrix R-package, and Scimago Graphica software. A narrative review of the current research content of tVNS was conducted to gain a better understanding of the current state of the field. Results A total of 569 papers were included in the study. The results show that from 2000 to 2024, the number of publications shows an increasing trend year by year, involving a total of 326 research institutions. The United States, China, and Germany are the major research centers. The study identified 399 keywords, which roughly formed 11 natural clusters, revealing that the current hotspots of related research are mainly reflected in 3 areas: intervention efficacy on nervous system diseases, mechanism of action of tVNS, and stimulation mode of tVNS. The top 10 most cited references focus on research into the mechanism of action of tVNS. Conclusion The efficacy and safety of tVNS have been confirmed in previous studies, but a standardized tVNS treatment protocol has not yet been developed, and most clinical studies have small sample sizes and lack multicenter and multidisciplinary collaboration. Currently, tVNS is used in the treatment of neurological diseases, psychiatric diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and some autoimmune diseases. It is expected that future research in this field will continue to focus on the application of tVNS in central nervous system diseases and the exploration of related mechanisms, and at the same time, with the rise of non-invasive neuromodulation technology, the application of tVNS in other diseases also has great potential for development.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,2024.0,4,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2024.1406135', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11363710, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

46d128ac7515e956aefe35e04d46735153440bd8,The role of antibiotic exposure as risk factor for IBD epidemic: an updated meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM
The rising prevalence of IBD globally has raised concerns about antibiotic exposure. This study's meta-analysis examines antibiotic exposure, frequency, year before diagnosis, regional differences, and IBD incidence.


METHODS
The literature review used PubMed, Web of Science, Elsevier, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases up to June 2024 to explore the link between antibiotic exposure and IBD risk. Stratified analysis was conducted by years of antibiotic exposure before IBD diagnosis, frequency, and region. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were combined using a random effects model.


RESULTS
Eighteen case-control studies and five cohort studies were included (n = 99, 104 IBD patients and n = 2 273 336 controls). The findings indicate that antibiotic exposure significantly has a positive association with the risk of developing IBD (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.28-2.16). Antibiotic exposure of ≥3 years (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.12-1.98), 2 years (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.37-1.55), and ≤1 year (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.17-2.04) prior to the diagnosis of IBD is associated with a higher risk of developing IBD. Cumulative exposure of ≥3 dispensations (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.49-2.74) and two dispensations (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.03-1.78) also had a positive association with IBD risk, while one dispensation did not (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.72-1.26). No significant association was found in developing countries (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.71-5.19), but developed countries showed a significant positive association with the risk (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.27-1.96).


CONCLUSION
The meta-analysis suggests that antibiotic use has a positive association with the risk of IBD, and limiting unnecessary antibiotic use may be one way to reduce the risk of developing IBD.",Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,2024.0,4,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jgh.16751', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/jgh.16751?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.16751, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This report explores the prevalence of these viruses in Iran through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: The present survey was performed with a systematic review and meta-analysis method on the seroprevalence of WNV, CHIKV, and DENV using the ELISA test. Based on this, by search in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, and Google Scholar scientific databases, all relevant published papers were sorted out and reviewed. Power ratification of data was carried out with a random effects model in meta-analysis, meta-regression, I2 index, and Egger test. Results: Twelve published papers between 2000 and 2024 were embodied in this meta-analysis report. The seroprevalence of positive ELISA test for WNV in Iran was estimated at 12.9% (CI=95%: 7.4-18.4), and for CHIKV at 6.2% (CI=95%: 0.6-11.8). Regarding DENV, only two studies were conducted with a zero prevalence in one study, and a seroprevalence of 5.6% in another study. Conclusion: According to these data, WNV, CHIKV, and DENV fevers have been detected in Iran using ELISA test. Considering the seropositivity of WNV and CHIKV, and the finding of these viruses from several provinces, it could be for granted that these two viruses are ubiquitous and DENV fever is sporadic in Iran.

A company’s proactive role in ensuring its employees’ resilience to stress in the workplace is crucial in creating an effective working environment and reducing staff turnover. The article analyses the scientific environment (using Descriptive bibliometric analysis and Science Mapping) and public interest (using Google Trends) in resilience and stress at professional work and in management in this area. The bibliometric analysis was conducted using VOSviewer based on publications from the Scopus database (Elsevier) without restrictions on the year of publication, country, author, language and category; the trend analysis was conducted for the period 2004‒2024 for all categories and countries, all Internet traffic was restricted to “Web searches”. The study showed a steady increase in Internet searches for the concept of “resilience training”, with peaks in 2004 and 2005 (coinciding with known terrorist attacks); interest in the query “resilience at professional work” is highest in the United States and the United Kingdom, and 12 leading countries were identified for the query “stress at professional work”. The dynamics of scientific papers in this area are described in the article by a 3rd-degree polynomial dependence equation with a determination coefficient of R² = 0.9676; a significant surge in publication activity occurred in 2014, with the number of papers increasing by 472% and an annual growth rate of 20% in 2014‒2024. The dominant subject areas of these publications are medicine (34.50%), social sciences (15.08%) and psychology (14.47%); countries are the USA, the UK, Australia, Canada, and China. The article identifies scientists who are leaders of scientific thought in this area, the most developed research networks, authoritative publications and journals (based on citation analysis), the most powerful international and national institutions that have funded research in this area (among the world leaders are the US National Institutes of Health and the US Department of Defence). The article structures the scientific work in this area: 1) based on the content and contextual feature, nine thematic clusters are identified, the most significant of which is the one that studies stress at work and professional burnout from a medical point of view; 2) based on the content and chronological feature, the most significant number of works were those on the human factor and gender issues of stress and resilience published in 2017‒2018.",Business Ethics and Leadership,2024.0,3,"{'url': 'https://armgpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BEL_8_2_2024_9.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.61093/bel.8(2).128-151.2024?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.61093/bel.8(2).128-151.2024, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods: The evolution and thematic trends of the application of inorganic nanomaterials to autoimmune diseases from January 1, 1985, to March 15, 2024, were analyzed by bibliometric analysis of data retrieved and extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. A total of 734 relevant reports in the literature were evaluated according to specific characteristics such as year of publication, journal, institution, country/region, references, and keywords. VOSviewer was used to build co-authorship analysis, co-occurrence analysis, co-citation analysis, and network visualization. Some important subtopics identified by bibliometric characterization are further discussed and reviewed. Result: From 2009 to 2024, annual publications worldwide increased from 11 to 95, an increase of 764%. ACS Nano published the most papers (14) with the most citations (1372). China (230 papers, 4922 citations) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (36 papers, 718 citations) are the most productive and influential country and institution, respectively. The first 100 keywords were co-clustered to form four clusters: (1) the application of inorganic nanomaterials in drug delivery, (2) the application of inorganic nano-biosensing to autoimmune diseases, (3) the use of inorganic nanomaterials for imaging applied to autoimmune diseases, and (4) the application of inorganic nanomaterials in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Combination therapy, microvesicles, photothermal therapy (PTT), targeting, diagnostics, transdermal, microneedling, silver nanoparticles, psoriasis, and inflammatory cytokines are the latest high-frequency keywords, marking the emerging frontier of inorganic nanomaterials in the field of autoimmune diseases. Sub-topics were further discussed to help researchers determine the scope of research topics and plan research directions. Conclusion: Over the past 39 years, the application of inorganic nanotechnology to the field of autoimmune diseases shows extensive cooperation between countries and institutions, showing a continuous increase in the number of reports in the literature, and has clinical translation prospects.

7066716e5772429c6319b7a890770f0d18118dde,Prevalence of Tobacco Products’ Use and Associated Factors Among Adolescents in Morocco: A Systematic Review,"Introduction: Tobacco use is the major preventable cause of premature death worldwide, responsible for about 8 million deaths per year, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, such as Morocco. Adolescents’ tobacco use is a matter of concern, because early initiation increases the risk of becoming a lifelong user. There exists a notable gap in the synthesis of evidence concerning tobacco use among Moroccan adolescents. Thus, the purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive view of the prevalence of tobacco products’ use and associated factors among adolescents in Morocco. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect for relevant studies reporting prevalence rates of tobacco products’ use among Moroccan adolescents, published until June 2024, using inclusion and exclusion criteria in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Additional searches were completed on other sources to reach unpublished reports. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist was used to assess the quality of included studies. Results: After the final screening, 22 papers met the inclusion criteria. Life-time prevalence of tobacco use ranged from 7.8% to 20.4% for cigarettes smoking, from 10.6% to 21.9% for waterpipe, from 7.9% to 9.1% for chewing tobacco and from 9.2% to 12.4% for snuff. The last 12-month prevalence of cigarette smoking was comprised between 6.9% and 10.8%. As for the prevalence of current use, ranges of (1.8%-16.4%) and (4.9%-8.4%) were noted for cigarettes and waterpipe, respectively. The most commonly highlighted risk factors for tobacco use included male sex, older age, having friends or family members who use tobacco and low perception of risk associated with tobacco use. Conclusion: Our findings reveal an alarming situation of tobacco use among Moroccan adolescents. Therefore, it is crucial that all stakeholders engage in concerted efforts to develop and implement evidence-based preventive interventions among early adolescents.",Substance use : research and treatment,2024.0,3,"{'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11339743', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11339743, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d76df84e5870d63e4595d921f217eef5137c3ba0,"Origin, transformation and classification of organic soils in Poland","The Soil Science Society of Poland has selected organic soils (in Polish: gleby organiczne ) as their Soil of the Year 2024 . Organic soils consist of materials that contain ≥ 12% organic carbon (C), and include peat, gyttja and mud materials, as well as forest (leaf and woody debris) or meadow (grass debris) litter ( ≥ 20% organic C if saturated with water for <30 consecutive days a year). The speci ﬁ c properties of these soils, primarily the high organic C content, low bulk density and high porosity values, determine their disaggregation from mineral soils. In the 6 th edition of the Polish Soil Clas-si ﬁ cation (SGP 6), four main types of organic soils were distinguished: peat soils (in Polish: gleby torfowe ), mursh soils (in Polish: gleby murszowe ), limnic soils (in Polish: gleby limnowe ) and folisols (in Polish: gleby ś ció ł kowe ). The estimated cover of organic soils in Poland ranges from 4 to 5% of the land surface, located mainly in closed depressions and river valleys; an exception are the folisols that mainly occur in mountain areas. Among organic soils, peat and mursh soils cover the largest area and are mainly used for agricultural purposes. Organic soils are considered the largest natural terrestrial reservoir of organic C, but disturbance to peatlands from climate change and human activities has impacted their C storage potential.

This paper aims to analyze the global research landscape of post-stroke depression (PSD) between the years 1900 to 2024 using bibliometric analysis. Methods The data used in this analysis was collected from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). An advanced search was performed using the keywords, “stroke” and “depression,” on July 8th, 2024. From the Web of Science, bibliometric data was then extracted and analyzed in VOSviewer through four categories: countries, number of publications, keywords, and journals. Results The bibliometric analysis resulted in 2,289 publications from the year 1900 to 2024. A gradual increase in the number of publications on post-stroke depression over the study period was observed. China was found to be the leading country for publications and funding on PSD, with the United States following in second. The top keywords included: “stroke,” “depression,” and “poststroke depression.” The Journal of Stroke had the highest number of publications on depression in post-stroke patients. Conclusion This study provides an overview of the current trends in articles published on PSD. Depression is an important topic to be considered in post-stroke patients due to its negative effects on post-stroke recovery and reduced quality of life, necessitating a call to attention and support for future research in this field.

Method Retrieval of relevant literature from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The search period ranged from the starting year to January 7, 2024. Subsequently, literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment will be conducted, and data analysis will be performed using ""Review Manager 5.4"" software. Result Overall, SEM has a positive and statistically significant impact on the basic psychological needs (MD = 0.36,95% CI [0.22, 0.50]) and intrinsic motivation (MD = 0.75, 95% CI [0.58, 0.93]) of adolescent students (P<0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed age effects on the impact of SEM on the basic psychological needs of adolescent students: pre-peak height velocity (PRE-PHV) (MD = 0.39, 95% CI [0.23, 0.56], I2 = 45%, P<0.01), mid-peak height velocity (MID-PHV) (MD = 0.22, 95% CI [0.01, 0.42], I2 = 82%, P<0.05), post-peak height velocity (POST-PHV) (MD = 1.27, 95% CI [0.79, 1.74], I2 = 0%, P<0.01). Similarly, age effects were found for intrinsic motivation: MID-PHV (MD = 0.86, 95% CI [0.62, 1.11], I2 = 68%, P<0.01), POST-PHV (MD = 0.56, 95% CI [0.40, 0.72], I2 = 0%, P<0.01). Conclusion The SEM is an effective approach to enhancing the basic psychological needs and intrinsic motivation of adolescent students. However, it exhibits age effects among students at different developmental stages. Specifically, in terms of enhancing basic psychological needs, the model has the greatest impact on POST-PHV students, followed by PRE-PHV students, while the improvement effect is relatively lower for MID-PHV students.

Treatment decisions for VS are based on factors including tumor size, hearing status, patient symptoms, and institutional preference. The study aimed to investigate long‐term auditory outcomes in VS patients undergoing active treatments with a hearing preservation intent. Data Sources A systematic literature review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines, searching Scopus, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases from inception to January 2024. Review Methods Studies meeting inclusion criteria, including a minimum 5‐year follow‐up and assessment of pre‐ and posttreatment hearing outcomes, were included. Pooled prevalence estimates for serviceable hearing after SRS and microsurgery were calculated using MetaXL software. Risk of bias assessment was performed with the Risk of Bias in Non‐randomized Studies of Interventions tool. Results Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, with 356 patients included for analysis. The pooled prevalence of maintaining serviceable hearing after SRS at 10 years was 18.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7%‐43.3%), with wide prediction intervals indicating variability in outcomes. Microsurgery demonstrated a higher prevalence of maintaining long‐term serviceable hearing, with a pooled estimate of 74.5% (95% CI: 63.5%‐84.1%). Conclusion This systematic review underscores the importance of long‐term follow‐up in evaluating auditory outcomes in VS treatment.

Cancer immunotherapy, a promising approach for HER2-positive and TNBC, still faces resistance hurdles. Recently, numerous studies have set their sights on the resistance of immunotherapy for breast cancer. Our study provides a thorough comprehension of the current research landscape, hotspots, and emerging breakthroughs in this critical area through a meticulous bibliometric analysis. As of March 26, 2024, a total of 1341 articles on immunology resistance in breast cancer have been gathered from Web of Science Core Collection, including 765 articles and 576 reviews. Bibliometrix, CiteSpace and VOSviewer software were utilized to examine publications and citations per year, prolific countries, contributive institutions, high-level journals and scholars, as well as highly cited articles, references and keywords. The research of immunotherapy resistance in breast cancer has witnessed a remarkable surge over the past seven years. The United States and China have made significant contributions, with Harvard Medical School being the most prolific institution and actively engaging in collaborations. The most contributive author is Curigliano, G from the European Institute of Oncology in Italy, while Wucherpfennig, K. W. from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in the USA, had the highest citations. Journals highly productive primarily focus on clinical, immunology and oncology research. Common keywords include “resistance”, “expression”, “tumor microenvironment”, “cancer”, “T cell”, “therapy”, “chemotherapy” and “cell”. Current research endeavors to unravel the mechanisms of immune resistance in breast cancer through the integration of bioinformatics, basic experiments, and clinical trials. Efforts are underway to develop strategies that improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy, including the exploration of combination therapies and advancements in drug delivery systems. Additionally, there is a strong focus on identifying novel biomarkers that can predict patient response to immunology. This study will provide researchers with an up-to-date overview of the present knowledge in drug resistance of immunology for breast cancer, serving as a valuable resource for informed decision-making and further research on innovative approaches to address immunotherapy resistance.",Frontiers in Immunology,2024.0,2,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1452303', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11345160, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To examine the effect of exercise during the first year postpartum on pelvic floor disorders and diastasis recti abdominis.


DESIGN
Systematic review with random effects meta-analysis.


DATA SOURCES
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscuss, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched until 12 January 2024.


ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES
Studies of all designs (except case studies) and languages were included if they contained information on the Population (individuals in the first year postpartum), Intervention (subjective or objective measures of frequency, intensity, duration, volume or type of exercise alone ('exercise-only') or in combination with other intervention (eg, biofeedback; 'exercise+co-intervention')), Comparator (no exercise or different exercise measures) and Outcome (symptom severity and risk of urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, diastasis recti abdominis and sexual function).


RESULTS
65 studies (n=21 334 participants) from 24 countries were included. 'Moderate' certainty of evidence revealed that pelvic floor muscle training reduced the odds of urinary incontinence by 37% (seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs), n=1930; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.97, I2 72%) and pelvic organ prolapse by 56% (one RCT, n=123; OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.91) compared with control groups. 'Low' certainty of evidence showed a greater reduction in inter-rectus distance measured at rest and during a head lift following abdominal muscle training compared with no exercise. Evidence on the effect of exercise on the risk of anal incontinence and diastasis recti abdominis, as well as the severity of anal incontinence, urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse and sexual function, is limited.


CONCLUSION
Evidence supports the effectiveness of postpartum pelvic floor muscle training in reducing the odds of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse and postpartum abdominal exercise training in reducing inter-rectus distance.

The review followed the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley for conducting scoping reviews. The databases searched included CINHAL, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and grey literature databases. Additional articles were identified through cited references of the studies included. A data extraction template was used to retrieve relevant text. A narrative synthesis approach was adopted to explore the relationships within and between the included studies. Results The literature search yielded 4658 studies. Among these, 817 were identified as duplicates, and 3740 were excluded after screening. Only twenty-one articles met the criteria for inclusion in the review. The findings showed that healthcare workers have insufficient knowledge of child and adolescent mental health, hold negative attitudes toward children and adolescents with mental health problems, and exhibit poor practices related to child and adolescent mental health. Conclusion It is crucial to build capacity and improve healthcare workers’ practices, knowledge, and attitudes toward child and adolescent mental health in sub-Saharan Africa. This could lead to better access to mental health services for children and adolescents in the region.

Over the past half-century, the chiropractic profession has seen increased utilization in the United States following Medicare authorization for payment of chiropractic SMT in 1972. We reviewed chiropractic research trends since that year and recent clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations regarding SMT. We searched Scopus for articles associated with chiropractic (spanning 1972–2024), analyzing publication trends and keywords, and searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for CPGs addressing SMT use (spanning 2013–2024). We identified 6286 articles on chiropractic. The rate of publication trended upward. Keywords initially related to historical evolution, scope of practice, medicolegal, and regulatory aspects evolved to include randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. We identified 33 CPGs, providing a total of 59 SMT-related recommendations. The recommendations primarily targeted low back pain (n = 21) and neck pain (n = 14); of these, 90% favored SMT for low back pain while 100% favored SMT for neck pain. Recent CPG recommendations favored SMT for tension-type and cervicogenic headaches. There has been substantial growth in the number and quality of chiropractic research articles over the past 50 years, resulting in multiple CPG recommendations favoring SMT.

A systematic search for relevant studies was conducted using research databases. Twenty-four quantitative studies were yielded from 1684 records on the association between family variables and CA that were published between 1981 and 2024. Two researchers conducted data extraction independently, following coding standards. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3.3 was used in this study. The result showed that PCB support demonstrated a moderately significant correlation with CA and the largest effect size (r = 0.325). A non-significant result was found only for the correlation between PCB interference and CA. Except for gender, the moderating effects of region, age, CA measure, and publication year were found in the relationship between some family variables and CA. One limitation is the restricted range of the samples due to few studies investigating samples from regions other than Asia. The findings can highlight future directions for family studies and career research and hold practical implications for institutes, companies, and communities related to career development.

Experimenting with various modes of digital hanging out, I began to paint the computer-mediated interactions (Svašek, 2023a, 2023b). The paintings explored the online relationality of pandemic life and were realized through concentrated bodily attention to the social dynamics of long-distance co-presence. While newly developed, the method of long-distance painting drew on pre-pandemic work by anthropologists who used sketching, painting, and graphic storytelling to reach broader audiences (Collordo-Mansfield, 1993; Afonso, 2004; Ramos, 2004, 2018; Causey, 2017; Dix, Kaur, 2019; Hurdley, 2019; Jain, 2021; Haapio-Kirk, Cearns, n.d.). 
About a year after the completion of the paintings, I began adding poetic reflections. Lockdown Friend explores an encounter with one of my friends in the Netherlands in 2020. The picture visualizes the momentary link between our distant homes, connecting the two locations through wavy pen strokes. The accompanying poem expresses the sense of frustration I felt because of our inability to physically meet, and the last stanza refers to the deeply disturbing situation in which the infection and mortality rates rapidly increased across the world.

Regardless of their disabilities, special needs children are entitled for a quality education. However, autism children face behaviour problems which block learning and teaching in classroom. Behaviour modification techniques among these children will help teachers and parents modify negative behaviours to enable positive learning environment. The aim of this paper is to analyse the behaviour modification practices for autism children. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) model is used to identify articles from the database of Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), Research Gate and Google Scholar. 115 articles were identified at initial stage regarding behaviour modification among autism children however only 16 articles were selected for this study. The selected articles are from the year of 2018 to 2024. The findings of the study were divided into four themes; ABA, PECS, social stories, and video modelling. Consistency and knowledge among special education teachers are important to practise behaviour modification in classroom. PECS, social stories, and ABA are frequently used behaviour modification practise while video modelling is least due to time constraints among special educators. In future, these techniques can be documented in easier manner to be practiced by teachers and parents on daily basis.",International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://hrmars.com/papers_submitted/21916/behaviour-management-among-autism-children-a-systematic-review.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.6007/ijarbss/v14-i6/21916?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v14-i6/21916, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

On occasion, this involves vehicles impacted by falling overhanging trees or branches. To study this phenomenon further review of the Forensic Science SA, Adelaide, Australia, database and an internet news search were undertaken over a 20 year period from March 2004 to February 2024 for all cases where unexpected accidental deaths in South Australia had been caused by falling branches or trees. There were six cases (age range 12-63 years; average 39 years; M:F 1:2). Three deaths occurred when branches dropped onto vehicles being driven along roads, 2 occurred when entire trees dropped onto the victims (one in windy weather) and 1 was due to a branch drop. Three tree species were identified as a grey box gum tree (Eucalyptus microcarpa), a lemon-scented gum tree (Corymbia citriodora) and a Cottonwood tree (Populus deltoides). The remainder were variants of eucalyptus (gum) trees. Deaths due to tree failures are uncommon and may involve a variety of different tree species with these events not necessarily occurring during high winds or storms.

To summarise pooled estimates of the efficacies of various myopia control interventions, as drawn from published meta-analyses.


METHOD
PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science were searched from inception to February 2024 for systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting treatment effects of various myopia control strategies. The qualities of the included meta-analyses were assessed using the 16-item A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2. An intervention was defined as having a clinically significant effect if it resulted in a change in spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of ≥0.50 D/year or axial length (AL) change of ≤-0.18 mm/year.


RESULTS
A total of 38 studies were identified. The overall respective changes in SER and AL, mean difference (95% CI) were high-concentration (≥0.5%) atropine 0.67 D (0.58-0.77) and -0.24 mm (-0.36 to -0.11); moderate-concentration (>0.05% to <0.5%) atropine 0.48 D (0.34-0.62) and -0.23 mm (-0.27 to -0.19); low-concentration (0.01%, 0.025%, 0.05%) atropine 0.33 D (0.23-0.43) and -0.14 mm (-0.19 to -0.09); orthokeratology -0.47 mm (-0.66 to -0.28); peripheral plus soft contact lenses 0.30 D (0.18-0.42) and -0.35 mm (-0.62 to -0.08); peripheral plus spectacles 0.77 D (0.40-1.14) and -0.43 mm (-0.78 to -0.08); multifocal spectacles 0.21 D (0.11-0.31); repeated low-level red light therapy 0.55 D (0.46-0.65) and -0.25 mm (-0.29 to -0.20); outdoor time 0.17 D (0.16-0.18) and -0.04 mm (-0.06 to -0.01).

Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant studies up to February 2, 2024. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and ICU mortality. The secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. The hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were combined to evaluate the associations between the TyG index and the above endpoints. All the statistical analyses were performed with STATA 15.0 software. Results: Ten studies involving 22,694 patients were included. The pooled results demonstrated that an elevated TyG index indicated an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (HR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.41–2.18, P < .001), ICU mortality (HR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.33–1.74, P < .001), 30-day mortality (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.02–2.19, P = .037), 90-day mortality (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.01–2.00, P = .043), and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.11–1.28, P < .001). Subgroup analysis for in-hospital mortality and ICU mortality based on sex, age, body mass index and hypertension showed similar results. However, subgroup analysis stratified by diabetes mellitus (DM) revealed that the associations of the TyG index with in-hospital mortality (HR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.30–3.78, P = .004) and ICU mortality (HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 0.95–3.94, P = .070) were observed only among patients without DM.

272dfe76cfb17167114712ad60737290caa8f019,Leadership and Climate Change Mitigation: A Systematic Literature Review,"This systematic literature review (SLR) explores leadership and climate change mitigation in cities. In doing so, it investigates explicit meanings of leadership, enablers of leadership, and leadership similarities and differences across regions. The review utilized three databases on 8 March 2024—Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science—curating an initial 496 results, resulting in 30 studies in the final analysis, using a two-reviewer screening process to limit bias and ensure consistency of approach. Inclusion criteria included English-language peer-reviewed articles over a ten-year period. The timeframe used was limited to January 2014 to December 2023 (10 years) to focus on the lead up to and post-implementation of the Paris Agreement. Further, empirical and conceptual studies were included to provide readers of this review with a thorough understanding of leadership work completed since 2014. Exclusion criteria included any studies that focus on adaptation measures and forms of leadership where the focus is on the private business, state, or national level, including leadership and climate change mitigation outside the influence of the local government. The study highlights five distinct meanings of leadership using the Braun and Clarke method of thematic analysis. It found leadership themes related to people (e.g., mayors), policy (e.g., ambitious climate plans), ideas (e.g., new concepts), collective action (e.g., motivating others), and mobilizing power (e.g., through regulations). The enablers of leadership included polycentricity, social capital influences, co-creational and mayor leadership, climate governance, and multi-actor coordination. This review segments the studies based on the findings from the literature, which focus on three continents (North America, Europe, and Asia) with a distinct difference in the meaning and enablers of leadership based on region.

dd56e2b7c338f7732c73b743229ad4eebbc355a6,CPR-Induced Consciousness during Ventricular Fibrillation: Case Report and Literature Review,"Introduction Over the years, numerous studies have suggested the occurrence of a peculiar phenomenon known as “CPRIC” during the revival process. The revelation of this phenomenon has ignited widespread discussion and investigation, yet many enigmas remain unsolved. This study describes the case of a 52-year-old man diagnosed with acute anterior myocardial infarction, who experienced ventricular fibrillation while awaiting further treatment. Despite ultimately not regaining spontaneous circulation, he remained conscious for a period during chest compressions and showed signs of resistance. Methods PubMed and Web of Science were searched until July 11, 2024. We included original studies and case reports relevant to CPRIC. For case reports, we extracted information on the author (year), country, patients, location, compression, signs of CPRIC, treatment of CPRIC, and patient outcomes. For other studies, we included the author (year), country, participants, and results. The extracted data were synthesized using a narrative approach. Results Of 3038 articles, 32 were included, i.e., 18 case reports (24 cases), 9 cross-sectional surveys, and 5 cohort studies. In CPRIC cases, patients exhibited various manifestations including opening their eyes, speaking, and moving. Other included studies explored healthcare workers' awareness and experiences of CPRIC, the incidence and manifestations of CPRIC, the impact of CPRIC on patient outcomes, memories and perceptions of cardiac arrest indicating consciousness, the effects of CPRIC on rescuers, and the management of CPRIC. Conclusions There is an urgent need to establish a globally recognized definition of CPRIC. It is crucial to develop clear algorithms that focus not only on identifying this phenomenon but also on determining the best approaches to manage it. Furthermore, CPRIC can cause multiple interruptions during CPR, making it essential to differentiate whether these interruptions are due to CPRIC or indicative of a return of spontaneous circulation.",Emergency Medicine International,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/2834376', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11455598, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Network (CNKI), Wanfang database, VIP, and Chinese Biomedical Literature databases with a search time limit of April 2024 for the year of construction, and included randomized controlled clinical trials of different modes of noninvasive respiratory support after extubation in NRDS. The primary outcome indicators were the need for re-tracheal intubation within 72 h of extubation on noninvasive ventilatory support and carbon dioxide retention (PCO2) 24 h after extubation. Secondary outcome indicators included the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), nasal injury, pneumothorax, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or periventricular white matter softening (PVL), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and mortality rate. A systematic review and network meta-analysis of the literature was performed by two investigators who screened, extracted, and evaluated the quality of the data. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were then performed using R software. Results A total of 23 studies involving 2,331 neonates were analyzed. These studies examined four noninvasive respiratory modalities: continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (NCPAP), noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (N-BiPAP), and noninvasive high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (NHFOV). Results indicated that NHFOV, NIPPV, and N-BiPAP were significantly more effective than NCPAP in reducing the risk of reintubation (all P < 0.05), with NHFOV being the most effective. For carbon dioxide clearance, NHFOV outperformed both NIPPV and NCPAP (P < 0.05). Regarding the reduction of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) incidence, NHFOV and NIPPV showed a significant advantage over NCPAP. Conclusions This network meta-analysis (NMA) suggested that NHFOV is the most effective mode of noninvasive respiratory support post-extubation, while NCPAP is the least effective. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number and quality of the studies included.

7e3765149164b920203529f57f8e1a96d467f6ec,Neutrophils in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: bridging preclinical insights to clinical prospects for improved therapeutic strategies.,"INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by a dismal five-year survival rate of less than 10%. Neutrophils are key components of the innate immune system, playing a pivotal role in the PDAC immune microenvironment.


AREAS COVERED
This review provides a comprehensive survey of the pivotal involvement of neutrophils in the tumorigenesis and progression of PDAC. Furthermore, it synthesizes preclinical and clinical explorations aimed at targeting neutrophils within the milieu of PDAC, subsequently proposing a conceptual framework to propel further inquiry focused on enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of PDAC through neutrophil-targeted strategies. PubMed and Web of Science databases were utilized for researching neutrophils in pancreatic cancer publications prior to 2024.


EXPERT OPINION
Neutrophils play roles in promoting tumor growth and metastasis in PDAC and are associated with poor prognosis. However, the heterogeneity and plasticity of neutrophils and their complex relationships with other immune cells and extracellular matrix also provide new insights for immunotherapy targeting neutrophils to achieve a better prognosis for PDAC.",Expert Review of Clinical Immunology,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1744666X.2024.2348605?needAccess=true', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/1744666X.2024.2348605?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666X.2024.2348605, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Two five-year funding cycles (2014-2019; 2019-2024) have occurred following peer review, and a third cycle (Phase 3) has just begun. A unique construct was mandated, consisting of 20 national teams in Phase I and 19 teams in Phase II (with research topics spanning from basic to clinical science to health resource systems) along with cross-cutting programs to support them. Responding to the needs of researchers within the CCNA teams, a unique sample of 1173 deeply phenotyped patients with various forms of dementia was accrued and studied over eight years (COMPASS-ND). In the second phase of funding (2019-2024), a national dementia prevention program (CAN-THUMBS UP) was set up. In a short time, this prevention program became a member of the World Wide FINGERS prevention consortium. In this article, the challenges, successes, and impacts of CCNA in Canada and internationally are discussed. Short-term deliverables have occurred, along with considerable promise of impacts in the longer term. The creation of synergy, networking, capacity building, engagement of people with lived experience, and economies of scale have contributed to the considerable success of CCNA by all measures.

86d0ec93bb576f4b9686158ec75ae063891a40e9,A critical review of dark tourism studies,"The topic of dark tourism emerged in the last three decades as tourism became more accessible. It allows forgotten history to be revised and transferred to the public. This study aims to restructure existing categorization regarding dark tourism and address the research gaps in dark tourism studies. We collected studies from international publication databases – Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We pre-processed the following data for each study: topic, authors’ location of university affiliation, study area, year of publication, top-cited articles, top productive journals in publishing dark tourism studies, keywords, and internality/externality of the author from the study area. With the current paper, we analysed review articles published from 1996 to 2024 (first quarter), applying qualitative methods. Based on these, a new analytical framework was generated. Furthermore, the connections between research topics were also analysed. The results of the analysis highlight specific research gaps in the literature on dark tourism and address poorly visible research fields in international journals, e.g. terrorism-related research, social media links of dark tourism, postcolonial contexts, or commemoration of communist past and heritage.

The increased risk of pregnancy complications in type 1 diabetes is mainly attributed to maternal hyperglycemia. However, it is unclear whether other potentially modifiable factors also contribute to risk in this population. We sought to assess whether high BMI and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) are associated with perinatal complications in type 1 diabetes.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We searched Medline, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases to January 2024. Studies examining associations between periconception BMI or GWG and perinatal complications in type 1 diabetes were included. We used a predesigned data extraction template to extract study data including year, country, sample size, participants' characteristics, exposure, and outcomes. We included 29 studies (18,965 pregnancies; 1978-2019) in the meta-analysis.


RESULTS
A 1 kg/m2/1 kg increase in preconception BMI or GWG was associated with a 3% and 11% increase, respectively, in perinatal complications (BMI odds ratio [OR] 1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.06]; GWG OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.04-1.18]). Preconception BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 or excessive GWG was associated with a 22% and 50% increase, respectively, in perinatal complications (BMI OR 1.22 [95% CI 1.11-1.34]; GWG OR 1.50 [95% CI 1.31-1.73]). BMI was associated with congenital malformation, preeclampsia, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Excessive GWG was associated with preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, large for gestational age, and macrosomia.


CONCLUSIONS
Addressing maternal BMI prepregnancy and preventing excessive GWG should be key clinical priorities to improve outcomes in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.",Diabetes Care,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://diabetesjournals.figshare.com/articles/figure/_b_Associations_of_High_Body_Mass_Index_and_Excessive_Gestational_Weight_Gain_with_Pregnancy_Outcomes_in_Women_with_Type_1_Diabetes_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-analysis_b_/26311525/1/files/47716120.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2337/dc24-0725?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-0725, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This review aims to analyze the applications and risks associated with using LLMs in this specialized field. Materials and Methods: This systematic review was performed in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, incorporating elements from the diagnostic test accuracy extension and the CHARMS checklist for reviews of prediction models. A systematic literature search was executed on July 17, 2024, across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. We focused on identifying original research that integrates LLMs with gynecologic oncology. We assessed the risk of bias using the adapted QUADAS-2 criteria. Results: Our search identified eight studies that met our criteria, focusing on healthcare education, clinical practice, and medical code generation. These studies revealed variability in ChatGPT's performance across different applications. It excelled in genetic testing and counseling, achieving 97% accuracy rate. However, its performance in cervical cancer prevention was less robust, with an accuracy of 83%. While one study demonstrated ChatGPT's high adherence to quality guidelines, another noted that established guidelines significantly outperformed ChatGPT's outputs. Additionally, code generation using tools like Google Bard and RoBERTa have shown potential to improve accuracy in clinical predictions and quality assurance. For example, Natural Language Processing (NLP) assisted by RoBERTa (based on Google's BERT model) has improved the prediction of residual disease in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer following cytoreductive surgery. Despite these advancements, challenges related to consistency, specificity, and personalization persist, underscoring the necessity for continuous enhancement of these technologies.

A preliminary study at MI Ar-Rochmah revealed a significant deficiency in the reading comprehension abilities of fourth-grade students. The limited understanding of reading materials provided by teachers renders most students unable to answer essay questions or summarize the text effectively. Consequently, researchers endeavor to enhance students' reading comprehension skills during school learning activities by implementing the Predict, Organize, Rehearse, Practice, Evaluate (PORPE) learning strategy. This research employs a quantitative approach utilizing a quasi-experimental method. The research design employed a Non-equivalent Control Group Design, with the research population comprising all sixth-grade students in classes VI A and VI B at MI Ar-Rochmah Lembang during the 2023/2024 academic year. Data collection techniques included pretest-posttest description questions and observation sheets documenting teacher and student activities. Analysis of the research results through a t-test hypothesis test revealed a significance value (2-tailed) of 0.000, which is less than 0.05, leading to the rejection of H0 and acceptance of H1. These findings suggest a significant disparity in the average reading comprehension scores between students who received instruction utilizing the PORPE strategy and those taught using the DLTA strategy. Consequently, it can be inferred that the PORPE strategy effectively enhances the reading comprehension skills of sixth-grade students at MI Ar-Rochmah.",Attadrib Jurnal Pendidikan Guru Madrasah Ibtidaiyah,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://jurnal.insida.ac.id/index.php/attadrib/article/download/618/367', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.54069/attadrib.v7i1.618?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.54069/attadrib.v7i1.618, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5d583ee32b7f72c88078f2ddbdf22bc9e65a5dbe,Effect of testosterone formulations on hematocrit in transgender individuals: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND
Approximately, 11% of trans men experience erythrocytosis diagnosis due to testosterone administration during the first year of the gender-affirming hormone treatment (GAHT).


OBJECTIVES
To identify and compare the effect of different testosterone formulations on hematocrit (Hct) and diagnose erythrocytosis in trans men.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This systematic review was based on PRISMA guidelines. We performed an electronic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science in January 2024. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the quality of evidence in the observational studies.


RESULTS
Of the 152 records retrieved, 18 met the eligibility criteria. Studies observed an increase of up to 5% in Hct in trans men using injectable testosterone undecanoate (TU), and up to 6.9% in trans men using intermediate injectable testosterone esters (TE). Trans men using TE experience a larger increase in serum Hct levels compared to those receiving TU. Erythrocytosis prevalence varies according to the cutoff used (50%, 52%, and 54%). Erythrocytosis was also associated with tobacco use, age at initiation of hormone therapy, body mass index (BMI), and pulmonary conditions. Studies that evaluated the effect of testosterone formulation on erythrocytosis diagnosis present conflicting result. Trans men have a hazard ratio of 7.4 (95% CI: 4.1, 13.4) of developing erythrocytosis compared to cisgender men, using a 52% hematocrit cutoff.


CONCLUSION
All testosterone formulations result in an increase in Hct, irrespective of dose, formulation, and administration method. Smoking, higher age at initiation of the testosterone therapy, higher BMI, and a predisposing medical history are associated with this increase in Hct. The difference in effect of TE and TU on Hct is conflicting, although it is important to point out that these data come from observational studies, retrospective, and with a small-sample size.",Andrology,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/andr.13695?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.13695, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

17efbef5b967a9d0cb6b6e4d8dfe19495cf209f4,A meta-analytic review of the relation between spatial anxiety and spatial skills.,"Spatial skills are key predictors of achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, despite being acquired through everyday life and not formally taught in schools. Spatial skills include a diverse group of abilities broadly related to reasoning about properties of space such as distance and direction. Recently, more research has investigated the link between spatial skills and spatial anxiety, defined as a fear or apprehension felt when engaged in spatial thinking. There has yet to be a meta-analytic review summarizing these findings. Thus, the goal of this preregistered meta-analytic review is to provide an estimate of the size of the relation between spatial anxiety and spatial skills while considering several moderators (grade/age group, sex, spatial skills measure/subtype, spatial anxiety measure/subtype, geographical region of sample, publication type/year, and risk of bias). Analyzing 283 effect sizes accumulated from research conducted between 1994 and 2020, we found a small, negative, and statistically significant (r = -.14) correlation between spatial anxiety and spatial skills. Results showed that effect sizes including mental manipulation anxiety, scalar comparison anxiety, and navigation skill were often significantly stronger than effect sizes including measures of other subtypes. The magnitude of the relation was not significantly different in children and adults, though effect sizes tended to be weaker for younger samples (r = -.08). Our results are consistent with previous findings of a significant relation between spatial anxiety and skills, and this work bridges a gap in the existing research, lending support to future research efforts investigating spatial cognition.

In this context, it appears fitting to reconsider the legacy of this iconic individual, whose life journey serves as a compelling testament to the challenging process of shaping and advancing the principles upon which the trial currently rests. The aim of this study is to uncover the attributes of the present-day incorporation of A. F. Koni’s moral and ethical principles within the domestic legal framework. Research methods. This study was based on general scientific methods (analysis and synthesis, etc.) and methods of legal science (historical-legal, formal-legal). The study is based on the theoretical works of domestic specialists who have studied the A. F. Koni’s legacy. Study results. The moral concepts of A. F. Koni were formulated in the Constitution of the Russian Federation, wherein the fundamental tenets of administration of justice are enumerated: independence, irremovability, inviolability of judges, and openness of court proceedings. Moreover, the judge’s moral and ethical requirements coined by A. F. Koni were mirrored in the Law of the Russian Federation No. 3132-1 on the Status of Judges in the Russian Federation dated 26 June 1992. The Code of Judicial Ethics adopted in 2012 gains particular importance in the context of the analysis of A. F. Koni’s legacy. This document consistently and comprehensively outlines the principles of professional conduct for judges, as well as their involvement in activities pertaining to the advancement of law and legislation, implementation of legal practice, etc. It appears imperative to conduct further examination of A.

5bce5839efa555cf8a0251861a39ad1bb9162d88,Role of mast cells in the pathogenesis of oral submucous fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSMF) is an oral potentially malignant disorder (OPMD) that commonly occurs in the South Asian population as there is high usage of areca nut. There has been extensive research on the pathogenesis and treatment of this condition. It is well-established in the scientific literature that mast cells (MC) have a definitive role in several inflammatory disorders. OSMF being a chronic inflammatory disorder, is also expected to have increased MCs. Hence, this review aims to evaluate the role of MCs in the pathogenesis of OSMF. Methods A systematic search of articles was performed by two of the authors independently in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using the appropriate keywords and Boolean terms. The risk of bias was assessed using the Modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The meta-analysis was performed with R studio software (Version: 4.4.0, Year: 2024, Company: The R foundation for statistical computing). Results The search retrieved 36 studies, of which 16 were suitable for the review. There is evidence for a marked increase in the number of MCs in OSMF than the normal mucosa upon analyzing the retrieved articles. However, when comparing the grades of OSMF, there are variations in the reports. As all the retrieved articles were case-control studies, the risk of bias was analyzed using the Modified New Castle Ottawa Scale. All the studies scored in the good category (Score 6–9). The pooled effect size shows the Standard Mean Deviation (SMD) to be 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.18;0.37] to lie on either side of no effect.

Conducted at Mindanao Mission Academy during the 2023-2024 school year, the study utilized 362 Grade 12 students, including 118 males and 184 females, enrolled in the Accountancy, Business, and Management (ABM); Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS); and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) strands. During the work immersion exposure, students were required to complete an 80-hour work immersion at various partner institutions aligned with their strand, performing department-related tasks and working 8 hours a day. The demographic distribution aligns with national trends showing higher female enrolment in secondary education. Work immersion performance was assessed through self-ratings and supervisor ratings, indicating that students generally perceived their performance as outstanding. Notably, males and females differed significantly in self-ratings (p = 0.032), with males rating themselves higher compared to females. However, no significant differences were found in supervisor-rated performance across genders. Pairwise comparisons of self-ratings across strands indicated no significant difference between ABM and HUMSS students, while STEM students rated themselves significantly higher than both ABM and HUMSS students. In contrast, supervisor ratings showed ABM students performing significantly better than HUMSS and STEM students, highlighting a perceived performance hierarchy. The correlation analysis between self-ratings and supervisor ratings (r = -0.008, p = 0.891) revealed no significant linear relationship, indicating that supervisors' perspectives lean towards the company's needs, while students' perspectives lean towards their self-improvements. The findings suggest the need for gender-sensitive educational interventions and strand-specific support to enhance student self-assessment accuracy and work immersion preparedness. Additionally, educators and policymakers can provide a more effective educational experience by preparing students to be career-ready and effective in the workplace. These results have implications for educational policy and practice, aimed at better equipping students for their future careers.",International journal of science and management studies,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.51386/25815946/ijsms-v7i3p116', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': 'publisher-specific-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.51386/25815946/ijsms-v7i3p116?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.51386/25815946/ijsms-v7i3p116, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

96c53b3c65490d1149a20105ca2faf9dcd2765e4,Acute and chronic effects of stretching on balance – A systematic review with multilevel meta-analysis,"Introduction 
One-third of individuals over the age of 65 fall at least once per year. Lacroix et al. (2017) shows that supervised strength training improves balance and muscle strength, which might beneficially impact the risk of falls. The American Geriatrics Society and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommend resistance training to improve balance (McMurdo, 2002). However, administrative burden such as limited mobility can reduce engagement among older adults for common training routines and call for the development of alternatives, but no review has investigated whether stretching has acute or chronic effects on balance. 
Purpose 
Since recent studies pointed out that high volumes of stretch could be used interchangeable with resistance training, but can be safely used without supervision (Warneke et al., 2024), this systematic review with meta-analysis investigate the effects of stretching on balance parameters across the lifespan. 
Methods 
PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were screened for (randomized) controlled trials (RCTs) on acute and chronic stretching effects, with subgroup analyses for a) stretching types, and b) different balance tasks, e.g., standing as still as possible on a force plate to measure the center of pressure (CoP) with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed, as well as Y-balance and star excursion test were conducted. We assessed risk of bias, while certainty of evidence was assessed in accordance with the GRADE working group guidelines. Statistical calculations were performed with R (version 4.2.3). Effect sizes (ES) were quantified using the packages Robumeta and Meta. 
Results 
Out of 18 acute studies, 15 compared acute stretching effects to passive control, while 4 performed comparisons to an active control, resulting in small magnitude effects on CoP/Sway EO (ES: 0.21, p = 0.03). Out of eleven chronic studies, seven had passive control, and 5 an active control group, resulting in moderate balance improvements with ES reaching 0.63, p = 0.04 for CoP/Sway EO. The remaining effects remained unsignificant (p = 0.091 - 1). 
Discussion 
While flexibility is commonly performed to enhance flexibility, it can also positively impact balance in some conditions. While our research question was derived via the positive association between strength and balance (Muehlbauer et al., 2015), and the possibility to use high volume stretching to enhance strength (Warneke et al., 2024), neither used included studies stretching durations of sufficient length, nor was strength measured as an outcome. It is noteworthy that most of the included studies did not interpret stretching effects in the light of underlying physiology, but on a more phenomenological basis, making a final conclusion about potential mechanisms complicated. 
Conclusion 
Although our results indicated beneficial effects of stretching on balance in some subgroup analyses, underlying mechanisms remain speculative, yet. There is a dearth of high-quality randomized controlled studies, using reasonable stretching times to enhance strength and muscle size via stretch to check whether there is the potential to use stretch-mediated hypertrophy and strength increases as a viable alternative to common resistance training and balance programs when aiming to enhance balance.

Frankenstein's Plants aims to engage both children and the wider public with the work of herbaria, highlighting the Herbarium at RBGE. We first took part in 2019, and continued in 2023 and 2024.
 The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh is a well-known and loved location for visitors and local residents, attracting large numbers of people throughout the year. However, the work of the Herbarium is less well-known and many visitors, including residents, are unaware of the Herbarium collection.
 The aims of the event include:
 
 
 
 Raising awareness of the herbarium at RGBE, and how it is used by scientists globally
 
 
 Educating people on how specimens are made
 
 
 Introducing the idea of a scientific name and how it is constructed

 Frankenstein's Plants takes participants through the 'life' of a specimen, starting with the selection of material for mounting, through to the digitisation of the specimen, contributing to a virtual herbarium. Participants are encouraged to let their imagination go wild and create a monster (or whatever else they feel like) using the material provided. The event is laid out with a series of stations where staff talk through and support each step of the process (Fig. 1).
 The key steps of specimen creation for this event are:
 
 
 
 Select plant material: pressed and dried prior to the event, using flowers and foliage bought from an online florist, alongside material gathered from the gardens at RBGE.
 
 
 Mount the specimen: a pre-printed label is attached to a piece of board. The boards we use are approximately A4, allowing enough room for participants to create their creatures. Gummed tape is used to fix the plant material to the sheets, as a relatively low-mess option. The label provides space for recording the species name, a description and ‘collector’ information. Some locality information and a barcode is prefilled. The details on the label aim to give the participant an idea of the types of data that would typically be recorded when collecting.
 
 
 Name the specimen: participants can create their own name for their specimen. A list of options for the genus and species is provided and consists of both real and made-up genera and species epithets. This is an opportunity for the team to talk about how plants are named using the binomial system, and the importance of Latin names for communicating about life on earth.
 
 
 Describe the specimen: basic botanical terms are provided alongside sketches to get the participants thinking about how species can be described. This step can be modified based on the age of the participant, bringing in more information and technical terms where appropriate.
 
 
 Stamp the specimen: whilst not a key part of the processing of a specimen, it is very much enjoyed by the participants! We have a mix of old stamps that were previously used on specimens that they can choose from.
 
 
 Digitise the specimen: the final step is to take a picture of the specimen. We have a copy stand and DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera to allow the participant to take a photo of their specimen. The participant scans the barcode, which we use for the file name and later to look up the newly-digitised specimen in the virtual herbarium. They then take the photo, using remote shutter release triggered by a fixed mouse. The laptop is connected to a big screen, so everyone can see the image of their specimen.

 Following the event all the images are uploaded to a Flickr gallery, which acts as our virtual herbarium. A link to this gallery is provided on the label, allowing participants to look up their specimen online, as well as providing an approximate count of participants at the event.
 We have members of staff and volunteers from the PhD and MSc cohorts at the RBGE to talk through each step, as well as providing information about the work of the herbarium and Science Division in general. This is a great opportunity for us to engage with the public about our work, especially as the herbarium team has limited regular engagement with the wider public.
 Alongside the event we have a display about the Herbarium, including teaching specimens. The display provides information about the collections, without needing a team member to explain it, although we aim to have a member of staff available. Often, we find it is the parents/guardians of the children who are most interested in this, so it allows us to extend the group of people with whom we are engaging.
 Over the three years we have run the event, we have engaged with over 1,000 'collectors', ranging in age from 3-95 (Fig. 2), comprised of people from Edinburgh and visitors to the garden from farther afield. This figure does not include those additional members of the public who attend the event, as e.g. the parent/guardian of a child, but do not engage in creating a specimen themselves. If we include an estimate of these additional members of the public, the number of people engaged is nearer to 2,000–3,000.
 Feedback, both during the event and post-event, has been exceptional. We have had comments on how engaging the event is, as well as requests to take pictures so that others can run a similar event themselves.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139077', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.139077?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139077, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Data were gathered from 79 non-teaching personnel using a researcher-modified questionnaire covering demographic profiles, adherence to RA 6713, and performance ratings. Statistical analyses including descriptive statistics, Mann Whitney U-Test, Kruskal Wallis H-Test, and Spearman’s rho were employed to address research questions. The study indicated that non-teaching personnel at ISAT-U Miagao Campus demonstrated a very great extent of adherence to RA 6713, particularly among female staff and across all departments. Permanent employees generally exhibited slightly greater adherence to RA 6713. Performance ratings indicated outstanding performance across sex, departments, employment status, manner of employment, and years in government service. Significant differences were found in adherence based on employment status, but not based on manner of employment or years in government service. There was a positive correlation between adherence to RA 6713 and personnel’s performance. The study concluded that ISAT-U Miagao Campus non-teaching personnel exhibited strong adherence to RA 6713, with females showing higher adherence.

This study aims to conduct a gender analysis of postgraduate STEM education in Kazakhstan and identify promising directions for increasing women's participation in this field. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study is grounded in the principles of liberal feminism, which are used to evaluate women's participation at the master's and doctoral levels using the Gender Parity Index. A comparative approach was employed, with the main research method being an economic-statistical analysis of data from the Bureau of National Statistics on the distribution of master's and doctoral students by field of study and specialty, disaggregated by gender, from the 2019/2020 academic year to the 2023/2024 academic year. The study found that postgraduate STEM education in Kazakhstan is characterized by gender inequality: favoring women in the fields of «Science» and «Mathematics», and favoring men in «Technology» and «Engineering». In the post-pandemic period, amidst accelerated digitalization, the number of master's students in these fields increased, while the number of doctoral students and the number of women entering and studying at the postgraduate level decreased. Recommendations were proposed to remove barriers for women in STEM, as well as to create conditions that account for gender needs and foster an inclusive and supportive environment that promotes increased participation, professional growth, and success for women in these areas.",Education.

includes developing their skills, competencies, problem-solving abilities, as well as acquiring knowledge 
about themselves and their surroundings. STEM education can be a reliable ally in this process. The STEM 
perspective integrates four areas: S-Science, T-Technology, E-Engineering, and M-Mathematics. It 
employs an interdisciplinary approach that uses these sciences as access points for fostering investigation, 
dialogue, and critical thinking in children, relying on a constructivist, integrated and applied learning-by
doing approach. Teaching activities based on the STEM concept encourage open research, investigation, 
identifying problems, and proposing solutions. A formative, ameliorative psychopedagogical experiment 
conducted during the 2023-2024 school year aimed to identify the impact of STEM-specific didactic 
strategies in the Sciences domain on preschoolers’ scientific investigation skills. The research sample 
included 21 middle group children from Mărceni Bicaz Kindergarten, part of Regina Maria Bicaz 
Secondary School, in Neamț County. Through experiment, monitoring and statistical-mathematical 
techniques, data were collected, presented, analysed, and compared using an observation grid during pre-

a97cd89bb2ec77d53a7f73ecf11ddb0c5dd25de9,Kidney Sparing Surgery versus Radical Nephroureterectomy in Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma: A Meta-analysis and Systematic Review,"Kidney-sparing surgery (KSS) has been increasingly performed in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) in recent years. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the long-term oncologic and renal function outcomes of KSS with those of radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for UTUC.A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science in January 2024. A meta-analysis was performed to analyze overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), intravesical recurrence-free survival (IVRFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and surgery-related estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) variations.A total of 32 studies with 21615 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Patients treated with KSS were less likely to have hydronephrosis, more often had low-grade tumors, and were more frequently at a low-stage compared to those undergoing RNU. There were no significant differences between the KSS and RNU groups in terms of 5-year OS, 5-year CSS, 5-year RFS, 5-year IVRFS, 5-year MFS, and hazard ratios (HRs) for OS and CSS based on univariate or multivariable Cox regression analysis. Similar results were found in subgroup analyses comparing segmental urethrectomy (SU) with RNU. In the comparison between the endoscopic management (EM) and RNU groups, EM was associated with worse overall survival outcomes (HR,1.40; 95%CI,1.08-1.82; P=0.01) based on multivariable Cox regression analysis, and the upper tract recurrence rate (OR,39.06; 95%CI, 14.55-104.85; P<0.00001) was significantly higher in the EM group. On the other hand, in patients treated with KSS, postoperative renal function as measured by eGFR increased by 0.4ml/min/1.73 m2, while it decreased by 11.4ml/min/1.73 m2 in the RNU group (WMD, 11.81 ml/min/1.73 m2; 95%CI,9.06-14.56; P<0.0001).Our meta-analysis supports similar oncological outcomes between KSS and RNU, although tumor characteristics were not equally balanced. KSS can be considered the best choice option for patients with low-risk UTUC, as it offers better preservation of renal function. In terms of kidney-sparing options, SU could be a better alternative for the treatment of ureteral tumors compared to ureteroscopy, due to the higher local recurrence rate associated with EM.https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2024-5-0051/, identifier (INPLASY202450051).",Frontiers in Oncology,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://inplasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/INPLASY-Protocol-6251.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.37766/inplasy2024.5.0051?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.37766/inplasy2024.5.0051, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It attempted to identify the pre-and post-performance scores of the students and its significant difference as to their scientific investigation skills in science in terms of initiating and planning, performing and recording, analyzing and interpreting, and communication skills. Furthermore, it aims to determine the significant differences between the post-assessment performances of the two groups of students exposed to exploratory and explanatory case-based learning. The study utilized descriptive-experimental research. Two groups of Grade 9 students served as the respondents of the study which were selected through purposive sampling based on the total enrollment of grade 9 students enrolled for the school year 2023-2024 handled by the researcher. The result indicated that there is a significant difference between the pre-and post-performance scores of the two groups of students exposed to exploratory and explanatory case-based learning. Since there is a significant difference between the pre-and post-performance scores of the two groups of students, the null hypothesis is not supported. Likewise, there is a significant difference between the post-and post-performance scores except for their initiating and planning skills, the null hypothesis is partially not supported.

fee48aeb5a4bf34b6865684af4bd56012e1f5a72,Trust edges up-slightly.,"The Pew Research Center survey on trust in science and researchers is eagerly awaited every year by science policy experts and communicators. This year's results, released last week, give a small, but meaningful, reason to be optimistic: Trust in scientists, which took a substantial hit during the pandemic, is starting to recover. The survey, conducted in October 2024 with 9593 adults across the United States, estimates that 76% of Americans now have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in scientists to act in the public's best interests. That's a modest uptick from 73% last year and a hopeful sign that the page may be turning on some of the pandemic-era skepticism. Although the increase is barely outside the margin of error, it may mark the end of a troubling 3-year decline. However, the data reveal a persistent problem-a considerable portion of the public continues to harbor negative views of scientists' personal qualities, particularly their communication skills. This reality should be worrisome to the scientific community and drive a collective conversation about rebuilding public confidence.",Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1126/science.adu7081?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu7081, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d22c7a1d7b4a39049d5ae94d1f4656177a4a7b38,Perception of Early Clinical Exposure (ECE) among Phase I MBBS Students in a Medical College in Northeastern India,"Background: Early Clinical exposure (ECE) is a Learning methodology in Medical Education, which encourages exposure of the medical students to the clinical patients as early as the first year of medical college (Phase I MBBS). It helps them in applying basic science concepts to clinical patient care. Objective: To assess and analyze the Perception of Early Clinical Exposure (ECE) among Phase I MBBS students. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted January 2024 to March 2024 of 100 Phase I MBBS students who were first exposed to four Modules of ECE in both hospital and classroom settings. The outcomes and effectiveness of the students were then assessed and analyzed by a pre-structured, self-administered electronic questionnaire which contained both open-ended and close-ended items. Evaluation was done by statistical analysis of qualitative data and quantitative analysis of student comments using thematic analysis. Results: 97.6% of the students felt that Early Clinical Exposure is important in Phase I (1st year) while 2.4% of the participants were neutral on the question. 92.8% of students felt that ECE helped them in correlating physiology concepts with clinical cases while 86.9% of students felt that ECE helped in the retention of the topic. Majority of the students reported that ECE helped them in understanding and knowledge of the topic and provides them an exposure to reality of patient care and medical environment. Students also expressed the need for increasing the frequency and duration of ECE sessions. Conclusion: Our study reveals that Phase I MBBS students regard Early Clinical Exposure (ECE) as a pivotal methodology for enhancing their comprehension of fundamental scientific principles and their ability to correlate these principles with clinical applications.

Conclusion: In summary, a longer duration of OC usage may be related with a higher risk of OAG; however, it is unclear if OC use in general raises the risk of OAG or whether this potential association is mediated by IOP. An earlier age at natural menopause may increase the incidence of OAG. Most significantly, PMH use may be related with a lower IOP, and the estrogen-only kind of PMH may be associated with a lower risk of OAG.",Journal of advanced research in Medical and Health science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://nnpub.org/index.php/MHS/article/download/2039/1472', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.61841/8227z085?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.61841/8227z085, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aims to conduct a gender analysis of postgraduate STEM education in Kazakhstan and identify promising directions for increasing women's participation in this field. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study is grounded in the principles of liberal feminism, which are used to evaluate women's participation at the master's and doctoral levels using the Gender Parity Index. A comparative approach was employed, with the main research method being an economic-statistical analysis of data from the Bureau of National Statistics on the distribution of master's and doctoral students by field of study and specialty, disaggregated by gender, from the 2019/2020 academic year to the 2023/2024 academic year. The study found that postgraduate STEM education in Kazakhstan is characterized by gender inequality: favoring women in the fields of «Science» and «Mathematics», and favoring men in «Technology» and «Engineering». In the post-pandemic period, amidst accelerated digitalization, the number of master's students in these fields increased, while the number of doctoral students and the number of women entering and studying at the postgraduate level decreased. Recommendations were proposed to remove barriers for women in STEM, as well as to create conditions that account for gender needs and foster an inclusive and supportive environment that promotes increased participation, professional growth, and success for women in these areas.",Education.

This year's results, released last week, give a small, but meaningful, reason to be optimistic: Trust in scientists, which took a substantial hit during the pandemic, is starting to recover. The survey, conducted in October 2024 with 9593 adults across the United States, estimates that 76% of Americans now have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in scientists to act in the public's best interests. That's a modest uptick from 73% last year and a hopeful sign that the page may be turning on some of the pandemic-era skepticism. Although the increase is barely outside the margin of error, it may mark the end of a troubling 3-year decline. However, the data reveal a persistent problem-a considerable portion of the public continues to harbor negative views of scientists' personal qualities, particularly their communication skills. This reality should be worrisome to the scientific community and drive a collective conversation about rebuilding public confidence.",Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1126/science.adu7081?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu7081, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In fact, the results of social studies learning of class IX students of SMP Negeri 14 Malang in the 2023-2024 academic year still need to be optimized. This is evidenced by several conditions, including: (1) student learning outcomes that are still in the average range. (2) the role of student participation in social studies learning is low, and (3) the learning models applied by teachers do not vary. Based on these problems, a study was conducted entitled increasing student participation using the window-shopping learning model and explosion box media. This study used 143 respondents who were randomly determined to represent a population of 192 class IX students in the 2023/2024 academic year. The source of research data was obtained from secondary data in the form of social studies subject report card scores, and data collected using a questionnaire that showed the active role of students, as well as the application of the window-shopping learning model assisted by explosion box media. The data analysis technique used path analysis with the help of SPSS 21. The conclusion of this study: (1) the active role of students has a direct influence on learning outcomes, (2) the application of the window-shopping model assisted by explosion box media has a direct influence on learning outcomes, and (3) the application of the window-shopping learning model assisted by explosion box media can significantly mediate the influence of the active role of students on social studies learning outcomes.

03e82bfb1474272082b39a528307946de65e4b6a,Impact of a self-defense and self-assertion course on self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women,"Introduction & Purpose
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines violence as “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation” (World Health Organization, 2002, p. 5). There are different types of violence: physical, somatic or bodily violence, psychological, psychic or emotional violence, sexual violence, and violence involving deprivation or neglect (World Health Organization, 2002).
The number of violent crimes across Austria rose by 16.9% in 2022 compared to the previous year, to 78,836 reports (Bundesministerium für Inneres, 2023). According to Statista (2024), Austria ranked sixth out of a total of 27 European countries in terms of the relative number of people affected by rape in 2021, with women affected 9.2 times more frequently than men (37.8 vs. 4.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively). Austria ranked the same across Europe (out of 28 countries) with regard to the rate of female victims of intentional homicide, with a total of 0.98 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants (Europäisches Institut für Gleichstellungsfragen, 2022).
Robust psychological differences between women and men, so-called gender gaps, have been shown in literature. One gender gap, which has been systematically researched since the 1990s and which can still be found across cultures, is the lower self-esteem and self-confidence of girls and women compared to boys and men (Casale, 2020). This gender gap can in turn lead to inequalities in social status and salary (Righetti et al., 2020).
Psychological characteristics again appear to play an important role in violence. Indeed, Fazzone et al. (2000) identified personal protective factors, which include characteristics such as self-confidence, self-reliance, self-motivation, flexibility, and self-assurance, against community and interpersonal violence in home health care.
Scientific studies have shown the effectiveness of self-defense courses on psychological characteristics such as self-confidence and assertiveness of participants (Brecklin, 2008; Gidycz & Dardis, 2014). In particular, most of the self-defense training programs that were analyzed showed positive changes in the measured psychological characteristics, although these results were not always consistent (Brecklin, 2008). In addition, supposed important characteristics such as self-confidence and self-assurance were not measured in the majority of cases (Brecklin, 2008). It is also worth mentioning that these older studies are mostly unpublished dissertations and, in accordance with Brecklin (2008), measures used should be revised to better fit the specific situational goals of self-defense training. This means that rather than just measuring assertiveness in everyday situations, it would be interesting to measure the likelihood of participants using assertiveness techniques in potential assault situations (Brecklin, 2008).
The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate possible effects of a self-defense and self-assertion course (SSC) on self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women when being put into potential assault situations.
Methods
A quasi-experimental study was conducted with voluntary adult female participants in a two-day SSC lasting a total of 10 hours, along with adult female controls who also took part in the study. Inclusion criteria were female gender, age ≥ 18 years, fluency in German (reading and writing), and written informed consent. Participants who had taken part in a SSC or had been practicing martial arts/ combat sports within the 3 months before or during the surveyed period were excluded from the study. The participants were asked about the effects of the SSC as well as the control period using a standardized online questionnaire that complies with the ethical standards of the Department of Sports Science at the University of Innsbruck (certificate of good standing, 25/2006). The survey was conducted at two different times: directly before the start and directly after the end of the SSC (or before and after the simultaneous control period). The questionnaire in German language, which was developed based on relevant literature (Brecklin, 2008; Kidder et al., 1983), included both quantitative and qualitative variables such as open questions. Among other things, the participants were asked to imagine themselves in situations in which they were exposed to different forms as well as intensities of violence and to indicate their level of self-confidence and self-assurance in these situations. A visual analogue scale ranging continuously from 0 (does not apply at all) to 100 (applies completely) was used for this purpose. The SSC took place in the city of Innsbruck (Austria) at various educational institutions between May 2019 and February 2020. The program of the SSC was standardized and included physical defense techniques such as punching, pushing, and kicking techniques (~15%), protective postures, and liberation techniques (~50%), as well as theoretical inputs, exercises for setting boundaries, case studies, and role plays (~35%). Participants of the control group were free in choosing their activities during the control period, however, the participation neither in a SSC nor in martial arts/ combat sports was allowed.
Data are presented as means ± standard deviations. After checking for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test) and for homogeneity (Levene-Test), t-tests for independent samples were applied to check for differences between means of the change score of the assessed parameters of the two samples. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 29 women took part in the study: 18 in the intervention group (IG, 40.0 ± 12.4 years) and 11 in the control group (CG, 30.5 ± 9.9 years). The age difference between the groups was not significant. The results indicate that women in the IG showed significant changes in several parameters compared to those in the CG, particularly when being put into situations in which they were exposed to different forms and intensities of violence. Accordingly, higher self-confidence and self-assurance were evident in the case of severe physical violence as well as in the case of mild psychological violence and higher self-assurance was shown in the case of severe psychological violence (Figure 1). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to mild physical violence or mild and severe sexual violence. Furthermore, the assessment of the open questions with regard to the organization of the SSC and the program offered suggests that the courses were very well received by the participants.
Discussion
The study shows that a relatively short SSC leads to a higher increase of both self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women, both in situations of physical and psychological violence, compared to the control group. No significant differences between the groups were found with regard to situations of sexual violence, which is presumably due to the framework conditions of the courses (with only female participants). Therefore, future studies evaluating the impact of SSC on self-confidence and self-assurance of women exposed to sexual violence should include practice with male training partners. Additionally, in the interest of sustainability, it is important to achieve long-term changes in attitudes and behavior, which should be the goal of future research.
The study’s limitations that should be considered include the lack of an a priori power analysis, the absence of random group allocation, the missing standardization and supervision of the activity of the control group, the use of non-validated single-item scales, possible bias due to the overestimation of effects because of the temporal proximity of the survey to the SSC, and the failure to account for confounding variables such as age, which however did not differ significantly between groups.
Conclusion
Since violence is often perpetrated against women, particularly in Austria, and since women show less self-confidence and self-assurance than men, the promotion of high-quality SSC lasting at least 10 hours can be recommended to women in order to strengthen these resources.

Swanson, who was born 100 years ago. The works of Swanson are almost unknown in philosophy, yet his name is well recognized in the field of artificial intelligence, where it became foundational for a new sub-field of automatic generation of scientific hypotheses. The aim of this article is to introduce readers to the original concept of undiscovered knowledge proposed by D.R. Swanson. The second aim will be to investigate its relationship with other types: tacit, or implicit and open knowledge. The author develops ideas of Popper by proposing that not only physical world, but also the world of objective knowledge can be a source of new, non-trivial knowledge. Therefore, the search for novel scientific hypotheses has to start in the library rather than in the lab. This search can be made automatic given advances in the technologies of artificial intelligence.
The paper overviews historical development and current capabilities of AI to discover hidden knowledge in scientific literature. However, as will be shown in this article, advances in technologies of open access to knowledge is critical for the progress of science as well. This conclusion follows from the fact that undiscovered knowledge is in many respects the problem of access.",Philosophy of Science and Technology,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.21146/2413-9084-2024-29-2-34-46', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21146/2413-9084-2024-29-2-34-46?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21146/2413-9084-2024-29-2-34-46, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5b52f10160408f1bb076020e6188c102701bb06e,Pig organs in humans: a forum on xenotransplantation,"ABSTRACT What if one of your organs, say, the kidney, the heart or the liver, deteriorates completely, and you are not lucky enough to have a human organ for transplantation? Do you want to receive an organ from a pig? That is not a joke, but a subject some physicians and researchers are working on—a field of research known as ‘xenotransplantation’.In 2022, David Bennett, a 57-year-old patient with terminal heart disease, received a pig heart and survived for 2 months after the surgery. Another recipient, Lawrence Faucette, survived for 40 days after similar surgery in 2023. Then, in 2024, Rick Slayman, the world's first recipient of a pig kidney, passed away 2 months after the surgery. Rick was able to get out of the hospital during these 2 months and the transplant team said there is no indication that his sudden passing was the result of failure of the pig kidney graft. Rather, it was related to his heart disease. In China, a liver xenotransplantation from pig to a brain-dead patient was reported in 2024 and the transplanted liver survived in the human body for as long as 10 days.On April 2024, National Science Review organized a panel discussion on xenotransplantation, which was chaired by Prof. Liangxue Lai and involved six other experts in the field. The panelists had in-depth discussions on xenotransplantation, covering its history and the (i) gene editing of the donor pigs, (ii) immunosuppressive regimens required by the recipients, (iii) challenges in preclinical and clinical research, (iv) relevant ethical issues and (v) prospects for the future of xenotransplantation.

The current analysis defined precocious citation impact as rising to become a top-cited scientist within t≤8 years after the first publication year. Ultra-precocious citation impact was defined similarly for t ≤5 years. Top-cited authors included those in the top-2% of a previously validated composite citation indicator across 174 subfields of science or in the top-100,000 authors of that composite citation indicator across all science based on Scopus. Annual data between 2017 and 2023 show a strong increase over time, with 469 precocious and 66 ultra-precocious citation impact Scopus author IDs in 2023. In-depth assessment of validated ultra-precocious scientists in 2023, showed significantly higher frequency of less developed country affiliation (71%), clustering in 4 high-risk subfields (Environmental Sciences, Energy, Artificial Intelligence & Image Processing, Mechanical Engineering & Transports) (64%), self-citations for their field above the 95th percentile (31%), being top-cited only when self-citations were included (20%), citations to citing papers ratio for their field above the 95th percentile (15%), extreme publishing behavior (7%), and extreme citation orchestration metric c/h2<2.45 (15%) compared with all top-cited authors (p<0.005 for all signals). The 17 ultra-precocious citation impact authors in the 2017-2020 top-cited lists who had retractions by October 2024 showed on average 4 of these 7 signal indicators at the time they entered the top-cited list.

Significance statement Extreme performance may herald either extreme excellence or extreme inappropriate and outright fraudulent practices. Some authors reach the very top ranks in cumulative citation impact within only a few years, while even accomplished scientists take decades to reach these levels, if ever. A science-wide analysis of the authors with the most impressively precocious citation performance reveals that most of them come from less developed countries with limited resources, they heavily cluster in some scientific subfields, and they often have multiple signal indicators that may suggest problematic behavior.

f68a5e6ac7830ffe16f8d6c5e0491bde3e8c1ca6,Selecting an optimal sorghum cultivar can improve nitrogen availability and wheat yield in crop rotation,"Abstract BACKGROUND Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is a cereal crop known for its biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) capacity, a plant‐mediated activity limiting nitrification pathway. The use of BNI‐producing plants represents an environmentally friendly and cost‐effective approach to reduce nitrogen (N) losses, such as nitrate (NO3 −) leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) gas emissions. The present study aimed to test the effectiveness of different S. bicolor cultivars in rotation to retain ammonium (NH4 +) in soils and promote N availability for the subsequent wheat crop. A two‐year field rotation was established with four sorghum cultivars followed by winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Urea alone or combined with the urease inhibitor N‐(n‐butyl) thiophosphoric triamide was applied to promote a NH4 +‐based fertilization regimes. RESULTS AddingN‐(n‐butyl) thiophosphoric triamide maintained higher soil NH4 + content and reduced ammonia‐oxidizing bacteria population during sorghum cultivation. However, the benefits of the inhibitor on sorghum growth were cultivar‐dependent. Notably, the further reduction in ammonia‐oxidizing bacteria abundance for sorghum Voyenn and the increased soil NH4 + content for Vilomene suggested a BNI potential for these cultivars. Importantly, the Vilomene precedent enhanced wheat yield for both fertilization regimes. CONCLUSION Overall, the present study confirms that sorghum is a suitable catch crop and emphasizes the importance of selecting the proper sorghum cultivar to maximize the yield of the target wheat crop, at the same time as minimizing N losses. Furthermore, developing combined strategies with selected sorghum cultivars and the application of urease inhibitors enables to enhance sorghum productivity as forage, achieving added value to the rotation. © 2024 The Author(s).

4fddb798d9653f55d99a041f99f7501192c1cf44,Impacts of rainfall and rainfall anomalies on the population dynamics of rodents in southeast Asian rice fields.,"BACKGROUND
The mechanisms that regulate multi-annual population dynamics of rodent pest species of cereal crops is often unknown. Better knowledge of such aspects can aid pest management and in turn improve food security and human health. The patterns and processes of the population dynamics of Rattus argentiventer, in rice fields of Indonesia, and Rattus tanezumi, in rice fields of the Philippines were assessed in this article.


RESULTS
The meta-analysis of trapping data over 20 years in Indonesia, and 16 years in the Philippines indicated that rodent populations in rice fields did not show a regular multi-annual pattern. Rattus argentiventer populations in Indonesia responded to less rainfall from the current year. Rattus tanezumi populations in the Philippines responded positively to both rainfall and rainfall anomaly with a 1-year time lag.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study of long-term population data indicates that certain combinations of rainfall parameters could be useful to predict years when there is higher rodent abundance in rice fields. The key rodent pest species in rice fields in Indonesia (R. argentiventer) and the Philippines (R. tanezumi) differ, and the populations of each species respond differently to rainfall anomalies. Other factors such as crop cover and water availability may also be important and should be considered in future work. © 2024 The Author(s).

5e9cdd58ee0a54f236d1b7aaacd4ed394a9472f9,Enhancement of Biocrude Quality Using Fecal Sludge and Organic Solid Waste Through Two-Stage Hydrothermal Liquefaction Technique,"The escalating global challenge of managing unmanaged fecal sludge (250-300 million tonnes/year) and organic solid waste (600-700 million tonnes/year) necessitates innovative and sustainable waste-to-energy solutions. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of FS & OSW to produce biocrude has been seen as a double-edged sword to substitute fossil fuel and address the issues relating to unmanaged waste (GHG emission, global warming, climate change). Through this study, an approach was taken to improve the biocrude production and enhance the biocrude quality by introducing a two-stage heating in HTL of FS and OSW separately. Four different runs were comprised in this study where one run was in conventional one stage, at 320℃ for 60 min. In terms of the other three runs, in the first stage, 100, 200, and 300℃ were retained for 30 min respectively and the second stage was conducted at 320℃ for 30 min. Results indicate a substantial improvement in biocrude yield of 15% &18% through two-stage heating during HTL (30 min at 200℃, and then 30 min at 320℃) compared to conventional single-stage HTL processes of FS & OSW respectively with a biomass conversion rate of 70%. From the analysis of biocrude maturity & intensity of oil we observe a high potential for crude oil formation being classified as Kerogen type I. GC-FID shows that increasing heat in the first stage tends to produce a lighter fraction (at 300℃ in the first stage produces biocrude with a lighter fraction>80% from FS & OSW feedstocks) in biocrude. In addition to improving the overall efficiency of converting organic waste to biocrude, the two-stage system offers a more flexible platform that allows the biofuel composition to be customized to match the needs of individual applications. The results show that a two-stage HTL process is a feasible and effective technique for converting difficult waste streams into biofuels, with implications for both environmental sustainability and energy security.

d01ac4f765f596b32251f56412c257a4b8534e7b,A comprehensive survey on the present scenario and future production potentials of small-scale turkey farming in Bangladesh,"Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is one of the potential species of specialized fowls, quite popular in western countries, has recently been introduced in Bangladesh, and gained considerable attention from small-scale poultry farmers. The purpose of this study was to assess the current scenario, production systems and potentialities of turkey farming in Bangladesh. Data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire from 100 turkey farmers residing in rural areas in different districts of Bangladesh. The problems and prospects of turkey rearing in the selected areas were quantified and assessed. No illiterate farmers were involved in turkey farming and 97% of the farmers have small household with 3.67 members per family. Most of the farmers (60%) were medium income size with income range BDT 250001 to 400000 year. Most of the farmers (57%) reared turkey for meat purpose whereas the average turkey population per household was 43.20 birds. About 24% of farmers reared turkey in confinement system, and 76% of farmers reared in semi-intensive management system and 68% of farmers had no related training on turkey farming. All farmers use ready broiler/layer feed due to the unavailability of turkey feed that was bought from local market. Grazing was practiced to supply vegetative plants as diet for turkeys. Most of the farmers (86%) vaccinate turkey regularly, and among them 96% complained about vaccine unavailability. Average mortality was recorded at around 6.2%. All the farmers follow a natural breeding system for reproduction. The farmers mentioned that turkey farming is decreasing day by day due to unskilled farmers, lack of turkey ready feed, unavailability of vaccines and lack of marketing facilities. Collectively, it can be inferred that the introduction of ready-made turkey feed, ensuring vaccination, providing financial and technical assistance and offering training to small-scale turkey farmers are the pivotal factors in boosting small-scale turkey farming in Bangladesh. This, in turn, may have the potential to increase household income and generate employment opportunities for youth, rural women, and small-scale marginal farmers.

84657acfac0231bcf6faf7a516d3614c58df5bfe,﻿Vegetation Classification and Survey is performing well,"On the occasion of the completion of the fourth volume of Vegetation Classification and Survey (VCS), we have analysed the performance of the journal since its inception. The number of papers and pages show a moderate increase over the years. VCS has been included in the Scopus database for more than a year and received its first CiteScore of 2.0 in summer 2023 but is not yet included in the Web of Science Core Edition. We therefore used data from the Scopus database to compare the citation impact of articles in VCS with that of 29 other ecological journals. By calculating normalized citation rates per journal and publication year, we found that VCS started at the bottom of the rankings in the first two years (28th out of 30) but improved to 26th in 2022 and 14th in 2023. Together with the known time lag and the strong positive relationships between the different citation metrics, this allows a projection of the future development of the CiteScores and, after inclusion in the Web of Science, the Journal Impact Factor (JIF). Using the Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) from the Scopus database, we identified the top 12 out of 95 VCS articles published in the first four years that received more citations than expected for their age and field. We also present the four Editors’ Choice papers of 2023, among which Strohbach and Strohbach (2023; Vegetation Classification and Survey 4: 241–284) received the Editors’ Award in 2023. We conclude that VCS is on the right track, supported by the fact that in 2024 most authors will still be charged no or very low article processing charges (APCs).

f8fd0af0a98207cde301da46828eb002251b24b1,Impact of model physiotherapy centres in reducing the burden among the caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders in the rural area of Tamil Nadu: a study protocol,"Background Approximately 1 in 8 children under the age of 6 in Tamil Nadu are diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), yet only a fraction of these children receives proper medical care. The unequal distribution of healthcare services is mainly due to the lack of accessibility, especially in rural areas, leading to a significant burden on caregivers. This research aims to alleviate caregiver burden and reduce disability in preschool children by establishing model clinics or specialized outreach centers in rural villages, supported by SRM Institute of Science and Technology under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan Scheme.(UBA-SRMIST). Methods The study will commence with screening all preschool children registered in Anganwadi in the designated villages. Tailored model clinics will be set up in these villages based on the prevalence of NDD. Once established, children diagnosed with NDD will undergo rehabilitation for a year. Baseline and endline assessments will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the model center on both the child's disability and the caregiver burden. Discussion This research will demonstrate the effectiveness of a model outreach center in rural villages in reducing disability levels in children and alleviating caregiver burden by eliminating the need for long travels to access rehabilitation services. The findings of this study will not only contribute to the objectives of UBA-SRMIST in uplifting villages but also facilitate the creation of registries and provision of data to the government for the implementation of policies that address the current disparities in healthcare access.

b7dfc10f670d7b20c4f0596d9b76c9cb24f9b111,Effect of Rurality in Head and Neck Cancer: A Scoping Review.,"OBJECTIVES
This scoping review sought to evaluate the current literature regarding the following outcomes in relation to rurality: stage at diagnosis, clinical characteristics, treatment characteristics, and survival outcomes of head and neck cancer (HNC).


DATA SOURCES
A literature search was performed using PubMed (MEDLINE), Science Direct, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases.


REVIEW METHODS
A 20-year study cutoff from the initial search was used to increase the comparability of the studies regarding population and standards of clinical care. These searches were designed to capture all primary studies reporting HNC incidence, presenting characteristics, treatments, and treatment outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts, selected articles for exclusion, extracted data, and appraised studies. Critical appraisal was done according to the Joanna Briggs Institute Quality Assessment Tool for Cohort Studies.


FINDINGS
Twenty eligible original articles were included. Stage at diagnosis, clinical characteristics, treatment characteristics, and survival outcomes were measured. Our review indicates that although this relationship is unclear, there may be variations in treatment choice for laryngeal cancer based on geographic location and rural residency status. The studies assessing HNC outcomes related to stage at diagnosis, clinical characteristics, treatment characteristics, and overall survival demonstrated conflicting findings, indicating a need for further research examining HNC outcomes with a focus on rurality as the main exposure.


CONCLUSIONS
The relationship between HNC and rural-urban status remains unclear. More studies are needed, along with a consistent metric for measuring rurality and recruitment of comparable populations from both rural and urban areas.

e54ff9c981f9743cb8ed2044e73ce1cdb86affae,Keeping the Promise - Annual Report 2023,"Last year was one of broken records and broken promises. We saw new highs of greenhouse gas emissions, temperature records tumbling and climate impacts arriving stronger and faster. The finance to help vulnerable communities adapt to climate change isn’t being delivered. At the same time, most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are off track at the halfway point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. There are many reasons for this, but it is clear that slow action on the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste is a major driving force. This is the downside. The upside is that the global response to the triple planetary crisis intensified. Efforts to combat pollution and waste received a shot in the arm with the agreement of the Global Framework on Chemicals and progress on the global instrument on plastic pollution, which should be ready by 2024. Nations adopted a treaty to protect biodiversity in the ocean beyond national borders, while key guidelines to help the private sector reduce its impact on nature were released – a boost to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, the implementation of which gathered pace. Finally, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP28, delivered a clear call on countries to transition away from fossil fuels – alongside a framework on the Global Goal on Adaptation, operationalizing the Loss and Damage Fund, and new commitments on sustainable cooling, methane reduction, tripling renewable energy targets and nature breakthroughs. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) played an important role in many of these processes – by providing key science and solutions on the triple planetary crisis, convening and supporting important negotiations, hosting critical multilateral environmental agreements, working with the private and financial sectors to align funding with global processes and supporting Member States to deliver on their commitments.",,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://wedocs.unep.org/xmlui/bitstream/20.500.11822/44777/20/UNEP_Annual_Report_2023_French.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.59117/20.500.11822/44777?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.59117/20.500.11822/44777, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The relevance of the research topic is emphasized by the update of the Federal State Educational Standard for general education and the tasks outlined by the President of Russia in his annual message to the Federal Assembly. An important role in the implementation of these provisions is played by the teacher, whose professional development, his practice-oriented activities during the period of a year-long internship at school based on the development of functional literacy contributes to the high-quality training of a specialist. When restructuring the educational process from a face-to-face to an online format based on the use of the capabilities of the most common Internet services and information and digital technologies, the authors introduced a set of tasks for a year-long practical training and course design. The successful testing of the methodology proposed by the authors was the project of the winning student of the “Pedagogical Debut 2024” competition, based on the practice-oriented aspect of the formation of functional literacy of school students through interdisciplinary synthesis, the use of elements of design and research activity in the study of bony fish (morphological, anatomical, biological features of the ichtheofauna Volga). The most effective seems to be the use of both traditional and new forms and means of teaching biology (electronic didactic material, media resources, virtual excursions, computer workshops).","Izvestiya of the Samara Science Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

8ace55f48c1ae9f2ab577fde0ae695a2930f4e93,Comparison of different attract-and-kill device densities to control the adult population of Popillia japonica (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae).,"BACKGROUND
Popillia japonica Newman is a scarab beetle native to Japan that is considered a serious pest outside its native range. It can feed on more than 400 host plants and spread about 10 km per year in invaded territories, therefore it is considered the second most important quarantine pest in Europe. Both chemical and biological insecticides have been used for control, with variable results. Despite ongoing efforts, P. japonica remains a threat in invaded countries, and it is necessary to test more effective and sustainable solutions in the context of integrated pest management. Here we present a study on long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) assembled in semiochemical-baited attract-and-kill devices (A&Ks) as a means to control adults of P. japonica with low environmental impact. This study complements previous ones in which we first evaluated the effectiveness of the LLINs in the laboratory and then tested both effectiveness and duration in field-exposed A&Ks against P. japonica. In the present work we compared the effectiveness of three different densities of A&Ks per hectare in areas where the population of P. japonica was numerically homogeneous.


RESULTS
The different densities of A&K (1, 2, 4 A&Ks per ha) resulted in an overall reduction of the population of P. japonica by about two thirds in comparison to the control area.


CONCLUSIONS
This study suggests that the use of one A&K per hectare, requiring minimal management effort, is an effective ratio for reducing local populations of P. japonica. © 2024 The Author(s).

0727c41471bbf38f3d17ed3a6bec2653be0b7c6f,An assessment of seasonal bait uptake by individual grey squirrels to develop a delivery system for oral contraceptives.,"Globally, human-wildlife conflicts continue to increase, owing to human population growth and expansion. Many of these conflicts concern the impacts of invasive non-native species. In the UK, the invasive, non-native grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis negatively affects tree health and has caused the decline of the native red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris. Oral contraceptives are being developed to manage the impacts of the grey squirrel. To be effective, contraceptives will need to be deployed at a landscape scale, and will require a delivery system that is practical and economically viable. Understanding grey squirrel feeding behaviour is important so that delivery methods can be designed so that a sufficient number of target individuals receive an effective contraceptive dose at a time of year that will ensure their infertility throughout peak times of breeding. The main aims of this study were to assess how sex, season, squirrel density and bait point density influenced; (1) the probability of a squirrel visiting a feeder and (2) the amount of bait consumed from feeders. Field trials were conducted on six woodland populations of squirrels in three seasons, with four days of bait deployment via purpose-designed squirrel-specific bait hoppers with integrated PIT-tag readers. It was possible to deliver multiple doses on most days to most male and female grey squirrels, with bait deployment more likely to be effective in spring, immediately before the second annual peak in squirrel breeding, followed by winter, immediately before the first peak in breeding. The results from this study could be used to design methods for delivering oral contraceptive baits to grey squirrels in the future and the methods used could be applied to other small mammal species and other bait delivery systems. © 2024 Crown copyright and The Author(s).

Thus, the purpose of this study is to present a high-quality alternative to recover muscle tone and mobility, consisting of a hand-exoskeleton for passive rehabilitation. It covers a motion protocol for each finger and pressure sensors to give a safety pressure range during the gripping function. The bio-design method covers standards (ISO 13485 and VDI 2206) based on biomechanic and anthropometric fundamentals, where Fusion 360 was used for mechanical development and electrical-electronic circuit schematics. The prototyping process was based on 3D printing using polylactic acid (PLA); also, the actuators were servomotors DS3218, the pressure sensors were RP-C7.6-LT, and the microcontroller was Arduino Nano. The system has been validated by the Institute of Research in Biomedical Sciences (INICIB) at the Ricardo Palma University, where the novelty of this work lies in the introduction of a new mobile-prismatic joint mechanism. In conclusion, favorable results were achieved regarding the complete flexion and extension of the fingers (91.6% acceptance rate, tested in 100 subjects), so the next step proposes that the wearable device will be used in the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Departments of Medical Centers. Doi: 10.28991/ESJ-2024-08-06-02 Full Text: PDF",Emerging Science Journal,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ijournalse.org/index.php/ESJ/article/download/2444/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.28991/esj-2024-08-06-02?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.28991/esj-2024-08-06-02, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d82e9a1ac448e832ed70ea20365b7f1d733e5a90,"Maize yields have stagnated in sub-Sahara Africa: a possible transgenic solution to weed, pathogen and insect constraints.","Despite major breeding efforts by various national and international agencies, yields for the ~40 million hectares of maize, the major food crop in sub-Saharan Africa, have stagnated at <2 tons/ha/year for the past decade, one-third the global average. Breeders have succeeded in breeding increased yield with a modicum of tolerance to some single-weed or pathogen stresses. There has been minimal adoption of these varieties because introgressing polygenic yield and tolerance traits into locally adapted material is very challenging. Multiple traits to deal with pests (weeds, pathogens, and insects) are needed for farmer acceptance, because African fields typically encounter multiple pest constraints. Also, maize has no inherent resistance to some of these pest constraints, rendering them intractable to traditional breeding. The proposed solution is to simultaneously engineer multiple traits into one genetic locus. The dominantly inherited multi-pest resistance trait single locus can be bred simply into locally adapted, elite high-yielding material, and would be valuable for farmers, vastly increasing maize yields, and allowing for more than regional maize sufficiency. © 2024 The Author(s).

bf03a2867d1d1a00cfcb8cfb71818416540b7ca5,Strengthening Health Security through Sustainable Vaccine Economics and Equity,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted substantial inequities in access to vaccines. A primary reason behind this inequity was the concentration of manufacturing capacity in developed regions of the world. The lack of a distributed spread of local facilities has meant that many countries are reliant on global suppliers and manufacturers, making the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) vulnerable to pandemics.1 Addressing this imbalance in terms of accessibility to life-saving vaccines is crucial for health security and vaccine equity. 
Gavi’s new five-year strategy (Gavi 6.0’ for 2026–2030) aims to address these issues with a vision “leaving no one behind with immunisation”. GAVI mission was revised for Gavi 5.0 and puts ‘equity’ at the heart of the Alliance’s strategy to increase equitable and sustainable use of vaccines. GAVI 6.0 incorporates a new principle on the climate change while equity will remain at the core of Gavi’s next strategy, as a key contribution to the Immunisation Agenda 2030 (IA 2030) and the Sustainable Development Goals. At the heart of the Gavi model is also a unique approach to programmatic and financial sustainability.2 Grounded in Gavi’s eligibility, transition and co-financing (ELTRACO) policy, the model has been highly successful so far in bolstering country ownership of vaccine programmes and in driving domestic public resource allocation towards immunisation. From 2011 to 2023, countries increased their resources for Gavi-supported vaccines from US$ 36 million to US$ 630 million, representing 41% of the combined investment by Gavi and countries into routine, Gavi-supported vaccines. At the end of 2023, 19 countries had fully transitioned out of Gavi support. 
In line with Gavi’s vaccine policy, based on the country’s Gross National Income (GNI); Pakistan will eventually graduate from GAVI support which would result in added economic capitals to sustain the vaccine accessibility which are acquired as country co-financing share. Despite progress, immunisation coverage in Pakistan remains low, and the country has not met its 2015 health, nutrition, and population (HNP) Millennium Development Goals targets.4 Establishing a local vaccine manufacturing facility is imperative to reduce reliance on contract manufacturing and streamline the supply chain for the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) and health security. 
The BioNTech mRNA Vaccine Manufacturing Facility in Rwanda serves as a model for sustainable vaccine production in LMICs. With a $150 million investment and local personnel training, the facility aims to produce mRNA-based vaccines by 2025, promoting vaccine production and supply in African Union member states. Similar initiatives can be replicated regionally to enhance vaccine self-sufficiency.5 Currently, over 60% of BCG and over 80% of measles vaccines are produced in India and Indonesia, underscoring the need for Pakistan to develop its vaccine production capabilities. The domestic market’s annual vaccine intake is Rs 17.6 billion, indicating substantial demand and potential for local manufacturing.6 
Developing the capacity for essential immunisation in the country requires more than market-driven solutions. Achieving global vaccine equity demands transparency, active government oversight, favourable intellectual property policies, proactive technology transfers, and building regional technical, manufacturing, and regulatory capacities. Public-private partnerships (PPP) can expedite the establishment of Bioequivalence and Bioavailability centres, ensuring sustainable vaccine technology aligned with international standards (FDA, WHO, EU). By addressing these challenges, we can create a resilient and equitable global health security system, ensuring vaccine equity and sustainability in the fight against infectious diseases.

28fcad008483c60b8ae08f9530e6923488eccd42,Enhancing Taxonomic Skills in West Africa and Supporting the Growth of GC Herbarium (Ghana),"Training the next generation of environmental scientists is critical to the future of life on Earth as acknowledged in 2021 by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG, Kew) in Our Manifesto for Change. RBG, Kew is also committed to strengthening capacity in the most biodiverse tropical countries by sharing expertise and collections, to enhance the global conservation effort. Developing training programmes to enhance taxonomic capacity in Africa and meeting the demand for early career in-country taxonomists was identified as the first step to accelerate the documentation and conservation of African plant diversity.
 Two years ago, RBG, Kew, in collaboration with the University of Ghana and the Ghana Herbarium (GC) and with support from the Schroder Charity Trust and Mallinckrodt Foundation, developed a tailored “Plant Taxonomy Skills for Ecology and Conservation” training course. This was planned to run in Africa, South America and Asia, alternating each year. The pilot was organised in Ghana, Africa in 2022. Participants for this 5-week course were selected from over 260 applicants. Delivered in a hybrid format, the course started with 3 weeks of online lectures, pre-recorded by 15 plant scientists and curators at RBG, Kew, as well as online interactive sessions. This was then followed by 2 weeks of in-person training in Ghana, including a 1-day field trip for practical collecting tips. The training covered herbarium curation techniques as well as concepts and skills needed for taxonomic revisions such as nomenclature, taxonomy, analysis of herbarium specimens, databasing, geo-referencing, preparation of morphological descriptions, diagnosis and identification keys as well as building distribution maps and red listing. The in-country teaching team included a curator-botanist, a plant taxonomist, a science education coordinator from RBG, Kew and two professors from University of Ghana. The course ended with a written assignment in the form of a taxonomic revision. A short survey was sent out to all course participants two years after the course to gather impacts of the training on their careers and uncover the most positive and negative aspects of the course.
 The course provided many positive outcomes: 15 plant taxonomists from eight African countries were trained, and jointly produced a taxonomic revision of 28 species of Ipomoea L. (Convolvulaceae) from Ghana (Williams et al. 2024). Additionally, The African Taxonomists Network was initiated by the course participants with a mission of ‘Fostering the next generation of taxonomists to bridge the generational gap and revitalize the relevance of taxonomy in Africa for the future.’ This network now has over 60 members, meets regularly online, and has a large presence on social media. Furthermore, the course also resulted in the awarding of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) Biodiversity Challenge grant to the GC Herbarium in 2022. This grant enabled acquiring essential plant collecting equipment and herbarium materials, either by sourcing them in Ghana or from abroad. The GC herbarium, founded in 1952, contains ~85,000 collections of plant and algae specimens from Ghana and across West Africa with high historical, teaching and research value. This collection is vital to enhancing in-country taxonomic capacity. Therefore, the improvement and upgrade supported by the grant, as well as its recognition, are essential. Another rewarding impact of the course is strengthening of links between RBG, Kew and African institutions of higher education. These links have quickly developed into a larger partnership and were the first step towards a long-term collaboration. The ultimate objective of this collaboration has been to create the necessary conditions, both in infrastructure and human capacity to deliver the Flora of Ghana. This will be achieved by implementing a project to support the maintenance and growth of the GC herbarium in addition to taxonomic capacity building and teaching.
 The participants benefited from the course by engaging with mentors, networking and exchanging ideas, forming links with individuals with similar research interests and obtaining additional training and career progression opportunities. In the feedback survey, all participants reported that this course made them consider a career or future studies in plant taxonomy and 80% of the participants reported securing a new job or a student position in plant taxonomy two years after the course. In addition, all participants listed several positive impacts of the course on their career such as confidence in producing a taxonomic revision, gaining herbarium management skills and opportunities for new collaborations. This course has been subsequently successfully run in South America (Bolivia) and Asia (Indonesia), with expectations of similarly positive outcomes, and is already planned to return to Africa (Kenya) in 2025.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139237', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.139237?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139237, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b9760b88ec2ef4750e44e00893ea455d403ccd24,Long-term stability of extra virgin olive oil: effects of filtration and refrigeration storage on the Kolovi variety.,"BACKGROUND
The composition of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) defines its sensory, nutritional, and human health benefits, and distinguishes it as a key component of the Mediterranean diet. Nevertheless, EVOO constituents are susceptible to degradation during processing and storage, which reduces the olive oil's quality and limits its shelf life. The present study investigated the effect of molecular filtration before storage and the effect of cool storage at 4 °C on the stability of 'Kolovi' EVOO, a variety originating from the Greek island of Lesvos, over a 24 month period.


RESULTS
Storing EVOO at 4 °C positively affected free acidity, peroxide value, K268, fruity qualities, and concentrations of hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, ligstroside aglycone, lutein, and squalene, in comparison with the control sample stored at room temperature, particularly after 1 year. Molecular filtration significantly affected the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids (UFAs/SFAs). Optimal preservation of parameters such as acidity value and lutein content was achieved by combining molecular filtration with refrigeration.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study recommends storing EVOO in the refrigerator for up to 18 months. Based on the regulatory limits of the quality characteristics of acidity, peroxide value, K232 value and fruity sensory attributes, the shelf-life of the protected geographical indication (PGI) 'Kolovi' EVOO can reach 2 years under cool storage (4 °C) and with molecular filtration before storage. © 2024 The Author(s).

d6cd5dd4ef5b0301cb78202f6641800cd70901c2,The UWI Zoology Museum and Bioblitzing in Trinidad & Tobago: Mutual Benefits,"In 2012, as Zoology Curator for the University of the West Indies Zoology Museum (UWIZM), based at the St. Augustine campus in Trinidad and Tobago, I ran the first ever bioblitz to be held in Trinidad. Since then, an event has been conducted annually. Each event is organised mainly by staff and students in The University of the West Indies (UWI) Department of Life Sciences alongside members of the Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists' Club (TTFNC). A typical event would follow this basic format: choose a new location each year, find a basecamp, set up a search area (usually a 5 km radius circle), promote the event, organise survey teams, start surveying on a Saturday, invite the public along on a Sunday to get involved and then announce the results.
 Over the years, the bioblitzes have been attended and/or assisted by more than 30 groups and organisations. These included long-established bodies such as the Asa Wright Nature Centre, the Pointe-a-Pierre Wildfowl Trust, and the Zoological Society of Trinidad and Tobago; government bodies like the Institute of Marine Affairs, the Forestry Division and the Environmental Management Authority; and newer, smaller groups such as Trinibats, Turtle Village Trust, Environmental Research Institute Charlotteville (ERIC), the Reptile Conservation Center Of Trinidad and Tobago and The El Socorro Centre for Wildlife Conservation (ECWC) (Fig. 1).
 The way these groups contributed to the events varied from being basecamp hosts to providing animal encounter experiences, and from granting access to land and giving permits to providing expert wildlife surveyors. Organisations were usually approached by me with an invitation to join a bioblitz, depending on the needs and location of the event. Sponsors for the events were found by writing to local companies, approaching those who already had community funding programmes in place.
 I left the role of UWIZM curator in 2019, but the Trinidad and Tobago Bioblitz continued and evolved. In 2019, it followed the same pattern as previous events: the organisers partnered with a local school for a basecamp and the usual participants surveyed and welcomed the public. However, in 2020 with the first COVID lockdown, they had to adapt and so changed the bioblitz into an event facilitated online by using the iNaturalist platform: T&T Bioblitz 2020 Backyard Edition. At this stage, people were restricted to their gardens or streets so observation opportunities were limited, but nevertheless there were around 6,500 observations made of almost 1,400 species over one weekend in November.
 In 2021, restrictions were still in place for large gatherings but people could travel more widely, so the same online format was repeated. Observations could be made in some of the locations of previous events, which led to 2,900 observations and just over 1,000 species. For 2022, the event stayed online but became the Inter-Island Bioblitz as it went regional with participants from Jamaica and Barbados being invited. Almost 600 people took part and recorded over 1,300 species. Finally, in 2023, the bioblitz returned to the original format and an in-person event was again possible; this continued into 2024.
 The recording of results changed over the years. For example, the use of iNaturalist went from 9 observations in 2012 to over 6,500 observations in 2020. As I was no longer resident in Trinidad, I couldn't take part directly but though iNaturalist, I could contribute by identifying observations, as could many other international identifiers. 
 The majority of records made during the events were observations rather than the collection of specimens, but for some groups it was necessary to collect for further identification. Specimens collected were mostly terrestrial invertebrates, although sometimes roadkill and other specimens found dead during the events were also added to the UWIZM collections.
 After each bioblitz, a large banner was produced showing a summary of the results (Fig. 2). These were displayed at subsequent events and also as part of other displays in the UWIZM. Likewise, the trails and quizzes made for the bioblitzes were often used during the rest of the year for school groups visiting the UWIZM.
 Both in the lead up to a bioblitz and in the weeks following the event, the results are promoted in several ways: on social media (Facebook at first and later Instagram and Twitter), in national newspapers, on TV (usually getting a slot on a morning show), and through the TTFNC's Quarterly Bulletin, the final edition of the year being dedicated to that year's bioblitz. A T&T bioblitz website was made, which allowed us to collate all these outputs as well as access to the final reports for each event.
 Bioblitzes are fantastic events that bring together naturalist experts and the public. They should be a part of any natural history museum's repertoire, helping to promote and popularise the museum, as well as often providing a first exposure of citizen science to people, which can lead to a lifelong connection with nature (Fig. 3).",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.137368', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.137368?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.137368, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

39162965e7c0967f0a7822c7cdfbcb3981b14bbc,STATISTICAL METHODS FOR PREDICTING PHISHING ATTACKS,"The article proposes a methodology for predicting so-called phishing attacks, which are a common form of cybercrime, the number of which is growing every year, and the level of their harmful impact on the information systems of critical infrastructure objects is also increasing. To analyze trends and predict phishing attacks, we used statistical data published in scientific works of domestic and foreign researchers, as well as published by online publications of leading consulting companies working in the field of information security and cybersecurity. Statistical methods based on the use of time series, as one of the popular approaches used to predict various technological and economic processes, were chosen as tools for researching and predicting phishing attacks. This made it possible to analyze the types and patterns of phishing attacks that attackers use to disrupt the operation of software of information and communication systems and automated systems. Based on time series analysis, a trend model was built for the number of detected phishing attacks for the period 2020–2023. A calculation was made of the predicted number of phishing attacks for 16 quarters of 2020–2023, as well as the estimated forecast of the occurrence of these attacks for four quarters of 2024. To improve the forecast, a coefficient taking into account the seasonality factor was calculated and a correlation and regression analysis of the impact of phishing attacks on the total number of attacks detected during 2020–2023 was performed. Calculations have been performed, indicating that the discrepancies in the predicted values are not significant; the results presented allow us to select the optimal strategy for identifying, predicting and eliminating computer attacks related to phishing. Based on the time series model and the calculations obtained, it was concluded that statistical forecasting methods make it possible to build a forecast of phishing attacks, provide in the future the opportunity to develop and formulate methods for countering these attacks, and plan measures to increase the level of security of information resources.","Cybersecurity: Education, Science, Technique",2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://csecurity.kubg.edu.ua/index.php/journal/article/download/561/439', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.28925/2663-4023.2024.23.5670?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.28925/2663-4023.2024.23.5670, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

17039b79e25b80021a9017e81c77ee726677dd67,"Building New Opportunities: Planning Towards Integrated, Open and Accessible Natural History Collections","The accessibility, value and role of natural history collections (NHCs) for nature conservation, education and society in general, increases over time. The concept of NHCs evolves through advancements in information systems, research methods, and collection studies (Miller et al. 2020). Therefore, we need a new infrastructure for NHCs, which provides the necessary physical and organizational structures to support this evolving approach, including digitization labs, digital solutions for improved workflows, and architectural designs like publicly viewable collection workplaces. With this concept, the contemporary museum constitutes a shared space that recognises the importance of nature, supported by a science-based approach.
 The Estonian Museum of Natural History (EMNH) is currently making one of the largest developmental leaps in its 160-year history. In total, approximately 360,000 specimens, dating back 200 years, are preserved in the museum’s storage facilities. The museum’s collection contains specimens from around the world and is focused on Estonia’s natural heritage. The collection includes extensive mycological, zoological, botanical, geological, and science-related historical artifacts (e.g., collecting equipment, models of specimens), along with photo and multimedia collections. Currently, 95% of the museum's collections are digitized. The specimen data is published in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), with the original data housed on the PlutoF and Geocollections platforms.
 Although the museum plays a significant role in advancing the natural sciences, people outside the museum's circle might find it difficult to perceive how vast and unique the collections are, and what kind of work is done behind the scenes. The role of collections in science, education or society in general is also only vaguely acknowledged.
 By constructing a new building for the EMNH, scheduled to open in 2027, new opportunities arise. As a new community centre, the museum provides the opportunity for visitors, emerging professionals, citizen scientists, students, etc. to enhance and share their knowledge of the importance of biodiversity.
 Some examples of the numerical growth the new building will bring, compared to old museum facilities, are as follows: the museum could attract 200 000 more visitors than we are able to welcome in the current building. The new building will have ten times more exhibition space and the collection area will enlarge more than 50% from its current size.
 Many infrastructural and conceptual ideas applied in the new building will contribute to integrating our NHCs into society. Extra workspace will provide sufficient room for curators and students, researchers, and interns. New curator workrooms contain flexible spaces for different projects. The exhibition hall features display windows allowing visitors to peek into the curator’s workrooms, collection spaces, and the wet preparations lab. By embracing the principle of an open collection, the museum offers a unique opportunity to observe how specimens are stored and what procedures are involved in their preservation. This way the usually hidden part of the museum is integrated to the exhibition.
 A special room is planned for a mixed collection, comprised of a variety of differently prepared specimens and a display of various storage methods. The room will be primarily used to welcome groups and provide educational visits. For hands-on education, the new building will house a learning laboratory, classrooms and a space with direct access from the street for workshops, meetings, and experimental exhibitions, making it easier to engage passers-by. The exhibition area will have a multifunctional activity space within the exhibition, where museum staff can showcase various sections of their work.
 The digitization lab provides the opportunity to create high-quality photos and digital twins of specimens (Reinhardt et al. 2024), making them more accessible among scientists and the wider public. Improved digital imaging quality enhances research possibilities for photo analysis and AI applications. The new workshop also provides an excellent opportunity for conservation and taxidermy of specimens.
 We engaged target groups from school children to specialists during the planning process to make a museum that fulfills their needs. The new museum is planned as a platform that engages the society, initiates discussions, and brings together various target and interest groups to discuss environmental topics. By planning and building new infrastructure for the EMNH, we develop both digital and physical functionality and make our NHCs more accessible to all interest groups.
 The concept of open collections brings the behind-the-scenes activities to everyday visitors, engages people, and informs them about the opportunities and the role of NHCs. The new core exhibition and the science-based environmental-educational activities tightly linked to our NHCs will create a new incubator for positive changes. By developing and introducing new methods of making our NHCs accessible to a wider audience, the collections can better assist the society in making decisions and raising awareness.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.140408', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.140408?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.140408, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 Approximately 18,000 cases of Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are diagnosed worldwide per year making this cancer the most prevalent (30%) of the non-Hodgkin’s Lymphomas (NHL). Despite the success of R-CHOP treatment, approximately 40% of patients are refractory or relapse. While much progress has been made with CAR-Ts and bi-specific antibodies following frontline therapy in recent years, there remains a need for an orally bioavailable small-molecule that targets molecular drivers of NHL. The BCL6 transcription factor has long been known as an oncogenic driver of B-cell malignancy. The BCL6 gene has been found to be translocated and/or mutated resulting in deregulation of its expression, predominantly in DLBCL and Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL). The deregulated expression and scaffolding role of BCL6 in the transcriptional repressor complex make it an ideal target for the PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC®) technology with one BCL6 degrader recently entering Phase 1 trials. We undertook a medicinal chemistry campaign to identify a BCL6-targeting PROTAC®. This effort identified ARV-393, an orally bioavailable PROTAC® that recruits BCL6 and the E3 ligase cereblon to rapidly degrade BCL6 via the cell’s natural ubiquitin proteasome system. ARV-393 is potent, demonstrating DC50 and GI50 values <1 nM in numerous DLBCL and BL cell lines. This agent demonstrates deep BCL6 degradation in vitro and in vivo, resulting in excellent TGI in several tumor xenograft models supporting a first-in-human trial in 1H 2024. We will present the chemical structure of ARV-393 and selected pre-clinical data.

35c86c89f95e50fb3f0c54f2e8f8d5300f02c033,Survival Outcomes of Transoral Microsurgery in T3/T4a Laryngeal Tumors: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE
To critically evaluate oncological and functional outcomes following transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) in patients with T3/T4a glottic and supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).


DATA SOURCES
A comprehensive search of five major databases-PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science-was conducted using a combination of relevant keywords and MeSH terms.


REVIEW METHODS
Systematic review and meta-analysis of odds ratio (OR), hazards ratio (HR), and proportion, focusing on oncological and functional outcomes of TLM in advanced T3/T4a glottic and supraglottic tumors. A random-effects meta-analysis model was employed.


RESULTS
The review incorporated 29 cohort studies, representing a total of 1,897 patients undergoing TLM for T3/T4a glottic and supraglottic SCC. The cumulative 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate for T3 glottic and supraglottic tumors was 44.4% (95% CI: 47-66%) and 62.8% (95% CI: 63-81%), while the 5-year DFS for T4 glottic and supraglottic tumors was 41.1% (95% CI: 33.4-49.2%) and 32.9% (95% CI: 19.3-50.1%), respectively. T3 glottic tumors exhibited a 2.5-fold significantly higher odds of local recurrence post-TLM compared to their T3 supraglottic tumors (95% CI: 1.6-3.9, p < 0.0001). Laryngeal preservation rates for T3glottic and supraglottic tumors were 68.9% (95% CI: 48.7-83.8%) and 88.4% (95% CI: 79.4-93.8%), respectively. Both groups showed comparable rates of tracheostomy (p = 0.48) and gastrostomy performed (p = 0.17).


CONCLUSIONS
This meta-analysis suggests that TLM is a viable larynx preservation approach in select patients with T3/T4a glottic and supraglottic tumors. However, glottic tumors may have less favorable outcomes after TLM compared to those with advanced supraglottic tumors.

3482e532784043e42aa6b0fd1c4aab0e18ef77da,Clozapine for persons with neurodevelopmental disorders: a systematic review and expert recommendations for clinical practice.,"INTRODUCTION
We aimed to synthesize the information on the risks and benefits of clozapine prescription for resistant challenging behavior in persons with neurodevelopmental disorders.


METHODS
Articles were identified with MEDLINE, Web of Sciences and PsycINFO search from inception through January 2024. The review was restricted to persons with intellectual disability (ID) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) without comorbid psychotic or affective disorder. Data were synthesized narratively.


RESULTS
We identified 24 articles (13 case reports, eight chart studies, two controlled studies, one pharmaco-epidemiological study) including 296 patients with ID (n = 222) or ASD (n = 74) (10% aged ≤18 years). After clozapine initiation, a decreased frequency of challenging behavior persisting over time was reported in most participants included in clinical studies, and a significant reduction in the number of admissions in the population-based two-year mirror-image study. Adverse drug reactions were those commonly observed with clozapine, i.e. constipation, sedation, weight gain.


CONCLUSIONS
Since only four participants were included in the controlled studies, the benefits of clozapine in neurodevelopmental disorders are supported by a body of evidence exclusively drawn from observational studies. Further studies are required to clarify the indications of clozapine with respect to the unmet need induced by resistant challenging behavior.

This systematic review assessed whether bond strength is affected by the type of aging conditions, bonding agents, flowable resin composites, impression materials, temporary materials, and/or resin cement used within the IDS procedure. A comprehensive database search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Ovid Medline, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library, Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source, and ProQuest was carried out up to 30 January 2024 without publication year or language limitations. Only in vitro full-texts regarding the effect of IDS on bond strength were included, and the quality of their methods was assessed via a Risk of Bias (RoB) test. In total, 1023 pertinent studies were initially found, and 60 articles were selected for review after screening for the title, abstract, and full texts. IDS application improves the bond strength of indirect restorations to dentin and reduces the negative effects of temporary materials on the bond durability of final indirect restorations.

02761797e830400b00894cb70be1415e04255407,A multi-state evaluation of extreme risk protection orders: a research protocol,"Background Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs) are civil court orders that prohibit firearm purchase and possession when someone is behaving dangerously and is at risk of harming themselves and/or others. As of June 2024, ERPOs are available in 21 states and the District of Columbia to prevent firearm violence. This paper describes the design and protocol of a six-state study of ERPO use. Methods The six states included are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, and Washington. During the 3-year project period (2020–2023), ERPO case files were obtained through public records requests or through agreements with agencies with access to these data in each state. A team of over four dozen research assistants from seven institutions coded 6628 ERPO cases, abstracting 80 variables per case under domains related to respondent characteristics, events and behaviors leading to ERPO petitions, petitioner types, and court outcomes. Research assistants received didactic training through an online learning management system that included virtual training modules, quizzes, practice coding exercises, and two virtual synchronous sessions. A protocol for gaining strong interrater reliability was used. Research assistants also learned strategies for reducing the risk of experiencing secondary trauma through the coding process, identifying its occurrence, and obtaining help. Discussion Addressing firearm violence in the U.S. is a priority. Understanding ERPO use in these six states can inform implementation planning and ERPO uptake, including promising opportunities to enhance safety and prevent firearm-related injuries and deaths. By publishing this protocol, we offer detailed insight into the methods underlying the papers published from these data, and the process of managing data abstraction from ERPO case files across the multi-state and multi-institution teams involved. Such information may also inform future analyses of this data, and future replication efforts. Registration This protocol is registered on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/kv4fc/).

Over the 72-year period from 1952 to 2024, 1200 neurosurgeons have been trained and distributed in 31 provinces in Iran, attaining a ratio of 1.4/100 000 population. All but 40 neurosurgeons were trained after 1981, which coincided with the Iran-Iraq War. Decentralization of medical and neurosurgical residency training programs, resolving the immediate need for neurosurgeons managing penetrating traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries during the 1980 to 1988 Iran-Iraq War, and active participation of legislative and executive branches of government in solving health care disparities were major factors in meeting the needs of the country. At the present time, more than 555 neurosurgeons are practicing in Tehran Province, a proportion of 3.8 neurosurgeons for every 100 000 population, which indicates an element of disparity in density distribution across Iranian land.


CONCLUSION
Legislative initiatives and government support of public health care delivery and decentralization of medical and residency training programs after the Iran-Iraq War and introduction of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education are considered the main reasons for the relative success in meeting the neurosurgical demand and manpower density. Still, further adjustment of distribution of manpower is needed.",Neurosurgery,2024.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1227/neu.0000000000003253?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000003253, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e609236cf9d6f0b038e50015fae33206bea9afd1,A Systematic Review of the Effect of Stigmatization on Psychiatric Illness Outcomes,"A significant proportion of individuals with psychiatric disorders face dual challenges such as managing the symptoms and disabilities of their conditions and enduring stigma arising from misconceptions about mental illness. This stigma denies them quality-of-life opportunities, such as access to satisfactory healthcare services, better employment, safer housing, and social affiliations. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effect of stigmatization on psychiatric illness outcomes, particularly its influence on treatment adherence, treatment-seeking behavior, and care outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of 39 studies published between 2010 and 2024, focusing on the effects of stigmatization on psychiatric illness outcomes. The review utilized robust methodology following Cochrane guidance and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, including studies from 2010 to 2024 obtained from databases such as PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and SCOPUS. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies, with most studies rated as moderate to high quality. The findings indicate that stigma in psychiatric illness is closely associated with several factors, including illness duration (mean effect size = 0.42, p < 0.05), frequency of clinic visits (mean reduction = 2.3 visits/year), and diagnosis of psychotic disorders (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.20-2.65). Stigma manifests through misinformation, prejudice, and discrimination, leading to significant barriers to accessing and adhering to psychiatric treatment, thereby worsening health outcomes. It leads to delays in accessing healthcare, poor adherence to medication and follow-up, and negative psychiatric health outcomes, including disempowerment, reduced self-efficacy, increased psychiatric symptoms, and decreased quality of life. Also, stigma extends to caregivers and healthcare professionals, complicating care delivery. This review highlights the need for effective interventions and strategies to address stigma, emphasizing the importance of educational interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of public stigma. Understanding the multifaceted nature of stigma is crucial for developing targeted approaches to improve psychiatric care outcomes and ensure better mental health services for individuals with mental illnesses.",Cureus,2024.0,7,"{'url': 'https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/review_article/pdf/255768/20240619-14600-a5883e.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258934, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

99cd69f6023283c3735667dfaa9e2efbafe0df46,Association between primary hypothyroidism and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: an updated meta-analysis,"Objective Epidemiological studies have reported an association between primary hypothyroidism and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, the magnitude of the risk and whether this risk changes with the severity of MASLD remains uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis of observational studies to quantify the magnitude of the association between primary hypothyroidism and the risk of MASLD. Design We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science from database inception to 31 January 2024, using predefined keywords to identify observational studies in which MASLD was diagnosed by liver biopsy, imaging or International Classification of Diseases codes. A meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modelling. Results We identified 24 cross-sectional and 4 longitudinal studies with aggregate data on ~76.5 million individuals. Primary hypothyroidism (defined as levothyroxine replacement treatment, subclinical hypothyroidism or overt hypothyroidism) was associated with an increased risk of prevalent MASLD (n=24 studies; random-effects OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.66; I2=89%). Hypothyroidism was also associated with a substantially higher risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis or advanced fibrosis (n=5 studies; random-effects OR 2.84, 95% CI 2.07 to 3.90; I2=0%). Meta-analysis of data from four longitudinal studies showed that there was a marginally non-significant association between hypothyroidism and risk of developing MASLD over a median 4.5-year follow-up (random-effects HR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97; I2=85%). Sensitivity analyses did not modify these findings. The funnel plot did not reveal any significant publication bias. Conclusion This large and updated meta-analysis provides evidence that primary hypothyroidism is significantly associated with both an increased presence of and histological severity of MASLD.",Gut,2024.0,7,"{'url': 'https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490356/1/Association_Between_Hypothyroidism_and_Metabolic_Dysfunction_R1_marked_copy.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1136/gutjnl-2024-332491?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2024-332491, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

777e21eac10ea5b6fd5cf39a4b5cf744591de4c8,Comparative Clinical Behavior of Zirconia versus Titanium Dental Implants: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Objective: The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether there were clinically relevant differences in the treatment of edentulous areas comparing zirconia (Zr) and titanium (Ti) dental implants. The null hypothesis is that no differences can be observed in terms of the clinical parameters; the positive hypothesis I is that Zr implants have generally better results compared to Ti implants; and the positive hypothesis II is that Ti implants have a generally superior result than Zr implants. Methods: This review work was registered on the PROSPERO platform, and its development was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The electronic search process was conducted on three databases (PubMed/Scopus/Web of Science), including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the past 10 years (up to April 2024). Identified articles were analyzed and included/excluded based on pre-defined selection and exclusion criteria. The quality assessment and risk of bias were evaluated using a Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool specifically designed for randomized trials (RoB2). A meta-analysis was conducted to correlate different treatment options based on the described outcomes; a random-effects model was used in the analysis of the variables. The analysis of heterogeneity was conducted by means of Cochran’s Q-test and Higgins’ I2 statistic. Results: Six RCTs were enrolled; 152 patients (90 males and 62 females) and 448 implants (267 Zr and 181 Ti) were included. Dental implant placement involved both the maxillary and mandibular arches. The implant sites showed heterogeneity in receiving Zr and Ti dental implants; in particular, 22 dental implants were placed in the mid-palatal region and 426 dental implants in the alveolar region (255 were in Zr and 171 in Ti). Regarding the success rate, it was better for Zr but with no statistical difference (p > 0.05); bleeding on probing had slight differences between Ti with 0.34% ± 0.42 and Zr with 0.26% ± 0.36 (p > 0.05); plaque score showed 0.46 ± 0.47 for Ti compared to 0.44 ± 0.49 for Zr (p > 0.05); no statistically significant difference was observed for pink esthetic score (PES). Statistically significant results were found for survival rate, which favored Ti implants (77.6%) compared to Zr (70.3%) (p < 0.05), and for marginal bone loss, which showed less loss in Ti implants (0.18 mm ± 0.47) compared to 0.42 mm ± 0.40 in Zr at 12 months (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The present systematic review and meta-analysis identified the positive hypothesis I and rejected the null and positive hypothesis II; it was possible to conclude that Ti dental implants have a better survival rate and less marginal bone loss than Zr dental implants after 1-year follow-up.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,2024.0,4,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13154488', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11313197, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2529131a296596f9b324a2801e0d2bc3f18ef678,Global research on RNA vaccines for COVID-19 from 2019 to 2023: a bibliometric analysis,"Background Since the global pandemic of COVID-19 has broken out, thousands of pieces of literature on COVID-19 RNA vaccines have been published in various journals. The overall measurement and analysis of RNA vaccines for COVID-19, with the help of sophisticated mathematical tools, could provide deep insights into global research performance and the collaborative architectural structure within the scientific community of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. In this bibliometric analysis, we aim to determine the extent of the scientific output related to COVID-19 RNA vaccines between 2019 and 2023. Methods We applied the Bibliometrix R package for comprehensive science mapping analysis of extensive bibliographic metadata retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. On January 11th, 2024, the Web of Science database was searched for COVID-19 RNA vaccine-related publications using predetermined search keywords with specific restrictions. Bradford’s law was applied to evaluate the core journals in this field. The data was analyzed with various bibliometric indicators using the Bibliometrix R package. Results The final analysis included 2962 publications published between 2020 and 2023 while there is no related publication in 2019. The most productive year was 2022. The most relevant leading authors in terms of publications were Ugur Sahin and Pei-Yong, Shi, who had the highest total citations in this field. The core journals were Vaccines, Frontiers in Immunology, and Viruses-Basel. The most frequently used author’s keywords were COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and vaccine. Recent COVID-19 RNA vaccine-related topics included mental health, COVID-19 vaccines in humans, people, and the pandemic. Harvard University was the top-ranked institution. The leading country in terms of publications, citations, corresponding author country, and international collaboration was the United States. The United States had the most robust collaboration with China. Conclusion The research hotspots include COVID-19 vaccines and the pandemic in people.

With the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, the corresponding number of survivors is also expected to rise. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has specifically addressed the gender differences in neurological symptoms of long-COVID. Methods: We included studies on female individuals who presented with specific neurological symptoms at least 12 weeks after confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from PubMed, Central, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search limit was put for after 01/2020 until 15/06/2024. We excluded studies that did not provide sex-specific outcome data, those not in English, case reports, case series, and review articles. Results: A total of 5632 eligible articles were identified. This article provides relevant information from 12 studies involving 6849 patients, of which 3414 were female. The sample size ranged from 70 to 2856, with a maximum follow-up period of 18 months. The earliest publication date was 16/09/2021 while the latest was 11/06/2024. The following neurological symptoms had significant difference in risk ratio (RR) for female gender: fatigue RR 1.40 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22 - 1.60, p<0.001), headache RR 1.37 (95% CI: 1.12 - 1.67, p=0.002), brain-fog RR 1.38 (95% CI 1.08-1.76, p=0.011) depression RR 1.49 (95% CI: 1.2 - 1.86, p<0.001), and anosmia RR 1.61 (95% CI: 1.36 - 1.90, p<0.001). high heterogenicity was found for fatigue, brain fog, and anxiety due to the diverse methodologies employed in the studies. Conclusion- Our findings suggest that women are at a higher risk for long-COVID neurological symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, brain fog, depression, and anosmia, compared to men.

Methods A systematic search of the Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases was conducted, covering publications from January 2013 to September 2024, to identify studies evaluating changes in clinical scores and gait parameters in patients undergoing TKA or UKA. Following stringent selection criteria, data were synthesized from studies involving 171 TKA and 148 UKA patients, focusing on reported gait outcomes and aggregating findings for comprehensive analysis. Direct comparisons between TKA and UKA were performed to assess differences in clinical scores and gait parameters, aiming to elucidate the relative efficacy of each surgical approach and provide robust evidence for clinical decision-making. Results Ten studies met the inclusion criteria for post-operative gait outcome comparisons between TKA and UKA, with seven studies also addressing clinical scores. One study reported greater improvement in WOMAC scores for the UKA group at 6 months post-operation (P < 0.05), while another found superior EQ-5D scores for UKA patients at 1 year post-surgery (P < 0.05). Conversely, five studies found no significant differences in clinical scores between groups at 1 year (P > 0.05). All ten studies assessed gait parameter recovery, with three studies showing no significant differences at 1 year (P > 0.05). However, seven studies identified superior gait recovery in the UKA group across various parameters, including walking speed, step and stride length, single support time, heel strike force, knee joint range of motion, knee flexion angles during different gait phases, peak knee adduction moment, peak tibial internal rotation moment, gait symmetry, and stride length symmetry (P < 0.05). Conclusions The analysis indicates that UKA offers certain advantages in post-operative gait improvements compared to TKA, though these do not translate into significant differences in conventional clinical scoring systems.

 Introduction
 
 The conference is organized by the Faculty of Power Engineering and Power Machines at the Technical University of Sofia, Bulgaria. This is the 29th annual edition of the event, part of the “Days of Science” activities at the Technical University of Sofia. For the past 29 years, this conference has become a traditional annual scientific forum for the meeting of Bulgarian and foreign experts and industry representatives in the field of energy and renewable energy technologies, thermodynamics, heat engineering, building efficiency improvements and HVAC systems, environmental engineering and protection, hydraulics and pneumatics, textile and sewing production.
 All received publications are peer reviewed and traditionally, the highest quality scientific papers are further submitted for publishing in referenced partnering journals. Based on recent years of experience, the conference offers on-site and online possibility for attendance. The program includes keynote lectures from selected popular topics in the presented areas, as well as oral presentations of the papers by the participants. It became a tradition, for some of the main sponsors, to organize special demonstration stalls in the conference area, where they can expose their latest innovative products and have a closer meeting with the audience.
 This year, three exhibitions were organized and performed as side events, during the conference days. The first one is continuation of the last year event, called “Eco-aeSTHETICS 2.0: Humanizing technology”, and it is an exposition of nine woodcrafter sculpture artists, developing the “energy concept” in their work. The second exposition presented students’ design ideas for devices or technologies for green and sustainable energy utilization. The last exhibition was devoted to the technical and industrial sponsors of the InnoEE 2024 conference. It included a demonstration of the recent products of the Hexonic company and Tapflo, mainly heat exchangers and special industrial pumps. Also, main attraction of this exhibition were the several demonstration cars with hybrid and electric drive, delivered by Toyota. The participants of this year event had the opportunity to get closer look of these newest Toyota models and even to have a test drive, during the conference days.

The study was conducted using a case study, which is one of the qualitative research methods. In the 2023–2024 academic year, the study group consisted of 16 preschool teachers working in a province in the Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. The researcher developed a semi-structured interview form and used researcher diaries as data collection tools. An inductive content analysis approach described the data from the interviews with the participating teachers and the research diaries. The findings revealed that most of the teachers thought that ChatGPT was suitable for preschool education due to its potential, such as creating personalized and creative activities and suggesting games and stories. However, negative opinions about potential problems such as obtaining misinformation, technology addiction, decreased social interaction, and deriving age-inappropriate content were also identified. Teachers agreed that ChatGPT has potential in terms of language development, individual learning support, development of creativity, fast access to information, and story creation, but they also had a common opinion that it can be harmful, such as increasing screen time, reducing social interaction, and not fully supporting emotional and social aspects. For successful integration at the pre-school level, technical requirements such as tablets and computers may be needed, as well as teacher trainings, a guide on how to use ChatGPT effectively, and information for parents.

This cross-sectional study looked at the attitudes, thoughts, and understanding of healthcare students toward AI. Materials and methods During the academic year 2023-2024, medical students enrolled in the College of Medicine and Health Sciences (CMHS) at the Arabian Gulf University (AGU) were included in this study. A questionnaire was developed to evaluate their understanding and opinions regarding the use of AI in medical training. These data were gathered, categorized, and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 29 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US). Categorical variables were shown in the form of frequencies and percentages, whereas continuous variables were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). Chi-square tests were utilized for comparing categorical variables. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The study found that n=41 (27%) of medical students are very familiar with AI applications while n=92 (60.5%) are somewhat familiar. Familiarity increases as students progress in their medical education, with senior clinical phase students more familiar than juniors. There was no significant difference in perceptions of AI application among medical phases. Familiarity with research methodology and studies increases familiarity with AI applications. Most students believe AI will have a positive impact on medical education, but perceptions vary by educational phase. Many students support integrating AI into curricula with 67 (44.1%) of students using AI applications, with a higher percentage in pre-clinical phases, likely due to application in research projects in this phase. Concerns were raised about AI impacting the human touch in medical practice and doctor-patient communication, as well as technical challenges faced by students when applying AI.

44b4ec1d6f4738fbe94b9cef2d3dafaa298f9777,Assessing knowledge and awareness of Food and Drug Interactions among nutrition sciences students: Implications for education and clinical practice.,"BACKGROUND
Chronic diseases and polymedication increase the risk of food-drug interactions (FDIs) among the population, negatively impacting health. Nutritionists, as responsible for dietary planning, have a key role in preventing these events.


AIM
To assess the knowledge about FDIs among a sample of Nutrition Sciences Bachelor students.


METHODS
A descriptive cross-sectional observational study was conducted, involving 44 students from the 3rd and 4th academic years of different Portuguese universities during the 2023/2024 academic year. Participants completed a self-reported questionnaire, covering general and specific FDIs knowledge, academic background, and perceptions regarding FDIs importance and training adequacy.


RESULTS
Results revealed a general lack of FDIs knowledge among participants, particularly in identifying specific interactions and appropriate dietary management. While half of the students reported exposure to a subject dedicated to FDIs, only 18.18% considered the knowledge acquired sufficient. Nearly all participants (93.18%) expressed the need for further training in FDIs during their undergraduate course. Furthermore, none of the participants had received additional training or attended workshops on FDIs. Specifically, participants struggled to identify appropriate dietary choices in conjunction with certain medications. Moreover, only a minority of participants demonstrated awareness of the ideal timing for medication intake relative to food consumption. Despite these knowledge gaps, participants recognized the importance of FDIs knowledge for future clinical practice.


CONCLUSION
Bridging these knowledge gaps through targeted educational interventions and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to ensure future nutrition professionals are equipped to address the complex challenges posed by FDIs in professional practice.",Nutrition and Health,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/02601060241263409?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/02601060241263409, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. The study sample size was 145 MD3 year college of medicine students for the academic year 2023–2024. The evaluation instruments included the participants’ exam grades, pre-test scores, post-test scores, and feedback. The study employed a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative research methods to investigate how students perceived and interacted with the bingo game-based activity. The data were analyzed by Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26. The association between exam and post-test scores was examined using the correlation coefficient and a straightforward regression analysis. The P value of less than 0.05 was deemed significant. RESULTS: The study comprised 145 students in total who completed all the tasks. The post-test scores (10.62 ± 1.73) showed a statistically significant improvement (P < 0.01) over the pre-test scores (6.3 ± 1.99). Most students (85–90%) thought that activities centered around bingo games were great tools for learning. Nine out of ten students said the game-based activity was engaging and enjoyable, that it inspired them to engage in group discussions, that it assisted them in identifying and concentrating on important topics, and that it improved their knowledge and helped them get ready for the final exam. Almost all the participants (>90%) suggested adding this exercise to the list of future topics. Overall, exam scores achieved by students for topics covered in the bingo-based activity (92.7 ± 4.96) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than exam scores for topics not covered in the activity (83.75 ± 7.74). CONCLUSION: Bingo game is an effective learning strategy to promote students’ learning in the immunology course.

979371db702f33701a7c0c0da2ee654e7482d75c,Evolution of Educational Leadership: A Bibliometric Analysis of International Publications,"Abstract Research on educational leadership has received significant scholarly attention for over half a century, resulting in a vast body of literature on the subject. Numerous studies and inquiries have highlighted that educational leadership is an exceedingly complex and vital phenomenon. However, a gap persists in scholarly discourse concerning the presentation of this knowledge base through bibliometric analysis. This study seeks to provide an overview of the evolution of this concept by identifying articles published in journals indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS) database between 1993 and 2024. The search employed terms such as ""educational leadership"", „educational management” ""leadership in education,"" ""school leadership”, „teacher leadership”, „style leadership in education” and „school improvement”yielding an initial total of 3089 articles. Subsequently, following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 1583 studies were retained for analysis. The research encompasses the general profile of articles, the annual distribution of article frequency, the most prolific researchers, journals, and countries by article count, the most influential articles based on citation count, the most frequently recurring author keywords, and the year of publication of these articles. The contribution of this study lies primarily in highlighting the systematic methodologies employed in research analyses in educational leadership and management. Additionally, collaborative patterns among authors, universities, and countries are presented and analyzed. The conclusions provide valuable insights for researchers into the detailed evolution of educational leadership through the structuring of existing literature in the field. Furthermore, based on these findings, some suggestions have been made for identifying new research themes in this field, both conceptually and empirically.",Proceedings of the International Conference on Business Excellence,2024.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2478/picbe-2024-0206?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2478/picbe-2024-0206, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A Systematic Review,"Introduction: Corticosteroid injections have demonstrated short-term benefits for shoulder pain. This symptomatic treatment method is used in various inflammatory conditions that affect the shoulder joint. Corticosteroid joint injections are not without risks and complications. Adverse effects have been documented, including damage to the articular cartilage, tendon rupture, and attenuation of the subject’s immune response. The aim of this study was to examine the timing of preoperative corticosteroid injections on infectious outcomes of shoulder arthroscopies and shoulder arthroplasty. Materials and Methods: In accordance with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), the PubMed, Cochrane, and Science Direct databases were systematically reviewed by two independent authors in January 2024. After full-text reading and checking the reference lists, 11 article were included. Results: Patients who received a shoulder injection within three months prior to undergoing shoulder arthroplasty exhibited a markedly elevated incidence of infection. In addition, a significantly increased risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) at 90 days postoperatively in patients who received CSIs (corticosteroid injections) within 1 month prior to shoulder arthroplasty was found. Different authors consider CSI injections within the 2 weeks prior to shoulder arthroscopy surgery principally associated with an increased risk of postoperative infection. Discussion: There is still no consensus on the correct timing of preoperative CSIs in both arthroscopic and arthroplasty procedures. The literature does not identify whether the number of preoperative injections could increase the risk of periprosthetic infection. Obesity, sex, and smoking did not have a significant effect on PJIs; alcohol abuse could be considered as a risk factor for PJIs with CSIs. Both in prosthetic surgeries and in arthroscopy procedures, modifiable and unmodifiable factors play secondary roles. The risk of postoperative infection is greater within 3 months, although it is almost comparable at one- and two-year follow-ups.",Healthcare,2024.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/5/543/pdf?version=1708776801', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10931120, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1f21ffd896a3d46c81825dd48fdbf907ce05a342,The association between the stress hyperglycaemia ratio and mortality in cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis and systematic review,"Background A raised stress hyperglycaemia ratio (SHR) has been associated with all-cause mortality and may better discriminate than an absolute glucose value. The aim of this meta analysis and systematic review is to synthesise the evidence assessing the relationship between the SHR and all-cause mortality across three common cardiovascular presentations. Methods We undertook a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Web of Science from the date of inception to 1st March 2024, and selected articles meeting the following criteria: studies of patients hospitalised for acute myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke or acute heart failure reporting the risk (odds ratio or hazard ratio) for all-cause mortality associated with the SHR. A random effects model was used for primary analysis. Subgroup analysis by diabetes status and of mortality in the short and long term was undertaken. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Newcastle Ottawa quality assessment scale. Results A total of 32 studies were included: 26 studies provided 31 estimates for the meta-analysis. The total study population in the meta analysis was 80,010. Six further studies were included in the systematic review. Participants admitted to hospital with cardiovascular disease and an SHR in the highest category had a significantly higher risk ratio of all-cause mortality in both the short and longer term compared with those with a lower SHR (RR = 1.67 [95% CI 1.46–1.91], p < 0.001). This finding was driven by studies in the myocardial infarction (RR = 1.75 [95% CI 1.52–2.01]), and ischaemic stroke cohorts (RR = 1.78 [95% CI 1.26–2.50]). The relationship was present amongst those with and without diabetes (diabetes: RR 1.49 [95% CI 1.14–1.94], p < 0.001, no diabetes: RR 1.85 [95% CI 1.49–2.30], p < 0.001) with p = 0.21 for subgroup differences, and amongst studies that reported mortality as a single outcome (RR of 1.51 ([95% CI 1.29–1.77]; p < 0.001) and those that reported mortality as part of a composite outcome (RR 2.02 [95% CI 1.58–2.59]; p < 0.001). On subgroup analysis by length of follow up, higher SHR values were associated with increased risk of mortality at 90 day, 1 year and > 1year follow up, with risk ratios of 1.84 ([95% CI 1.32–2.56], p < 0.001), 1.69 ([95% CI 1.32–2.16], p < 0.001) and 1.58 ([95% CI 1.34–1.86], p < 0.001) respectively. Conclusions A raised SHR is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality following myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. Further work is required to define reference values for the SHR, and to investigate the potential effects of relative hypoglycaemia. Interventional trials targeting to the SHR rather than the absolute glucose value should be undertaken.

Methods: Up to May 26, 2024, the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature, China Science and Technology Journal, and Wanfang were searched, and the randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of osimertinib plus bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC were included. Two researchers independently screened the literature, assessed the quality of the included literature, and extracted the literature data. Revman5.4 software was used for meta-analysis. Results: A total of 824 patients were included in 10 RCTs. The results of meta-analysis showed that compared with the control group (osimertinib alone), the experimental group (osimertinib plus bevacizumab) had a higher objective response rate (ORR) (relative risk [RR] = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03–1.47, P = .02), and the experimental group could significantly reduce the expression levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (mean difference [SMD] = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.30–1.35, P = .002), vascular endothelial growth factor (SMD = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.13–0.73, P = .005), neuron-specific enolase (SMD = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.60–1.17, P < .00001), cytokeratin 19 fragments (SMD = 1.33, 95% CI = 0.34–2.33, P = .009), and carbohydrate antigen 125 (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.15–0.77, P = .004) in serum. However, the experimental group did not significantly improve the disease control rate (DCR) (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.00–1.36, P = .05), 1- and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates (RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.00–1.33, P = .05; RR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.74–1.40, P = .92), 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates (RR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.92–1.36, P = .28; RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.84–1.18, P = .95). Interestingly, the results of subgroup analysis showed that the experimental group significantly improved ORR, DCR, 1-year PFS, and OS rates in the Chinese population and patients under 65 years old (P < .05). In addition, when the dose of bevacizumab was 7.5 mg/kg q3w in the experimental group, ORR, DCR, 1-year PFS, and OS rates were significantly better than those in the control group (P < .05). In terms of adverse events of drugs, the incidence of proteinuria, hypertension, oral mucositis, bleeding, nausea, and vomiting in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group (P < .05). Conclusion: For patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, osimertinib plus bevacizumab has some clinical benefit compared with osimertinib alone. Still, it does not provide additional long-term survival benefits and has higher toxicity. More well-designed, multicenter RCTs are needed to identify the subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from this combination regimen and to validate the optimal dose of this combination regimen.",Medicine,2024.0,2,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000040320', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11557104, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Oil palm small-scale farmers in many countries including Tanzania, need agricultural information for improving agricultural production. Through different sources of agricultural information, oil palm small-scale farmers acquire useful knowledge to alleviate agricultural production challenges. Though many countries including Tanzania have agricultural information infrastructures, still oil palm small-scale farmers do not obtain enough agricultural information. This study was conducted in year 2024, and aimed to determine small-scale farmers’ information needs and sources for improved oil palm production in Kigoma-Ujiji Municipal Council, Tanzania. Through the use of a structured questionnaire, 120 randomly selected oil palm small-scale farmers from the following three wards were interviewed: Kagera, Businde, and Kibirizi. Checklists of questions were used in conducting key informant interviews. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 20 software. Chi-square analysis helped to find the level of association between the information needs and areas of residence at 5 percent significant level. The study found that, majority (95.0%) of the oil palm small-scale farmers needed information on markets and prices, 67.5 percent sourced information from friends and fellow farmers, and 35.0 percent shared information through facial interaction.

Since then, ICP atomic emission spectrometry has become one of the most widely used analytical methods in the world. ICP is obtained using semiconductor or vacuum tube generators with frequency of 27.12 or 40.68 MHz. The emission spectra of the analyzed solutions are recorded using spectral instruments with crossed dispersion (echelle spectrometer) with a matrix detector or with polychromators built according to the Paschen-Runge scheme, assemblies of detector lines. To solve the problem of import substitution, serial production of Russian atomic emission spectrometer Grand-ICP (No. 89108-23 in the state register of measuring instruments of the Russian Federation) has been developed and launched; and the aim of this work is presenting analytical characteristics of this instrument.
ICP is obtained using a self-excited RF generator (40.68 MHz) based on a generator triode. Plasma is maintained in a vertically installed three-stream semi-dismountable quartz burner. The spectral device based on the Paschen-Runge scheme records the spectrum simultaneously in the range from 160 to 780 nm using BLPP-4000 detector arrays with the resolution of 15 pm in the range of 160–190 nm, 8 pm for 190–350 nm, and 25 pm for 350–780 nm. The spectrometer implements axial, radial and double plasma viewing.
Grand-ICP spectrometer is not inferior to the foreign analogues in its analytical characteristics: elements detection limits (3σ) ≤ 1 μg/l; long-term stability of analytical signals is characterized by an RSD (relative standard deviation) of less than 2 % for analytes and less than 1 % for Ar lines; the linearity range of the calibration dependencies is more than 106 when using a double plasma viewing and more than 107 when using multiple lines. Grand-ICP spectrometer was successfully tested by employees of laboratories of industrial enterprises in the Russian Federation and in scientific institutes of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.",Аналитика и контроль,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.15826/analitika.2024.28.4.003', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15826/analitika.2024.28.4.003?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15826/analitika.2024.28.4.003, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c3b5708bb8e5fa61acd253b7fc6dcb905d8bff31,Boson bloom,"The year 2024 marks the 100th anniversary of the first article on Bose statistics. Bose breathed life into the Planck distribution of radiation by a microscopic derivation (Bose 1924 Z. Phys. 26 178), adding a new insight, namely indistinguishability into the then evolving quantum theory. Einstein recognized the importance of this article and got it published. Using Bose statistics Einstein wrote an article on the theory (Einstein 1924 Sutzungsber. Preuss. Akad. Wiss Phys.-Math Kl. 261) of an ideal Bose gas and Bose–Einstein condensation. The groundbreaking discovery of Bose, an unveiling of a secret of quantum mechanics, continues to reverberate after a century. Bose’s paper is considered the fourth important paper in old quantum theory, following Planck’s (1900) article (Planck 1900 Verh. Disch Phys. Ges. 2 202), Einstein’s (1905) photoelectric effect (Einstein 1905 Ann. Phys., Lpz. 17 132) and Bohr’s model (1913) of the atom (Bohr 1913 London, Edinburgh Dublin Phil. Mag. J. Sci. 26 1). Dirac (1926 Proc. R. Soc. A 112 661) coined the name boson for one of the two families of indistinguishable particles, the other family being fermion. The edifice of modern quantum field theory, many-body quantum theory, quantum-information and quantum-computing are built on bosons, fermions and anyons. The ever-blooming quantum garden of bosons has photons, gluons, W-bosons, mesons, Higgs-bosons, gravitons, phonons, magnons, excitons, plasmons, polaritons and so on. We present a brief historical account of Bose’s life and his discovery, followed by a bird’s eye view of the impacts of bosons in modern science and technology: from Bose’s distribution of 3-degree background radiation reaching us in the form of cosmic microwave background from the big bang era to boson sampling, a novel quantum computing method.

Combining conceptual metaphor analysis and qualitative frame analysis, they explore how Austrian newspapers portrayed the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020. Building on the distinction between rhetorical and technical devices of journalistic framing, the article suggests considering metaphors as an additional “reasoning device.” Thus, ontological metaphors emphasized the fragility of the collective “we,” needing to stand together while guarding the distance.

Rather than resigning our aspirations, we need more nuanced and integrative understanding of self-regulation abilities and change. Methods Launching in 2024, SPROUTS is a 3-year longitudinal study of early self-regulation, beginning in the pre-school period (3–5 years old at Wave 1) with retrospective data back to birth and annual data collection across the transition to school period (ages 5–7 years at Wave 3). Data will be collected on children’s self-regulation, related abilities, outcomes, as well as prior and current contexts. One nested study within each Wave–that contributes complementary insights via supplementary and in-depth methods and data–will enable further exploration of contemporary issues related to self-regulation. Discussion Insights generated can potentiate more effective intervention and education efforts by: improving intervention cost-benefit ratios; identifying likely mechanisms of change; easing burdens of unhealthy and antisocial behaviours associated with low self-regulation; and, most importantly, contributing to giving children the best early start to life. These benefits are timely in the context of intense policy and educational interest in fostering children’s self-regulation. Trial Registration Open Science Framework: osf.io/maqdg.

9ab3e09846ae3911563ec40ed59da2fb3c86d35b,Osteoplastic biomaterials from organic and mineral components of the bone matrix: a literature review,"Introduction. The bones of the human and animal have a unique ability to remodel. The ability to constantly renew bone tissue determines the healing of fractures and the adaptation of bones to mechanical loads. However, the process of bone self-healing is effective only for defects of non-critical size. In segmental and critical defects, endogenous stimulation of bone tissue regeneration is required. In this regard, there remains a need to design osteoplastic biomaterials with improved pro-regenerative action. Every year, new data appear that expand our understanding of the methods and mechanisms for stimulating bone tissue restoration using artificial osteoplastic materials. 
Aim. Characteristics of modern methods of constructing biomimetic materials from organic and mineral components of bone matrix. 
Materials and methods. The literature review was conducted using the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases. Query dates — may–july 2024, query depth — 1965–2024. 
Main content of the review. Effective use of bone polymers for the creation of biomimetic osteoplastic materials is possible only with an understanding of the principles of molecular-cellular interaction of biopolymers with bone cells and tissues. By now, it has been established that the ability of collagen to influence the functional activity of cells involved in the reparative regeneration of bone tissue is due to the presence of special patterns in its structure - binding sites with cellular receptors, which are formed by a specific sequence of amino acids in the collagen polypeptide chain. In the case of inorganic bone material, the functionally significant elements are the chemical composition and crystal structure of calcium phosphate salts. A current trend in the design of osteoplastic materials is to impart biomimetic properties to them. At the molecular level, this approach is implemented using as intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization of collagen fibrils. At the tissue and organ level, biomimicry is achieved through the use of three-dimensional bioprinting technologies. 
Conclusion. Thus, thanks to advances in biology, physics, chemistry and engineering sciences, it was possible to develop new technologies for designing osteoplastic materials that imitate the structure and function of native bone tissue. The use of biomaterials created using biomimetics principles increases the efficiency of bone tissue damage restoration.",Bulletin of Rehabilitation Medicine,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38025/2078-1962-2024-23-5-97-107?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38025/2078-1962-2024-23-5-97-107, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 Irrational beliefs are among the significant factors that contribute to self-harming behaviors and the quality of life. This study aims to examine irrational beliefs and their association with the quality of life among students at Jiroft University of Medical Sciences in southern Iran in 2024.
 
 
 
 This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study was conducted in 2024 on 290 students enrolled in the second semester of the 2023-2024 academic year at Jiroft University of Medical Sciences (including the faculties of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, and Paramedicine) in southern Iran. Standardized questionnaires on irrational beliefs and quality of life were used for data collection. T-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlation coefficients were applied to the data analyzed by SPSS 23 software (α= 0.05).
 
 
 
 The mean and standard deviation of irrational beliefs and quality of life were 337.56 ± 22.37 out of 500 and 57.71 ± 14.63 out of 120, respectively, indicating moderate and low levels for these two variables. A statistically significant correlation was observed between students' irrational beliefs and their quality of life (p < 0.001, r = -0.543).
 
 
 
 Irrational beliefs in students were estimated at a moderate level, and quality of life at a low level. It is suggested that the authorities in charge of the university's students, advisory, and cultural affairs provide the conditions to improve the quality of life of students, pay attention to their needs, and try to solve their problems to reduce their irrational beliefs.

Research method – To achieve the aim, the use of a direct method – a questionnaire was required. The results of empirical research from years 2009–2024 conducted in the Podkarpackie Voivodeship are presented. These studies have been carried out systematically since 2009, excluding 2021 – due to the Covid-19 pandemic and difficulties in directly reaching respondents. Every year, 1,300 surveys are sent to households, but the level of their return varies, which caused the different research samples in the period 2009–2024. Results – Among the people participating in the study, there was a predominance of supporters of progressive taxation as a form which is more consistent with fair taxation in the opinion of the respondents. The widespread acceptance of tax progression indicates a strongly rooted sense of vertical justice in Polish society, according to which, higher taxes should be paid by the richer, while the income of less wealthy people should be taxed at lower rates. Originality / value / implications / recommendations – The article presents the essence of tax fairness, which has had a permanent place in tax science and tax practice for years. It is an important and still topical issue, because the results of the previous experience indicate that many issues are debatable, but also raise new questions.

10dd0af5e2e36eb29f291136573bd9428caaca14,Shaping the future of translation careers: Student interest and the need for curriculum reform in the AI era,"This study explores students’ interest in pursuing a career in translation in the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and the growing need for translation curriculum reform. A mixed method was employed, involving 45 students from the English Literature Department at the University of Technology Yogyakarta (UTY) during the 2023-2024 academic year. Participants were selected using a stratified random sampling technique and included second-, third-, and fourth-year students. Data collection was conducted through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The questionnaire assessed students’ interest in translation careers, while the interview provided deeper insight, involving six respondents from the three batches, representing both positive and negative responses to the questionnaire items. The findings indicate that 26,6% of respondents are interested in a translation career, 55,6% are neutral, and 15,53% are not interested. Neutral responses were most common among second-year students and least common among fourth-year students, likely because higher-year students tend to focus more on career planning. The study also highlights the need to reform translation curricula by integrating machine translation into classroom instruction, as a computer assisted as well as automatic. The findings of this study suggest the need for further research on developing an AI-based model for teaching translation.",English Language Teaching Educational Journal,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.12928/eltej.v7i3.12016?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.12928/eltej.v7i3.12016, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Dental caries cause pain, infection and negatively impact quality of life. As part of population oral health improvement efforts in Saudi Arabia, this project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a supervised toothbrushing programme in kindergartens. Methods and analysis This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial. Enrolment began in September 2022, for two academic years (2022–2024) on 20 randomly selected kindergartens in Riyadh. The data collection phase will be completed in September 2024. Ten kindergartens are randomly allocated to supervised toothbrushing and 10 to treatment as usual, which is an annual oral health awareness visit. The primary endpoint will be the worsening of obvious decay experience as measured by decayed (into dentine), missing and filled teeth (d3mft) from baseline to the second year of follow-up. The secondary endpoint will be the increase in the number of teeth affected. A priori subgroups of the region of Riyadh, school type (public, private), child sex and presence/absence of prior decay at baseline, will be analysed. We require 244 evaluable endpoints using a power of 80% to meet the sample size requirement. In addition, questionnaires on behaviours, quality of life, process monitoring and cost analysis are being deployed. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval for this study was given by the King Fahad Medical City Institutional Review Board in the Saudi Ministry of Health (22-083E/March 2022). The data analysis has been approved by the University of Glasgow Medical Veterinary and Life Sciences Research Ethical Committee (200220194/March 2023).

c48e3c67e27e9dec5983b954fd29b4473f7e4b5e,Abstract A098: Lung cancer disparities among African Americans and other low-income communities in South Florida,"
 Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death in the US, accounting for about 1 in 5 of all cancer deaths. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. The American Cancer Society estimates that in the US, in 2024, there will be about 234,580 new cases of lung cancer (116,310 in men and 118,270 in women). It estimates there will be around 125,070 deaths from lung cancer (65,790 in men and 59,280 in women). Though these deaths can mainly be attributed to smoking, environmental factors have also had adverse effects on human health and lung cancer. We see an example of this in Florida with agricultural burning, specifically sugarcane burning. Sugarcane is one of the most important cash crops for Florida, around 10% of sugar produced in the United States comes from Florida. However, despite the economic importance of this crop, its harvesting process is controversial creating air pollution that is having adverse health effects on the surrounding communities. This review will discuss the impact of sugarcane burning on African Americans and other low-income communities, and how it’s exacerbating health issues, specifically lung cancer. As well as suggest better alternatives to sugarcane harvesting.

This study aimed to identify predictors of colectomy in patients with ASUC. Design This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources PubMed and Web of Science were searched up to April 2024. Eligibility criteria Studies on the predictors of colectomy in adult patients with ASUC were eligible. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers independently extracted the data using a prespecified data collection sheet. A qualitative synthesis was performed in tabular form. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted using OR and 95% CI. Results Forty-two studies were included in the systematic review. The reported variables can be categorised into biomarkers, auxiliary examination findings, demographic and clinical characteristics, and drug factors. Through meta-analysis, albumin (OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.59) per 1 g/dL increment, I2=0.0%), high C reactive protein level (2.63 (1.53 to 4.52), I2=29.6%), high erythrocyte sedimentation rate level (2.92 (1.39 to 6.14), I2=0.0%), low haemoglobin level (2.08 (1.07 to 4.07), I2=56.4%), fulfilling the Oxford criteria (4.42 (2.85 to 6.84), I2=0.0%), extensive colitis (1.85 (1.24 to 2.78), I2=47.5%), previous steroids (1.75 (1.23 to 2.50), I2=17.7%) or azathioprine (2.25 (1.28 to 3.96), I2=0.0%) use, and sarcopenia (1.90 (1.04 to 3.45), I2=0.0%) were identified as valuable predictors for colectomy within 1 year.

We aimed to summarize prevalences of mental disorders in Global South populations (classified according to the United Nations Human Development Index) affected by natural hazards. Methods To identify eligible studies for this meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science up to February 13, 2024, for observational studies with a cross-sectional or longitudinal design that reported on at least 100 adult survivors of natural hazards in a Global South population and assessed mental disorders with a validated instrument at least 1 month after onset of the hazard. Main outcomes were the short- and long-term prevalence estimates of mental disorders. The project was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023396622). Results We included 77 reports of 75 cross-sectional studies (six included a non-exposed control group) comprising 82,400 individuals. We found high prevalence estimates for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the general population (26.0% [95% CI 18.5–36.3]; I2 = 99.0%) and depression (21.7% [95% CI 10.5–39.6]; I2 = 99.2%) during the first year following the event, with similar prevalences observed thereafter (i.e., 26.0% and 23.4%, respectively). Results were similar for regions with vs. without recent armed conflict. In displaced samples, the estimated prevalence for PTSD was 46.5% (95% CI 39.0–54.2; k = 6; I2 = 93.3). We furthermore found higher symptom severity in exposed, versus unexposed, individuals. Data on other disorders were scarce, apart from short-term prevalence estimates of generalised anxiety disorder (15.9% [95% CI 4.7–42.0]; I2 = 99.4). Conclusions Global South populations exposed to natural hazards report a substantial burden of mental disease. These findings require further attention and action in terms of implementation of mental health policies and low-threshold interventions in the Global South in the aftermath of natural hazards. However, to accurately quantify the true extent of this public health challenge, we need more rigorous, well-designed epidemiological studies across diverse regions.

7ffc5f1047004ae2417575c13f03a9263f67b281,Exploring research trends and hotspots on oxidative stress and bronchopulmonary dysplasia: Insights from bibliometric and visualized study.,"BACKGROUND
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe chronic lung disease primarily affecting premature infants, often resulting from prolonged mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of BPD, contributing to lung injury, inflammation, and impaired lung development. Despite extensive research, there is a need to systematically map out the research trends and hotspots in this field to inform future studies and therapeutic strategies.


METHODS
This study utilized bibliometric and visualized analysis to explore global research trends and hotspots on oxidative stress and BPD from 2004 to 2024. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection, focusing on publications related to oxidative stress and BPD. Tools such as VOSviewer, Citespace, and the R package Bibliometrix were employed to analyze Coauthorship, co-citation, and keyword co-occurrence networks, as well as to identify emerging research fronts and influential studies.


RESULTS
The analysis identified 597 relevant publications, showing a steady increase in research output over the 20-year period, with a significant surge in the last decade. The United States led in research contributions, followed by China and Germany, with notable collaborations among these countries. Coauthorship analysis highlighted key research institutions, such as Harvard University and the University of California, as central nodes in the research network. Thematic clustering revealed five major research areas: antioxidant mechanisms, inflammation, molecular pathways, lung development, and therapeutic interventions. The keyword co-occurrence analysis showed a shift in research focus over time. Early studies concentrated on basic pathophysiological mechanisms, while recent research has increasingly focused on advanced molecular techniques, such as gene expression and targeted therapies. Notably, the study identified emerging research hotspots, including the role of extracellular vesicles and cellular senescence in BPD, as well as the potential therapeutic applications of antioxidants like superoxide dismutase mimetics.


CONCLUSION
This bibliometric study provides a comprehensive overview of the research landscape on oxidative stress and BPD, identifying key trends, influential authors, and emerging research topics. The findings underscore the importance of continued research in this field, particularly in translating basic scientific insights into clinical applications to improve outcomes for infants affected by BPD. The study also highlights potential areas for future investigation, including the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative stress in BPD.",Pediatric Pulmonology,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/ppul.27268?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.27268, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Despite its immense potential, the application of AI in museum research remains nascent (e.g., He et al. 2024), with some individual research groups pursuing independent projects without cohesive collaboration with AI experts who know or have experience in similar endeavours. Moreover, differing standards in utilising AI among researchers add complexity to the field. The NHM AI Lab Programme addresses these challenges by co-creating AI pilot projects that bring together the NHM's collection, academic researchers, and AI experts. 
 The NHM AI Lab Programme serves as a nexus for interdisciplinary collaboration, offering expertise in AI, machine learning, data science, and software engineering to support NHM researchers. Through one-to-one consultations and collaborative research projects, the NHM AI Lab Programme facilitates the integration of innovative AI-driven technologies into streamlining digitisation workflows and enhancing Earth and Life Science research at the NHM. 
 In less than a year since its inception, our Programme has achieved several milestones, hosting around 20 diverse projects. These include research projects such as the application of AI for the automatic detection and identification of nannofossils in chalk, the classification of ancient shark and dinosaur teeth, the prediction of mammal disease outbreaks, and the extraction of data from historical bird egg records. Additional projects focus on the automation of mineral analysis and the detection of secondary impact craters on planetary surfaces using AI. Some led to journal publications (e.g., He et al. 2024), while others streamlined NHM researchers' workflows, enhancing their processes of research and digitisation. Moreover, several initiatives have paved the way for new funding streams and collaborative ventures, as well as promising commercial prospects. Certain projects have pioneered the creation or transformation of datasets to meet AI-ready standards, such as data quality, consistency, accessibility, usability, and data governance protocols, helping to embed AI practices into NHM research. 
 This AI Lab Programme can act as a model for other institutions addressing a similar challenge of bridging the gap between AI and their research and collections.

This meta-analysis aimed to identify and quantify risk factors associated with sleep disorders in individuals experiencing chronic pain. 
Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted from January 2018 to June 2024. Studies assessing sleep disorders (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome) in adults with chronic pain (non-cancer pain lasting >3 months) were included. Data on demographics, pain characteristics, sleep measures, and potential risk factors were extracted. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Results: Twenty-seven studies (n = 12,453 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Chronic pain significantly increased the odds of having any sleep disorder (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.19-3.65). Specific risk factors identified included: Female gender: OR 1.41 (95% CI 1.18-1.67); Higher pain intensity: OR 1.15 per 1-unit increase on a 0-10 scale (95% CI 1.08-1.23); Longer pain duration: OR 1.04 per year (95% CI 1.01-1.07); Presence of depression or anxiety: OR 2.32 (95% CI 1.85-2.91); Use of opioid medications: OR 1.58 (95% CI 1.23-2.04).

We sought to investigate the mid-term and long-term efficacy of 1470 nm endovenous laser ablation (EVLA).


MATERIAL AND METHODS
We conducted a systematic research on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of science for articles published by January 2024. The primary endpoints were truncal vein and great saphenous vein (GSV) occlusion.


RESULTS
Fifteen studies, 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 5 prospective, and 6 retrospective case series, including 2064 patients and 2125 truncal veins (1862 GSV) were included. The pooled truncal vein occlusion estimates at 2, 3, and 5 years were 93.51% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.01, 95.84), 89.60% (95% CI: 82.75, 93.93), 88.94% (95% CI: 81.59, 93.58). The pooled GSV occlusion at 2, 3, and 5 years were 93.90% (95% CI: 90.30, 96.21), 93.01% (95% CI: 82.80, 97.36), and 89.06% (95% CI: 80.55, 94.12), respectively. The pooled deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and burn estimates were 1.42% (95% CI: 0.87, 2.31) and 2.64% (95% CI: 1.19, 5.75), respectively. The pooled overall and permanent neurologic complication estimates were 4.33% (95% CI: 1.62, 11.12) and 1.70% (95% CI: 0.69, 4.13), respectively. The pooled Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) reduction by the end of follow-up was, mean difference (MD), 4.96 (95% CI: 3.87, 6.05). Meta-regression analysis including linear endovenous energy density (LEED) values ranging from 69 to 101.7 J/cm elucidated a statistically significant positive association between LEED and GSV occlusion at the 2-year (β=0.0977, p=0.02), 3-year (β=0.2021, p<0.01) and 5-year (β=0.0534, p=0.01) follow-up intervals.


CONCLUSION
This review has displayed satisfactory medium and long-term truncal and GSV occlusion outcomes for the 1470 nm device. In addition, a positive association between GSV occlusion and LEED was identified, persisting through the 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year follow-up intervals. Despite these favorable findings further research is imperative, focusing not only on technical aspects, such as vein occlusion but also on critical clinical parameters, including varicose vein recurrence, to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and durability of EVLA.


CLINICAL IMPACT
This review demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the 1470 nm EVLA device in the treatment of lower limb venous insufficiency over the medium- and long-term periods, further substantiating its continued use. Moreover, the consistent positive association between linear endovenous energy density (LEED) and occlusion outcomes across the five-year follow-up interval highlighted the critical role of LEED in optimizing long-term clinical results, potentially offering valuable insights for practitioners.",Journal of Endovascular Therapy,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/15266028241305955?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/15266028241305955, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These organizational changes raise crucial questions about the employee’s future and well-being. Our study aims to explore the intersection between artificial intelligence and employee well-being through a bibliometric review and a contextual analysis. Methodology Carried out in May 2024, our study is divided into two phases. The first phase, dedicated to bibliometric review, was conducted using the PRISMA method, and explored the Scopus and Web of Science databases for the period from 2015 to 2024. A total of 92 articles were selected for quantitative analysis using VOSviewer software. The second phase is based on an in-depth systematic analysis of 25 articles selected from those previously identified. These articles were selected on the basis of their relevance to the research question, and were subjected to in-depth thematic analysis using NVivo software. Results The bibliometric analysis results reveal a significant increase in publications starting from the year 2020, highlighting advancements in research, primarily in the United States and China. The co-occurrence analysis identifies four main clusters: ethics, work autonomy, employee stress, and mental health, thus illustrating the dynamics created by artificial intelligence in the professional environment. Furthermore, the systematic analysis has brought to light theoretical gaps and under-explored areas, such as the need to conduct empirical studies in non-Western cultural contexts and among diverse target groups, including older adults, individuals of different sexes, people with low education levels, and participants from various sectors, including primary and secondary industries, small manufacturing businesses, call centers, as well as public and private healthcare sectors.

eca26fc99bba3813dc66915fc669ea86085e0709,The New EU Artificial Intelligence Act: Impact on the Biodiversity Information Community,"In February 2024, the European Union (EU) endorsed the AI Act, launched the new European Artificial Intelligence Office and initiated the program Generative AI for the EU (GenAI4EU, Fig. 1). This legislation governs how AI is developed, deployed and used in Europe. The obligations will incrementally become mandatory until 2030. While the Act was primarily designed to identify and protect humans from risks of manipulation and illicit use of AI, it will not be without impact on the biodiversity community. AI in our domain will mostly be ranked as no-to-low risk (Fig. 2). However, we will have to adhere to the transparency requirements and be particularly attentive when combining AI with citizen science initiatives affecting potentially the general public or for example, if projects concern illegal trafficking of species and border control. A further point of attention with our worldwide scope, is that non-European AI initiatives or tools allowed to be deployed or used in Europe will have to commit to follow both the AI Act and the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and have a reference person or institution with a legal address in Europe. There will be a two-year transition period as of 2026 to adapt to this regulation. 
 EU proposals require filling out an extensive questionnaire as an annex on ethical aspects, which already included the trustworthy usage of AI. This questionnaire is regularly updated, increasing the number of questions and details related to AI following the new EU AI act regulations. While the usage of AI is already evaluated, if present during the review process of proposals selected for funding by the EU, future projects can be audited at any time during their execution period, challenging compliance with both legal and ethical requirements of AI, risking being put on hold or even stopped if they do not comply. The Belgian Association of Research Managers and Administrators of European-funded projects (Be-Arma) provided an online training on compliance with AI & ethics in Horizon Europe.
 Current discussions at the EU level are on how they can remain competitive in AI, compared to other countries where fewer legal or ethical barriers exist. While judged essential, there are no doubts that such regulations slow down the development and implementation processes, as largely addressed during the conference, Research to Reality: Digital Solutions to European Challenges, held during the Belgian EU Presidency. The balance between open collaboration and free sharing of data and knowledge are challenged by concerns about so called strategic autonomy (European Commission et al. 2024) and competitiveness. These concepts were pushed even further in the EU conference: Research Infrastructures in a Changing Global, Environmental and Socio-economical Context, where the current critical geo-political context was linked to a need for even more strategic autonomy in Europe, where AI and other digital solutions were explicitly mentioned. 
 As an introduction to this session, this talk will go to the best of our knowledge over these new EU AI Act requirements and how it may affect future AI-linked activities in our natural sciences domain, including how they may affect the funding of our information technology activities.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.135924', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.135924?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.135924, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b5b0547cb320010088447f043ebfffe61d56ea97,Editorial,"In this June 2024 issue of the Science Education International, we are proud to present an array of scholarly articles that highlight the diverse and innovative approaches to science education from ten different countries: Türkiye, Greece, Estonia, Latvia, Philippines, USA, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, and China. This collection underscores the global commitment to enhancing science education through varied methodologies, cultural contexts, and unique challenges. Some of these articles were presented at the 7th ICASE World Science and Technology Education Conference, held in Dubai between March 27 and 30, 2024, further enriching the discussions with insights shared among global experts. The first article is from Türkiye. The article mentions that the rise in STEM education has led to more authors promoting Arduino in STEM. While research exists on Arduino and STEM separately, more studies on their relationship are needed. This study uses software tools (Vosviewer, Biblioshiny) and bibliometric methods, analyzing documents from Scopus (2013-2022). Performance analysis showed publication and citation trends, highlighting top contributors. Bibliographic mapping revealed conceptual, intellectual, and social structures. Results indicated prolific authors and institutes in Türkiye, with the most cited from the USA. Türkiye may soon lead due to high growth rates and younger documents. The study warns of potential monopolization and highlights the need for increased researcher mobility and collaboration. Overall, Arduino shows great promise in future STEM activities. The second article is from Greece. The article surveys primary students in Greece on their views toward STEM education based on urban or rural settings and gender. The sample included 281 students from Attica and 69 from a Greek province. Data was collected via a close-ended digital questionnaire. Most students felt good at math and science but unlikely to pursue related careers. They reported strong communication and cooperation skills. Rural students showed more confidence in improving their math and science skills, the usefulness of STEM knowledge, and awareness of environmental issues. Boys showed slightly more interest in STEM careers. The study suggests further research on geographical, gender, and socioeconomic disparities in STEM education. The third article, a case study from Estonia, aimed to enhance pre-service science teachers’ readiness for integration, inquiry-based learning (IBL), ICT use, and real-life applications in teacher training. It explored their perceptions of these methods and how their views evolved over time. A questionnaire was administered to 50 pre-service science teachers before and after their 2-year training, with data analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings showed that teachers studying multiple science subjects valued integration, IBL, ICT use, and real-life examples more, with significant perception changes over time. Nearly half did not see IBL as crucial, and only a quarter recognized the importance of ICT. The fourth article is from Latvia. The article addresses that teacher competence management and development are now school responsibilities, but school leaders often lack the tools and experience. Competence management in schools can involve identifying and implementing professional development (PD) tailored to teachers' needs. Unlike the ""one size fits all"" approach, personalized PD can be more effective. This study focuses on identifying science teacher profiles to improve teaching that promotes student conceptual understanding (CU). Using a mixed-method approach, the performance of 26 urban science teachers was observed and analyzed. The study identified six distinct teacher profiles, demonstrating varied PD needs and offering a methodology for using lesson observation data to create teacher profiles in small samples. The fifth article is the second article from Greece. The study examines 12th-grade students' understanding of ""orbital"" and ""electron cloud"" concepts in quantum contexts (n=1 and n=2) through verbal and pictorial representations. It involved 192 students from six urban schools in Northern Greece using a paper-and-pencil assessment. Results show students struggle more with verbal explanations than pictorial ones and exhibit inconsistencies between these representations. They understand the electron cloud better verbally, but the orbital better pictorially. Representations for n=2 are more challenging than for n=1. Students were categorized into four classes based on their profiles, with implications for science education discussed. The sixth article is written by researchers from the Philippines and the USA. This meta-analysis study (2017-2021) assessed the impact of Socio-Scientific Issues (SSI)-based approaches on learners' conceptual understanding, environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior. Analyzing various SSI techniques, the findings revealed a strong positive influence on understanding complex environmental issues and promoting sustainable behavior. The study noted that SSI fosters critical thinking and engagement but also identified potential publication biases. It emphasized the need for context-specific strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration in climate change education. Overall, the SSI approach helps develop proactive, environmentally conscious citizens capable of addressing global issues. The seventh article is from USA. The study investigated the impact of an active project-based, aquaculture constructivist-learning program on high school students' perceptions. It aimed to determine if the program influenced students' interest, engagement, and future educational and career aspirations in STEM fields, both inside and outside the classroom. The study also sought to understand students' knowledge about aquaculture and skill development post-program participation. Qualitative data were gathered through post-student focus groups, teacher journal reflections, and public newspaper articles from three rural high schools in Kentucky. Four main themes emerged: (1) students demonstrated excitement and enthusiasm in the hands-on aquaculture program; (2) students exhibited attention to detail in aquaculture tasks, leading to increased responsibility; (3) students engaged collaboratively with their peers; and (4) there was a greater interest and confidence in STEM through practical application. The results indicated that the program engaged learners in real-world problem-solving and decision-making situations, fostering collaboration and enhancing skills such as responsibility and self-confidence in STEM. The eighth article is from Thailand. This research assessed the ability of Thai grade 10 students to construct scientific explanations and explored differences based on learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. The study involved 231 students from Phetchaburi province, Thailand, with 77.5% demonstrating moderate ability levels. Significant differences were found in students' ability levels based on their learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. The study also revealed correlations between students' ability levels and their learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. Students with higher learning achievement, positive attitudes, and attendance at larger schools tended to have higher ability levels. However, there was no significant relationship between students' attitudes toward science and school size. These findings emphasize the importance of considering individual differences and backgrounds, particularly in terms of learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size, when teaching science. The ninth article is from United Arab Emirates (UAE). This mixed-approach study explores the effects of virtual science laboratories on students' motivation and attitude toward science. Conducted in an American curriculum private school in Dubai, the research surveyed 237 students from grades 7 to 11. Results show that virtual laboratories positively impact students' overall motivation, including intrinsic motivation, perceived usefulness, effort, perceived self-efficacy, and attitude toward science. Perceived self-efficacy and perceived usefulness significantly influence students' attitudes toward science, with perceived self-efficacy being a predictor of their effort. The tenth article is from South Africa. This study examines the effectiveness of Khan Academy Videos (KAVs) in rural thermodynamics education. 88 students were divided into two groups: one taught traditionally (control group [CG]) and the other using KAVs (experimental group [EG]). Results show significant improvement in learning outcomes and engagement with KAVs, with EG scores increasing by 61% compared to 31% in the CG. Pre-tests and post-tests were used to measure academic performance, and a mixed-method approach analyzed results and feedback. The study highlights the positive impact of KAV integration on student performance, especially in resource-limited rural schools, suggesting its transformative potential in enhancing teaching quality. The eleventh article is from China. The article analyzes 30 documents from Web of Science and CNKI databases to compare and understand the role of science teachers in China and overseas. The research highlights slow development in both Chinese and English publications, with most studies in theoretical exploration. The role of science teachers encompasses five main aspects: Role expectation, role orientation, role identification, role transformation, and role enactment. Combining the ""should be"" research from Chinese publications with the ""real"" research from English publications could lead to a more comprehensive understanding and positive interaction. This analysis provides a basis for future research on the role of science teachers.

Results: A total of 2,230 studies published between 1980 and 2024 were analyzed. The author with the most publications is Deliens, L, with 86 studies. The majority of studies were published in the USA, Netherlands, and Canada (692, 336, 225 respectively). The most frequently used keywords are euthanasia, palliative care, and ethics. The highest number of publications (149) was in the year 2021. In the strategic diagram for the first period (between 1980 and 2001), the themes of care and ethics were prominent, while for the second period (between 2002 and 2024), the clusters of nurse and shared decision-making were notable. 
Conclusion: After its legalization in the Netherlands, euthanasia has been accepted and implemented in some countries over the years, with variations in scope. Some countries, like the Netherlands and Belgium, also accept health problems related to old age and mental illness as euthanasia requests. The discussion around euthanasia often revolves around the principles of medical ethics, including autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Studies have focused on the role of physicians and nurses in the process, as well as end-of-life decision-making by patients. Recently, Canada defined the role of nurses in the euthanasia process, marking a significant development.",Family Practice and Palliative Care,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22391/fppc.1532764?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22391/fppc.1532764, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b84e0dc590b64f104f35bb3e11bb4dce407beb49,Perspectives on Academic Freedom in the Context of Transformation (insights Ukraine and Germany),"The article examines the current state of academic freedom in Ukraine and Germany in the context of their historical, social, and political challenges. Particular attention is paid to the impact of the Soviet legacy, bureaucracy, financial constraints, and the full-scale war in Ukraine on the functioning of educational and scientific institutions. The key aspects that define academic freedom are analyzed, including institutional autonomy, freedom of teaching, research, democratization of university culture, and international cooperation. The scientific novelty of the paper lies in identifying the interrelationships between the challenges of the post-Soviet legacy, structural barriers, the impact of war, and the prospects for international integration to strengthen academic freedom. The authors rely on the results of a thematic analysis of the discussion panel “Perspectives on Academic Freedom” held within the framework of the international conference “Open Science and Innovation in Ukraine 2024” (OSICU2024) and the German Year of Science 2024 - Academic Freedom initiative. The article identifies eight key thematic categories: academic freedom and autonomy, post-Soviet challenges, freedom of speech and censorship, funding and resource allocation, structural barriers, the impact of war on the academic environment, cultural and democratic development, and international cooperation. In each of these areas, the main challenges faced by Ukrainian and German universities are revealed and ways to address them are suggested. Considerable attention is paid to the issues of financial autonomy, which is the basis for the realization of academic freedom. The article discusses the need to increase basic state funding in Ukraine and to reform grant mechanisms in Germany. It is pointed out that international cooperation can play a crucial role in overcoming the challenges of war, involving Ukrainian scientists in the global academic community, and implementing best practices in university management. In addition, the study emphasizes the importance of developing democratic approaches to university governance and fostering a culture of openness and critical thinking. The results of the study offer recommendations for strengthening institutional autonomy, reducing bureaucracy, increasing the financial sustainability of universities, and ensuring academic freedom in the face of global and local challenges.

35800e3b32151199292bef3cb8257aca4d020e90,Antioxidant Therapies in the Treatment of Aminoglycoside-Induced Ototoxicity: A Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE
A feared complication of aminoglycoside treatment is ototoxicity, which is theorized to be attributed to the production of aminoglycoside-induced reactive oxygen species. Previous studies using animal models have suggested that numerous therapies targeting reducing oxidative stress may prevent ototoxicity from aminoglycosides. However, few clinical studies have been conducted on these antioxidants. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the effectiveness of antioxidant therapies in the treatment of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity.


DATA SOURCES
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov.


REVIEW METHOD
A literature search was conducted in August 2024. This review sought randomized controlled trials to be conducted on humans to examining otologic outcomes in aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity following administration of medications intended to reduce oxidative stress.


RESULTS
A systematic review yielded 2037 results, of which seven studies met inclusion criteria. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was investigated in four studies, aspirin in two studies, and vitamin E in one study. Six studies examined the benefit of antioxidant treatments for up to 8 weeks after administration while one study tested subjects' hearing after 1 year. In pooled analysis, two studies assessing NAC showed the greatest reduction in ototoxicity (RR 0.112, 95% CI, 0.032-0.395; p = 0.0007; I2 = 18%), followed by two studies examining aspirin (RR 0.229, 95% CI, 0.080-0.650; p = 0.0057; I2 = 0%). One study performed with vitamin E did not find a reduction in ototoxicity compared to the placebo (RR 0.841, 95% CI, 0.153-4.617; p = 0.8416).


CONCLUSIONS
Multiple studies have shown that NAC and aspirin are effective in reducing ototoxicity from treatment with aminoglycosides. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence. Additional studies should examine whether aspirin and N-acetylcysteine provide long-term benefit, and which of the other promising antioxidants translate from animal models.

Results show that scientific articles about global North countries and populations are systematically less likely to mention the country name in their titles compared to global South. For example, compared to the US, articles about China are between 1.8 and 2.7 times more likely to include the country name in the title. Significant variations across subdisciplines are observed, with Psychology displaying the lowest localization rates and greatest geographical gaps, and History showing seemingly converging trends over time across geographies.

 Introduction: p53 expression is associated with treatment failure and poor prognosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a novel regulator of p53 activity and is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. BTK inhibitors have shown high efficacy in mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocyte leukemia with p53 alterations, and refractory and relapsed DLBCL. This study explored the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, combined with R-CHOP (ZR-CHOP) in patients of newly diagnosed DLBCL with p53 over-expression.
 Methods: Newly diagnosed DLBCL patients with positive p53 protein expression (immunohistochemistry staining ≥50% of cells) were enrolled at the Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, from April 2022 to July 2024. ZR-CHOP regimen (zanubrutinib: 160 mg, bid, D1-21; rituximab: 375 mg/m², D1; cyclophosphamide: 750 mg/m², D2; doxorubicin: 50 mg/m², D2; vincristine: 1.4 mg/m², D2; prednisone: 100 mg/d, D2-D6) was administrated every 21 days for a total 6 cycles. Efficacy was evaluated using PET-CT/enhanced CT per Lugano 2014 criteria. The primary endpoint was the complete response rate (CRR), and secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related adverse events (AEs).
 Results: A total of 16 patients were enrolled in the study until July 2024. The median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range 34-67), with 7 patients (43.7%) in Ann Arbor stage III-IV, 2 patients (12.5%) with an ECOG score ≥2, 8 patients (50.0%) with IPI score ≥2, and 5 patients (31.3%) with extranodal involvement. There were 13 cases (81.3%) of double expression of MYC and BCL2, and 15 cases (93.8%) of the non-GCB subtype. By the end of the follow-up period in July 2024, 14 patients were evaluable for efficacy, with an ORR of 100%. 12 patients (85.7%) achieved CR, and 2 patients (14.3%) achieved partial response (PR). With a median follow-up of 11.8 (0.5-20) months, the 1-year PFS and OS rates were 93.8% and 100%, respectively. In terms of safety, common grade 3-4 adverse events included anemia (4 cases), leukopenia (5 cases), neutropenia (4 cases), thrombocytopenia (1 case), and pulmonary infection (2 cases). There were no new safety signals observed.
 Conclusions: The ZR-CHOP regimen is highly effective and safe for p53 over-expressed newly diagnosed DLBCL. It shows promise in improving the outcomes of p53-positive DLBCL patients.

To gain an understanding of the nuances of this concept, it is enough to delve into just one topic of elementary school mathematics curriculum. Select an arbitrarily unit segment, build two segments with lengths of ordinary fractions with different denominators and make sure that it is impossible to compare them in length in numerical terms. Then, appreciate the remarkable ability of Mathematics, to provide a solution to what would otherwise appear to be an insoluble problem. 

In the educational process, it is essential to differentiate between the state and the student. The first provides the opportunity to obtain knowledge, but is not to answer for the second. However, there must be moral and material motivation to obtain high-quality knowledge. In his teachings, wise Abay cautioned that the word from the educated though demanding, can illuminate the path to understanding. He urged to perceive the light and mystery that surrounds us. With his words ""Aitshy-aytshyp zhalynar, Uqqysh zhansyp shabynar. Uqpay zhatyp zhalyǵar, uıqyly-oıaý boıkúıez"", which translates as ‘mindless boredom, drowsiness’, he emphasised the importance of remaining alert and awake to the world around us. In the absence of boredom, sleepiness"", as in the case of personal transformation of the individual and the principle of ""you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink"". 

The concept of ""Justice"" is a multifaceted topic in the International Educational Space. It is the universal division between ""Global North"" and the ""Global South"", where the former has a stronger economy, infrastructure and technology, while the latter is characterized by less diverse economy, by poverty and inequality and a history of colonization by the countries of the Global North. These studies adopt from various points of views: sociological, economic, pedagogical, legal and political, as well as various professional approaches such as ""Fair education from the standpoint of textbook quality"" or ""Development and implementation of programs that take into account the needs of different groups of students"", ""Evaluation of the effectiveness of pedagogical strategies aimed at eliminating educational inequality"", and ""The role of technology in providing access to education"", etc.

234c6570d059ed72ee4a1224159fb22153bbbb61,Time to transfer: Long-term effects of a sustained and spiraled content literacy intervention in the elementary grades.,"We investigated the effectiveness of a sustained and spiraled content literacy intervention that emphasizes building domain and topic knowledge schemas and vocabulary for elementary-grade students. The model of reading engagement intervention underscores thematic lessons that provide an intellectual structure for helping students connect new learning to a general schema in Grade 1 (animal survival), Grade 2 (scientific investigation of past events like dinosaur mass extinctions), and Grade 3 (scientific investigation of living systems). A total of 30 elementary schools (N = 2,870 students) were randomized to a treatment or control condition. In the treatment condition (i.e., full spiral curriculum), students participated in content literacy lessons from Grades 1 to 3 during the school year and wide reading of thematically related informational texts in the summer following Grades 1 and 2. In the control condition (i.e., partial spiral curriculum), students participated in lessons in only Grade 3. The Grade 3 lessons for both conditions were implemented online during the COVID-19 pandemic school year. Results reveal that treatment students outperformed control students on science vocabulary knowledge across all three grades. Furthermore, intent-to-treat analyses revealed positive transfer effects on Grade 3 science reading (ES = .14), domain-general reading comprehension (ES = .11), and mathematics achievement (ES = .12). Treatment impacts were sustained at 14-month follow-up on Grade 4 reading comprehension (ES = .12) and mathematics achievement (ES = .16). Findings indicate that a content literacy intervention that spirals topics and vocabulary across grades can improve students' long-term academic achievement outcomes.

b97178c233a82b9d578d2dead7159830839abac0,"Parental Role: Internalization of the Development of Independent, Disciplined, and Responsible Character Values for Children Aged 5-6 Years","Parents play a crucial role in shaping the character of their children, and the character of children is closely tied to the involvement of both parents. This study aims to examine how parents function as educators, motivators, role models, controllers, and providers (facilitators) in cultivating character values, discipline, and responsibility in children. The research was conducted using qualitative methods with a sequential and phenomenological approach. Photovoice, combined with thematic analysis, served as the type and source of data. Data collection involved interviews and observations, with six pairs of parents with 5-6-year-old children participating in the study. The analysis revealed that parents, through their various roles, internalize the development of independent, disciplined, and responsible character values in their children. The study concludes that children aged 5-6 exhibit character values learned through a process of observation and imitation. Future research is encouraged to utilize these findings as a reference for instilling character values in children.

fe5921a4330665e13e6e02b0943a9d776d12d928,Causal relationships in longitudinal observational data: An integrative modeling approach.,"Much research in psychology relies on data from observational studies that traditionally do not allow for causal interpretation. However, a range of approaches in statistics and computational sciences have been developed to infer causality from correlational data. Based on conceptual and theoretical considerations on the integration of interventional and time-restrainment notions of causality, we set out to design and empirically test a new approach to identify potential causal factors in longitudinal correlational data. A principled and representative set of simulations and an illustrative application to identify early-life determinants of cognitive development in a large cohort study are presented. The simulation results illustrate the potential but also the limitations for discovering causal factors in observational data. In the illustrative application, plausible candidates for early-life determinants of cognitive abilities in 5-year-old children were identified. Based on these results, we discuss the possibilities of using exploratory causal discovery in psychological research but also highlight its limits and potential misuses and misinterpretations.

This disease is still spreading in Algeria, killing around 15 humans and more than 380 dogs per year despite the panel of applied measures that have been put in place over multiple years. Overall, a medium level of knowledge was obtained among the 409 surveyed students, with low levels reported among certain categories, including students studying in other fields than medical sciences, and there were some gaps of knowledge in terms of disease transmission, symptoms and risk factors. Regarding their attitudes, if an overall positive attitude was reported, some negative attitudes were also observed, especially the belief in the necessity of killing dogs who bite someone regardless of their vaccine status (59.2%). The importance of bite-wound washing is still ignored by most students. These results suggest the need to increase the level of knowledge of the Algerian students, and the public in general, in regard to this deadly disease through awareness campaigns. Abstract (1) Background: Rabies is a neglected zoonosis considered to be one of the most significant health threats in the world, responsible of thousands of deaths globally. Algeria is one of the main countries of concern, with more than 15 deaths and more than 100,000 bites by rabid-suspected animals being reported annually. This study was conducted to evaluate the level of knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP) toward this disease among university students in the endemic region of Algeria. (2) Methods: a cross-sectional online survey was conducted between June 2023 and March 2024 using a self administered questionnaire. (3) Results: a total of 409 students completed the questionnaire. Overall, 91.2% of them were singles, 70.7% were females, and two-thirds (66%) were between their twenties and thirties in regard to age. The majority were studying for Bachelor’s degrees, and the most represented fields of study were Humanities (31.5%) and Natural and Life Sciences (29.1%).The findings revealed a moderate level of knowledge (63% of correct responses), a positive attitude, and appropriate practices. However, the surveyed students have certain gaps in their information regarding disease transmission, its risk factors, and its clinical signs. In addition, some of them have also shown some negative attitudes, including approving of the systematic killing of a dog who bites someone regardless of its vaccine status (59.2%), and inappropriate practices, especially in regard to unawareness of the importance of early washing of bite wounds, which was reported among 64.5% of the surveyed students. The study also revealed the association of health sciences education with knowledge (AOR: 2.723, CI 95%: 1.317–5.634), attitude (AOR: 2.306, CI 95%: 1.113–4.779) and practice (AOR: 3.560, CI 95%: 1.632–7.769), and the effect of the high level of knowledge on the attitude of surveyed students (AOR: 1.607, CI 95%: 1.052–2.456). (4) Conclusion: These results provide the first report regarding rabies KAP among Algerian university students.

944e2d5cf3f4e76969bd288035bfe494634185fa,Toward the Institutionalization of a One Health Agenda: What the World can Learn from Bangladesh,"
 In 2005 and 2007, prompted by Nipah and avian influenza outbreaks, respectively, faculties at Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (CVASU) in Bangladesh initiated a civil society network of researchers in animal and human health. This network led to the launch a year later of One Health Bangladesh (OHB), a platform with membership open to multi-disciplinary scientists, practitioners, and activists. Along with continued advocacy to advance One Health agenda, OHB partnered with government, UN agencies, and other stakeholders to develop, in 2012, a National One Health Strategic Framework and Action Plan. The National Plan was later endorsed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock (MoFL), and Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFC) followed by its implementation which introduced a three-tier multi-sectoral coordination mechanism including the establishment of a One Heath Secretariat in 2016. In 2017, an operational budget for the One Health Secretariat (OHS) was allocated by the MoHFW and three mid-level government officers from three government agencies, and the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Department of Livestock Services (DLS), and Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD) were seconded to the OHS to make the Secretariat functional. OHB and the OHS now work together to advance the institutionalization process and implement One Health activities including One Health capacity building, joint surveillance, outbreak investigation and intervention, advocacy in the form of arranging dialogs, seminars, workshops, and conferences, and promoting cross sectoral and transdisciplinary collaboration, networking, and partnership nationally and internationally.

The study sample consisted of 80 students from the College of Educational Sciences studying the Prophetic Biography and its teaching methods during the second semester of the academic year 2021-2022 at Al-Hussein Bin Talal University. The students were divided into two groups: the control group, consisting of 40 students, who learned using traditional methods, and the experimental group, also consisting of 40 students, who learned using the Hill Climbing strategy. The researchers prepared an achievement test to measure the academic achievement of the students in the topic of Prophetic Biography and its teaching methods. The results of the study showed statistically significant differences between the two study groups in the students' level of achievement, in favor of the experimental group that learned using the Hill Climbing strategy. The study recommends the necessity and importance of employing the Hill Climbing strategy in teaching other Islamic education subjects such as Jurisprudence and its teaching methods and Creed and its teaching methods. The study also recommends conducting comparative studies between the Hill Climbing strategy and other modern teaching strategies.

854eb8bfff1769a17a51c3a95289d54a611ca015,The Development and Implementation of a Competency-Focused Curriculum in Health and Exercise Sciences,"Historically, undergraduate programs in Health and Exercise Sciences (i.e. Kinesiology) are rooted in common areas such as physiology, anatomy, biomechanics, motor control, psychology, nutrition, and rehabilitation. A typical four-year program offers a general education across these areas often delivering a breadth of knowledge in many areas, albeit often lacking in transferable technical skill that relates to industry. With many graduates now pursuing advanced training in professional programs there is a need to develop more competency-focused curricula to better prepare students for entry into professional fields. Further, overburdened healthcare systems worldwide combined with an ageing population find themselves with a gap in service delivery, given the growing body of evidence supporting the benefits of high-quality exercise training in the prevention, treatment and management of chronic conditions. In 2018, following feedback from provincial ministries, the University Senate, faculty, students, and community partners, the School of Health and Exercise Sciences at the University of British Columbia Okanagan underwent a strategic review. This review led to the development of a professionally focused, competency-based program, now known as the Bachelor of Health and Exercise Sciences. Within this program are three concentrations geared towards developing knowledge and skills in differing areas dependent on student interest and desired career path: Kinesiology and Allied Health, Health Behaviour Change, and Clinical Exercise Physiology. The development of the revised curriculum involved crucial components such as defining new program and concentration level learning outcomes, competency profiles, definitions, progressions, and practical assessment strategies. Additionally, each concentration integrates a community practicum designed to enhance mastery of competencies within a professional setting. Establishing these practicums necessitates ongoing collaborative efforts with both existing and new community partners, the formulation of standards, and the implementation of a process to ensure students possess a baseline skill level before engaging with the community. A substantial challenge in the revised curriculum is the instruction of technical skills in a lab environment, as well as effective practical skill assessment that meets industry standards, for upwards of 200 students. To this end a great deal of planning was required from a resources standpoint, onboarding of new faculty with industry experience, as well as alignment with pre-existing certifying bodies including the American College of Sports Medicine, Exercise & Sport Science Australia, and the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology. Looking to the future we anticipate both challenges and opportunities as we continue to redefine professional competencies and remap them throughout the curriculum to enhance skill progression and ensure our graduates are fit for purpose. Further, we are excited to continue to work alongside provincial entities and existing certifying bodies as we look toward the professionalization of the field. Lastly, but up utmost importance, is the dissemination of our process to other organizations and institutions in hopes to build momentum in the quickly evolving academic and professional landscape of Health and Exercise Sciences.

4f15f8a7022962571bff04ea20269d5f642f7c8f,A structured curriculum supporting biomedical trainees’ transition into independent academic positions and early career success,"The United States government makes a substantial investment in biomedical training programs each year. However, for most trainees, these opportunities do not translate into career progression in academic research pathways. Only about one-fifth of postdoctoral fellows eventually secure a tenure-track faculty position, and even among these candidates, attrition is high. Although a number of factors govern career choices and career longevity, the transition from trainee to faculty is a challenging process and requires knowledge and skills that are not necessarily developed during a traditional university experience. Many postdoctoral fellows receive adequate training in research skills and scientific communication, but new faculty report not being sufficiently prepared for the job search process and for starting their labs. To address this critical training gap, the ITERT core (Interdisciplinary Translational Education and Research Training) and the Office of Postdoctoral Fellows at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center implemented a structured course for both postdoctoral fellows and senior PhD students to provide formalized training for successfully navigating academic positions in biomedical research. Here we report on the pilot Navigating Academic Careers course conducted in 2021–2022 for 30 PhD students and postdocs. The nine-module course was conducted over 13 weeks in 25.5 h instructional sessions. The key educational objectives included 1) navigating the job application and the interview/negotiation process, 2) hiring, leading, and mentoring lab personnel and program support staff, 3) project administration and financial stewardship, 4) managing time and work-life balance and 5) developing collaborations, branding, personalized niche, and networking. Survey-based analysis at the time of the course was used to capture the participants’ assessment of the course content, organization, and delivery, with a follow-up survey conducted approximately 2 years post-course (2024) to evaluate longer-term impacts of the training. Initial in-course assessment revealed that 89.9% of respondents found the scope and instructional content appropriate, and 91.1% found the course relevant and applicable to their career needs. Longer-term post-course evaluation indicated that 80% of respondents applied the learnings of the course, that 80% reported feeling more confident in navigating an academic job search, and that 66.6% continued to report agreement with the course preparing them for their current role/ongoing job search, with 46.7% already securing jobs in academic research, including as independent faculty. The outcomes of this pilot course suggest that integrating this into the broader postdoctoral training curriculum can enhance both the transition and early-career success of talented scientists-in-training into working professionals in biomedical careers, as faculty and science-trained staff.

Aug 14, 2024, was the day the World Health Organization (WHO) announced, mpox (previously known asmonkeypox) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC-2024).1 While mpox undoubtedlyremains a global public health problem, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as dengue, chikungunya,rabies, snake bite, and leishmaniasis, listed among the 20 NTDs by WHO, predominate in Pakistan. The fragilehealth system of Pakistan, overwhelmed for the past decades by infectious diseases such as tuberculosis andmalaria, further worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The synchronal rise of mpox, dengue, andchikungunya infections is posing increasing concerns for the population and healthcare system further straining the economy's capacity to respond effectively. 
Mpox is a zoonotic infection caused by the monkeypox virus (MPVX), an orthopoxvirus in the same genus as thevariola virus, which is the causative agent of smallpox and, vaccinia virus (the virus used in the smallpoxvaccine).1 Mpox has two clades, Clade I (Central Africa) and Clade II (West Africa). Clade I, which was recentlyreported from Sweden, is more contagious and has a higher fatality rate (10%), raising global health concerns.The figures show that the global mpox count in 2024 surpassed last year's with 15,600 cases and 537 deaths.1Integrated Disease Surveillance & Response (IDSR), NIH, Islamabad, Pakistan has recorded a total of 14 travelrelated cases including one death (co-infection of HIV). All confirmed cases in Pakistan have been identified asthe Clade IIb strain, and no evidence of local transmission has been documented. A worrying aspect of mpox isthat no antiviral treatment is currently available for mpox and the initial clinical trials of the antiviral'Tecovirimat' are not very promising against Clade Ib.1 Moreover, controlling mpox infections in the younger age groups is particularly challenging as vaccination is not recommended for individuals that are 15 and under. This poses a grace concern as mpox infection is known to cause higher mortality in children younger than 15 as was reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Pakistan currently doesn't have the availability of the mpoxvaccine, making it inaccessible for those in need. 
Another endemic NTD that accounts for a huge burden of disease in Pakistan is rabies. Human infections aremostly due to dog bites and cases are diagnosed on clinical grounds only. Pakistan ranks in the top five countries globally in rabies-related mortality, with an estimated 2700-5000 deaths attributed to rabies in Pakistan. 
Dengue fever is yet another daunting health threat in Pakistan. About half of the world's population is at risk ofdengue with an estimated 100–400 million infections annually.2 In 2024, dengue cases surged globally, with theWHO reporting over 7.6 million cases by April, including 3.4 million confirmed cases, 16,000 severe cases, andmore than 3,000 deaths. Re-infection with a different dengue serotype increases the risk of severe illness,adding to the complexity of the outbreak.2 Pakistan faces a critical public health emergency, with 2,800 newdengue cases reported in September 2024, mostly in Baluchistan. Since May 2024, Karachi has experienced asurge in mosquito-borne infections, including dengue and chikungunya. The situation is being exacerbated byinadequate sanitation, optimal monsoon weather for mosquito breeding, prolonged heat waves, inadequatevector control measures, as well as contributing factors such as climate change, increased vector abundance(primarily Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes), and population movements.2,3 Both diseases aretransmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, also vectors for Zika and yellow fever. Thankfully, despite the presence of thevector, Pakistan remains free of yellow fever and Zika cases. 
Strengthening surveillance systems and training healthcare workers to ensure timely identification and management of mpox and other NTDs are crucial. The interconnected efforts for healthy ecosystems andcommunities are essential for resilience in the face of environmental challenges. By actively addressing climatechange, we can enhance planetary health and ensure a sustainable future for all. Collaborative initiatives thatinvolve governments, communities, and individuals will be crucial in achieving these goals. Strong advocacyand resource mobilization at national and global levels are essential to secure funding for outbreakpreparedness, support the stockpiling of medical supplies, and reinforce public health measures. Amultisectoral approach is required to tackle the rise in mpox and NTDs which remains a persistent challenge not only for Pakistan but also for planetary health. Despite the grim circumstances, there are positivebreakthroughs, such as the recent success in eliminating trachoma, a long-standing NTD in Pakistan. This is apromising development for Pakistan, the 19th country to reach this milestone. The trachoma eliminationreflects the government's commitment, WHO's support, and the contributions of partners and communities.Eliminating one disease is an achievement that reinforces our optimism in working towards controlling NTDs inthe future for the well-being of our planet and all its inhabitants.

The study questionnaire was administered to a sample of 970 students (15±1,04 years) in the third year of middle school in the Provincial Directorate of the Ministry of Education in Taza (Morocco). The data collected are analyzed quantitatively. The results show that the LES school subject occupies an intermediate position in terms of importance and a late place in terms of preference compared to other school subjects. Furthermore, the gender difference in the importance of this school subject is not significant, whereas in terms of preference, the difference is significant in favor of females (p?0,05, negligible effect size). According to the grades obtained in LES, the differences are significant in terms of importance (p?0,05, small effect size) and preference (p?0,001, medium effect size) favoring the students with the highest grades in this school subject. To improve the status of LES, the study suggests showing students the importance of this school subject in their daily lives and their academic and career paths, reinforcing experiences that bring them more emotional gain, and adopting innovative and engaging approaches that facilitate their learning.

6b9ae86985ffeebaa8d95e2f4e5efc95385c4d84,PERIPHERAL BLOOD COUNT RECOVERY TIME COURSE DURING INDUCTION TREATMENT FOR ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA IN CHILDREN,"Background: In recent years, the survival rate of pediatric ALL patients has increased to almost 90%, particularly for individuals with favorable prognoses. This success is mostly attributable to the use of risk-adapted medication, enhanced supportive care, and adjustments to therapy based on each patient's unique pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenomics. This research investigates ALL patients' response to induction chemotherapy, focusing on changes in peripheral blood cell counts and hematological markers, to predict therapeutic outcomes and provide a practical prognostic parameter.
Methods: This study involved 100 under 15-year-old patients with newly diagnosed ALL treated in pediatric leukemia units at Kuwait Hospital, Sana'a. Blood markers were collected and analyzed using Epi Info statistical program version 6. The study followed the French, American, and British classifications of pediatric leukemia. Participants were informed of the study's goals and advantages, and their participation was optional.
Results: The majority of patients were aged 5-9 years, with a mean age of 6.9 years. Hemoglobin levels were measured before and after treatment, with the mean level being 8.8 mg/dL before and 10.8 mg/dL after treatment. Severe anemia was reported in 10% of patients before treatment and decreased to 2% after treatment. PCV levels were also measured before and after treatment, with the mean PCV level being below normal in 66% of patients before induction chemotherapy but improving to 20% after treatment. The mean RBC count before treatment was 2.9 cells × 106/μl, but improved to 3.8 cells × 106/μl after induction chemotherapy. The study found that over 50% of patients had iron deficiency anemia before and after induction chemotherapy, with a mean neutrophil percentage of 18.2%, lymphocyte percentage of 73.7%, monocyte percentage of 3.8%, and eosinophil percentage of 0.85%.
Conclusions: The study reveals that blood cell parameters replenish at different rates during induction chemotherapy, resulting in rapid platelet and slow neutrophil recovery. Changes in blood markers during induction may be prognostic.

The learner’s perception of the feedback they receive is extremely relevant to their learning progress, which must aim at providing qualified care for patients. Studies pertinent to the matter differ substantially with respect to methodology, population, context, and objective, which makes it even more difficult to achieve a clear understanding of the topic. A scoping review on this theme will unequivocally enhance and organize what is already known. Objective The aim of this study is to identify and map out data from studies that report surgical residents’ perception of the feedback received during their education. Methods The review will consider studies on the feedback perception of resident physicians of any surgical specialty and age group, attending any year of residency, regardless of the type of feedback given and the way the perceptions were measured. Primary studies published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese since 2017 will be considered. The search will be carried out in 6 databases and reference lists will also be searched for additional studies. Duplicates will be removed, and 2 independent reviewers will screen the selected studies’ titles, abstracts, and full texts. Data extraction will be performed through a tool developed by the researchers. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis (content analysis) will be used to analyze the data. A summary of the results will be presented in the form of diagrams, narratives, and tables. Results The findings of this scoping review were submitted to an indexed journal in July 2024, currently awaiting reviewer approval. The search was executed on March 15, 2024, and resulted in 588 articles. After the exclusion of the duplicate articles and those that did not meet the eligibility criteria as well as the inclusion of articles through a manual search, 13 articles were included in the review. Conclusions Conducting a scoping review is the best way to map what is known about a subject. By focusing on the feedback perception more than the feedback itself, the results of this study will surely contribute to gaining a deeper understanding of how to proceed to enhance internal feedback and surgical residents’ learning progress.

They cause several negative repercussions among which Urban Heat Island (UHI) is the most widely recorded occurrence. The population of Dhaka city has increased by 12.64 million from 2011 to 2021 and the temperature by 0.57ᵒ C in the recent decade. Therefore, the city is facing increased public health-related problems associated with high temperatures, outbreaks of diseases, and scarcity of safe drinking water. Considering these matters, this study explores the spatiotemporal changes in Land Surface Temperature (LST) over the last twenty years and the present condition of heat islands. The city was found 3.9 °C warmer than the surrounding rural areas in 2022. The results also show recurring fluctuations in temperature together with a positive change in temperature during the study period. A year of high temperatures follows a gradual decrease in temperatures in the next two years, and a year of low temperatures follows several gradual increases in temperature. It is expected from the result that the upcoming two years (2023 and 2024) will be warmer than the last three years. The findings may provide insight into how LST and UHI fluctuate and aid in developing strategies to lessen their negative consequences.

3155d79d876174abcc21c34f00a32d9264e4e87e,The neuroscience of human empathy for pleasure: protocol for a scoping review,"Objective The neuroscience of human empathy for pleasure and positive affect is an emergent, scarcely addressed topic. The main aim of this scoping review is to map the impact of this new research domain on the field of social and affective neuroscience. Introduction Most of the literature on empathy and affect sharing has hitherto focused on negative emotions, with a special focus on pain. However, understanding, sharing, and reacting to others’ pleasures is an evolutionarily and socially important function. Our scoping review addresses this gap in the literature and tries to unify the available information under the empathy for pleasure umbrella. Inclusion criteria This scoping review is intended to cover studies on empathy for positive emotions, pleasant sensory outcomes, and other rewards in healthy individuals and neurological/neuropsychiatric/neurodevelopmental disorders populations. Methods We will perform a systematic search in the Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) databases. Two authors will independently screen all titles, abstracts, and then full-text articles that meet the inclusion criteria. The year range of interest will be 2000–2022, and only journal articles published in English will be assessed. Data will be extracted and presented in tables and/or graphical representations to synthesize and describe the results. The extracted data will be reported in a comprehensive summary. Results The final manuscript is intended for submission to an indexed journal in late 2023/beginning 2024. Conclusions To our knowledge, the present scoping review will be the first to address the variety and heterogeneity of available evidence on human empathy for pleasure. We ultimately aim at perusing the growing literature on this far-reaching field of study and informing future research.

8fff867235e45132933b0484bff1387e3d5d73f2,The Culture of Research: A Systematic Scoping Review,"Introduction: Research culture is the core of many processes in science. It is a broad concept presumably entailing practices, traditions, norms, etc. that prevail among researchers and other stakeholders in the field. Its definition, architecture, and taxonomy are essential in generating and pursuing scientific policies at universities and countries. As there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on research culture, the present publication aspires to fill the existing gap in the knowledge. This review aims to define research culture and build an architecture of research culture based on the relevant literature indexed in the Scopus database. 
Method: The problem, concept, and context (PCC) framework was applied to establish an effective search strategy and word the research questions corresponding to the aim. Based on Arksey and O'Malley's methodology (2005) and PRISMA checklist (2020) for systematic reviews, the authors sorted out 56 relevant publications for systematic scoping review. In addition, a bibliometric analysis was applied to examine the field. 
Results: Using a bibliometric analysis, the 56 publications were distributed by year, country, most prolific authors, sources, research fields, affiliation, and type of publication. With the help of VOSviewer, the authors singled out four thematic clusters (research culture; medical and biomedical research, methodology and research ethics, and clinical studies and human experiments). After synthesizing the data extracted from the documents under review, research culture was defined; components of research culture were singled out and summed up; and a framework of research culture was made up. The authors analysed the review findings in contrast with other research, offering their own comprehensive definition of research culture, its taxonomy, and an architecture of research culture.  
Conclusion: The current review adds to the understanding of research culture, its gist, component classification. The limitation related to the period of review (2019-2024) may be overcome by further reviews of relevant publications from a historic perspective that would broaden perceptions of the origin of modern research culture and its negative aspects.",Journal of Language and Education,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://jle.hse.ru/article/download/21526/18635', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17323/jle.2024.21526?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17323/jle.2024.21526, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

64bcf33dd9198e8ceeb91beffc7f23f5e4f04c11,A systematic review of stereotactic radiosurgery for metastatic spinal sarcomas,"Purpose Sarcomas metastasizing to the spine are a rare entity. Ideally an En-bloc resection is necessary to achieve durable local control (LC) rates. However, anatomical constraints often limit the degree of tumor resection. Because of this, other therapeutic modalities either replacing or as an adjuvant to resection are necessary. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a reasonable candidate therapy. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature using the following databases: PubMed, Science Direct, and Cochrane library. We used a combination of the following terms connected by boolean operators: “Metastatic Sarcoma, Sarcoma of the Spine, Spine Sarcoma, Metastasis, stereotactic radiosurgery, SRS.” All retrospective and prospective cohorts, as well as randomized control trials reporting on patients with histopathologically confirmed metastatic sarcomas of the bony elements of the vertebrae, thecal sac, cord, or associated soft tissues of the spine were included. We excluded animal studies, case reports, case series, patients < 18 (pediatric cohorts), review articles and meta-analyses. No date filters were applied to our search. Results Our final analysis included 5 studies ranging from 2009 to 2024 reporting on 260 patients and 371 associated lesions. Leiomyosarcoma was the most frequently reported histologic subtype (60%). Most lesions were localized to the thoracic spine (48.6%). 75% of studies reported a median dose < 30 Gy, and achieved biologically equivalent doses (BEDs) ranging from < 50–100. Pooled 1-year median survival was 64.5% (IQR: 61.8–75.10). Pooled 1-year median LC was 86% (IQR: 79.4–88.5). Three of five studies (60%) for OS and 4/5 (80%) for LC had data availability suitable for meta-analysis. The 1-year OS and LC rates proportions across these studies were 67% (proportion = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.57–0.75, p = 0.07, I2 = 63%), and 84% (proportion = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78–0.89, p = 0.10, I2 = 52%) respectively. Median follow up across all studies was 18 months (IQR:12.7–31.3). Conclusions SRS is a reasonable alternative therapy in either the up front, salvage or adjuvant setting which can facilitate durable LC.

Collaboration between academia and industry allows students to address actual industry challenges through PBL. This platform provides students with genuine learning experiences and industry practices that inspire them throughout their studies. It is important to highlight that South African institutions previously struggled to engage industry partners for educational purposes.The current systematic literature review study wishes to investigate the importance of industry partnerships on PBL within engineering education to benefit both students and industry demands.The systematic literature review methodology seemed appropriate for the current study due to its nature of extensively reviewing credible electronic databases. The electronic databases opted for included IEEE Xplore, ERIC, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Elsevier, and Google Scholar. The keywords considered in this study included ""project-based learning,"" ""industry partnerships,"" and ""engineering education."" The inclusion and exclusion criteria focused on articles credible articles and peer-reviewed conference publications between 2010 and 2024.The industry partnership through PBL equips students with lifelong experiences coupled with problem-solving skills, critical thinking, teamwork, and professional competencies. Academics are also afforded opportunities for industry secondment where they spend some time in industry while being exposed to the latest technologies to enhance their teaching capabilities. The industry also grasps opportunities to co-own selected facilities by branding them.The findings of this systematic literature review highlight the importance of industry partnerships with institutions of higher learning through PBL initiatives. Students are also afforded opportunities to better understand the fundamentals of engineering principles in real life. The PBL platform allows students to do projects that bring real changes that they can see and feel.

c8de0041bb6485a5ff79f40dd164670c5efcb18e,NETWORK PERSPECTIVE: BENEFITS OF INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION,"In 2010 Freeman suggested that ""the globalization of scientific and engineering knowledge is the most potent aspect of modern globalization"". International research collaboration is an activity that is widely pushed globally, at the level of research institutes and universities. Academic world is increasingly interconnected, fostering such international partnerships that represents the globalization of science from the scientific collaboration perspective. These collaborations extend beyond sharing resources. Main goal of those activities is exchanging ideas, cultures, and visions to address complex global challenges. It is evident that from partnering with institutions and researchers worldwide, National Agricultural and Food Centre (NPPC) can be exposed to diverse pools of knowledge and expertise that significantly enhance the academic quality and reputation of our NPPC. This global exchange of ideas leads to more innovative, comprehensive, and impactful research outcomes. Additionally, as the institute's reputation improves, the research centre will attract more funding, students and talented researchers, achieve globalization, creating a cycle of excellence and improvement.
In conclusion, the importance and benefits of international co-research agreements are multiple and profound. Collaboration's activities are pivotal in enhancing academic quality, broadening research horizons, preparing young researcher for global challenges, addressing international issues and policy makers, and fostering cultural understanding and global networks.

Atteh reviewed the effects of fiber on nutrition and reproduction in pigs. Author concluded that the reduction of dietary fiber's hemicellulose in a sow's lactation diet can improve the low-birth-weight piglets' health, post-weaning performance and milk composition. While exogenous enzymes and the extrusion of fibrous feedstuffs enhanced nutrient digestibility and utilisation, other processing methods, including fermentation and extrusion, decreased the dietary fiber components and had a beneficial impact on the performance of the pigs. Agro-industrial residues have enormous potential to improve reproductive efficiency and serving as an economically viable dietary fiber feeding strategy in the pig industry.
Awodoyin et al. investigated the dietary supplementation of coffee arabica seed powder on performance and meat quality of broiler chicken. Authors ended up that low pathogenic gut microorganisms and total volatile nitrogen base coupled with high sensory acceptability of meat confirm the antioxidant potential of black coffee in broiler chicken diet.
Ngige et al. performed a study aimed at screening the internal and external bacteria found in farmed Nile tilapia and African Catfish. According to microbiological investigation, the presence of the microorganisms, some of which are pathogens (Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca) to humans, is an indication that undercooked fish may pose health risks to susceptible human and an impediment to the rapid intensification of aquaculture because of mortality of fingerings.
Busanello reviewed the most common traffic systems in barns for lactating dairy cows milked in automatic milking systems. The study describes the advantages and disadvantages of free, milk-first and feed-first traffic and the differences between forced and guided cow traffic designs. Some research data are also shown to emphasize the theoretical concepts included in this document. Author concluded that guided traffic designs emerge as the most efficient, milking more cows throughout the day while reducing the need to fetch cows and overall labour. When operating at full cow capacity, guided cow traffic designs are recommended.
Sudik conducted a study with the aim to determine the nutritional composition of roselle seed cake (Hibiscus sabdarica L.) and its effect on broiler chickens. Author concluded that roselle seed cake is rich in proteins and energy and it can be included up to 50 % in the diet of broilers without negative effects on growth rate and carcass performance.
Rajsky et al. described the flexible duodenal monocannula of the National Agricultural and Food Centre design for the determination of intestinal nutrient digestibility in cattle. The innovativeness of the technical design of the NPPC cannula lies in the fact that the cannula is made of one piece of a straight tube with an inner diameter of 22 mm. As a result, the life of cannulated animals can be extended without age limitation.

The study analyses the legal framework for the implementation of the decentralisation reform, the processes of management transfer from central to local authorities and the mechanisms for ensuring quality of vocational education and training (VET). The importance of the transfer of state-owned real estate of VET institutions from state to communal ownership is substantiated, as this will enable local authorities to fulfil the tasks set by the decentralisation reform, in particular to provide quality vocational education and prepare workers to meet the demands of the local labour market. An analysis of data from the automated system ""Legal Entities"" on the transfer of VET institutions and their integral property complexes from the operational management of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine to regional budgets, budgets of city territorial communities based in regional centres and the budget of Kyiv is conducted. It was noted that between 2017 and 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted a number of decisions to transfer 217 VET institutions and their property to the operational management of local authorities. However, as of 1 September 2024, according to the automated system ""Legal Entities"", only 52 such institutions have been transferred. The factors reducing the effectiveness of government decisions are outlined, including the full-scale war launched by the russian federation against Ukraine, delays in updating data on state real estate of VET institutions in the ""Legal Entities"" system, insufficient funding for the registration of ownership rights to state real estate, and the reluctance of local authorities to take over the management of VET institutions. Further research is planned on the transfer of VET institutions to communal ownership, with an expanded focus on pre-higher professional education institutions, which have begun to be transferred to communal ownership during the current year.",Educational Analytics of Ukraine,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.32987/2617-8532-2024-5-105-115', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32987/2617-8532-2024-5-105-115?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32987/2617-8532-2024-5-105-115, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, AI-supported digital microscopy could be especially advantageous in primary health care settings, since such methods could improve access to diagnostics via automation and lead to a decreased need for experts on site. To our knowledge, no scoping or systematic review had been published on the use of AI-supported digital microscopy within primary health care laboratories when this scoping review was initiated. A scoping review can guide future research by providing insights to help navigate the challenges of implementing these novel methods in primary health care laboratories. Objective The objective of this scoping review is to map peer-reviewed studies on AI-supported digital microscopy in primary health care laboratories to generate an overview of the subject. Methods A systematic search of the databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and IEEE will be conducted. Only peer-reviewed articles in English will be considered, and no limit on publication year will be applied. The concept inclusion criteria in the scoping review include studies that have applied AI-supported digital microscopy with the aim of achieving a diagnosis on the subject level. In addition, the studies must have been performed in the context of primary health care laboratories, as defined by the criteria of not having a pathologist on site and using simple sample preparations. The study selection and data extraction will be performed by 2 independent researchers, and in the case of disagreements, a third researcher will be involved. The results will be presented in a table developed by the researchers, including information on investigated diseases, sample collection, preparation and digitization, AI model used, and results. Furthermore, the results will be described narratively to provide an overview of the studies included. The proposed methodology is in accordance with the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. Results The scoping review was initiated in January 2023, and a protocol was published in the Open Science Framework in January 2024. The protocol was completed in March 2024, and the systematic search will be performed after the protocol has been peer reviewed. The scoping review is expected to be finalized by the end of 2024. Conclusions A systematic review of studies on AI-supported digital microscopy in primary health care laboratories is anticipated to identify the diseases where these novel methods could be advantageous, along with the shared challenges encountered and approaches taken to address them.

89015c095d2b203cc34d5e9aea3e96fdd85c93e7,Formation of Library Specialists’ Readiness to Inform Scientific Library Users with News,"In the conditions of active technological development of society and increasing number of academic open access resources (OARs) there is a need for new knowledge and skills of library specialists who are able to realize modern forms of library and information services for scientists and specialists, including news information on current issues. Such information allows to orientate in the increasing disparate streams of news reflecting the current state of a particular scientific direction. In order to implement news information, continuous improvement of professional competences of library professionals is an important task.The purpose of this study is to justify the development of mass open online courses (MOOCs), as well as programmes of additional professional education (APE) on the basis of determining the readiness of university graduates in the specialty 51.03.06 “Library and Information Activity” to implement the work on news information of library users (on the example of open science). To achieve the goal, we studied the competences of graduates required by the Federal State Educational Standard of Higher Education — Bachelor’s degree in the direction of training 51.03.06 “Library and Information Activity”. These competences are necessary for the implementation of the information system in the library, they include knowledge of selected issues, the ability to create information products and services with the help of information and communication technologies, as well as the skills of analytical and synthetic processing of information (ASPI).The research method was a survey “Competences of librarians in the conditions of open science development” among 4th year bachelors studying in Russian universities in the direction of training 51.03.06 “Library and Information Activity”. This survey was conducted in the period from 1 February to 1 April 2024. It was aimed at studying the general ideas of graduates: 1) about open science and open knowledge, the growing interest in which is caused by the emergence of international initiatives and requirements of publishers/grantors; 2) about a variety of OARs; 3) about some legal aspects in the field of open science; 4) about technologies for creating modern library and information products and services; 5) about the methods and tools of ASPI as necessary elements of effective news information in a scientific library. The results of the survey allowed to conclude that the respondents are partially ready to inform library users. The survey also ranked the highlighted gaps in knowledge of some theoretical and practical aspects of ASPI that are required to create modern library and information products.The survey became the basis for the development of the MOOC School of Future Librarian “Library for Open Science”. The course “Librarian-Bibliographer — Instructor of Open Science”, implemented on the Stepik open platform, and a similarly-named training programme at the State Public Scientific and Technical Library of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences have also been developed.

The article reveals the main stages of the formation of the Yaroslavl School of socio-political studies. The biographies of the founders of the
Faculty of Socio-Political Sciences of the Yaroslavl State University named
after P. G. Demidov, P. F. Yankevich and V. M. Melikhovsky are highlighted, and
the ways of reproduction of the Yaroslavl scientific school of socio-political
research are shown. A series of interviews conducted with graduates of the
faculty and representatives of the professional community provides a holistic
picture of the formation of a system of scientific continuity and traditions.
The relevance of the article is determined by the need to study scientific
schools and trends in modern Russia, to preserve and strengthen ties between scientists in order to exchange experience and knowledge, scientific
achievements in the field of social sciences. Expanding the boundaries of
humanitarian knowledge makes it possible to create a voluminous research
platform, increase the possibilities for deepening and clarifying the content
of concepts, and form a modern discourse on the new realities of the modern
world. In this regard, the university named after P. G. Demidov are an example
of 35 years of serving the cause of further development and promotion of humanitarian knowledge in social and political practice. The structure of the article includes an introduction, a review of scientific publications of scientists
of the faculty, methods for studying history, research activities of scientists of
the faculty, information about departments and professorial and pedagogical
composition, biographical data of founding scientists of the faculty, reviews
of graduates about the faculty and teachers. The introduction considers: the
relevance, purpose of the article, the history of creation — the appearance of
the Yaroslavl school of socio-political research, at the origins of which were
professors of historical, economic, sociological political sciences — creators
of departments, leaders of research teams. It is noted that the beginning of
the faculty falls on a difficult, ambiguous time for the social sciences, when
there is a reformatting of public consciousness into liberal values, a rejection of Marxist ideology. This threatened with a break in gradualism, the destruction of continuity. At the same time, it was a period of searching for
new methodological approaches, striving to comprehend new Russian and
world realities. Methods. The basis for the research activities of the faculty
was the scientific works of its founders: P. F. Yankevich, V. M. Melikhovsky, M. Y. Mizulin, G. M. Nazhmudinov, Y. A. Golovina, V. V. Tomashova and others.
Subsequently, these traditions were continued by their students I. F. Albegova, L. G. Titova, T. S. Akopova, O. V. Eparhina, S. A. Kudrina, G. A. Yankevich,
I. V. Razumov, I. G. Shatokhin, A. G. Shatokhin, I. G. Perelomova, E. V. Koldeeva, young teachers A. V. Sokolov, N. V. Krainova, A. A. Frolov, F. Y. Kushnarev,
T. R. Gainutdinov and many others. To recreate the picture of the scientific,
pedagogical life of the faculty, the authors tried to cover the entire period of
its functioning, from 1990 — the year the faculty was founded to the present, studying archival data, referring to the analysis of documents and statistics on the publication and research activities of the faculty for 2019—2024.
The article reflects materials of interviews with teachers and graduatesю.
Results and discussion. The article reflects the problems discussed by historians, philosophers, sociologists of the faculty, new tasks that scientists of
departments solve with an understanding of the need to further develop the
humanities in new conditions, search for new approaches, and create a new
methodology for a multifaceted science of society. It is emphasized that the
dialogues of scientists on the most acute modern problems were held at the
All-Russian and international conferences organized within the framework
of the FSPN. Conclusion. The authors emphasize that at present the faculty
represents a constantly updating organism based on the principles of continuity, scientific activity, renewal and promotion of innovations in scientific
and teaching activities.",SCIENCE SPACE,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33873/3034-4379.2024.1-2.274-293?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33873/3034-4379.2024.1-2.274-293, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Digital twins are widespread in engineering and aim to can help many kinds of organizations simulate real situations and their outcomes, ultimately allowing them to make better decisions. Digital twins combine cutting-edge modelling approaches with powers of supercomputers with data streams. These data resources, coming through the research infrastructures, depend on data standardization, efficient data models and workflows, and on FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) of these elements. Digital twin concepts have been applied to biodiversity data since 2022, most notably through the Biodiversity Digital Twin project. The outcomes of dynamic modeling based on the biodiversity data (which availability changes in volumes and quality) against the globally available changing environmental and human impact data are expected to form the basis for management of natural resources and aims to support biodiversity recovery. The BioDT consortium brings together a dynamic team of experts in biodiversity data and standards, high performance computing, and FAIR data to realize the first set of biodiversity Digital Twin prototypes.
 Biodiversity evidence generated, standardized and shared from collections, systematic and long term surveys, eDNA and metabaroding, citizen science and other communities representing a range of biodiversity evidence types, can to be applied in the dynamic and interactive modelling solutions, known as digital tiwins. The Biodiversity Digital Twin project (and the twin approach in general) offers advanced simulation and prediction models to tackle global biodiversity challenges. This project is designed to address biodiversity dynamics through a set of use cases, providing insights and tools for conservation and restoration efforts. The BioDT project has revealed similarities and differences of applying Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) thinking and principles of data standardization to the communities with different levels of familiarity with standards and FAIR principles.

022fbd280ee515118ea7c6f9b4271840dc1a3f05,Influence of regional and yearly weather patterns on multi-mycotoxin occurrence in Austrian wheat: a liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric and multivariate statistics approach.,"BACKGROUND
Mycotoxin surveys play an essential role in our food safety system. The obtained occurrence data form the basis for the assessment of the exposure of humans and animals to these toxic fungal secondary metabolites. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the gold standard for mycotoxin determination because it enables selective and sensitive multi-toxin analysis. Simultaneous determination of several hundreds of secondary fungal metabolites is feasible using this technique. In this study, we combined a targeted dilute-and-shoot LC-MS/MS-based multi-analyte approach with multivariate statistics for the analysis of Austrian wheat from two different years and different geographical origins.


RESULTS
We quantified 47 secondary fungal metabolites, including regulated emerging and masked mycotoxins. The resulting multi-mycotoxin occurrence data were further analyzed using both multivariate and univariate statistics. Principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) were employed to identify regional and yearly trends within the dataset and to quantify the variance in metabolite occurrence attributed to the different effects. In addition, secondary fungal metabolites significantly impacted by these factors were selected via ANOVA. Of the 47 secondary metabolites identified, 39 were affected by the year, region or a combined effect. Moreover, our findings show that 43 of the secondary fungal metabolites were significantly influenced by the weather conditions.


CONCLUSION
The results presented in this study underline the added value of combining targeted LC-MS/MS with multivariate statistics for monitoring a broad spectrum of secondary fungal metabolites in food crops. Through multivariate statistics, trends associated with the year or region can be readily studied. The approach presented could pave the way for a better understanding of the impact of climate change on plant pathogenic fungi and its implications for food safety. © 2024 The Author(s).

 HERBARIUM PLANT SPECIMENS AND THEIR HERBARIUM HOLDINGS 
 
 Natural history collections around the globe represent a dormant source of taxonomic and biogeographic information, as it is estimated that one to three billion specimens are included in such collections (Soberon 1999; Ariño 2010). In the case of botanical collections, the worldwide distribution of specimens across herbaria is often uneven and biased by colonialism, with most specimens housed in the global North, and in many cases resulting in a reverse latitudinal relationship between plant diversity present in nature and the location of the herbaria housing it (Park et al. 2023). As an example, Yong (2013) reviewed holdings of common and type specimens and concluded that the type specimens’ accumulation in China is less than the world average. The number of type specimens is an important reflection of botanical accumulation in a country, and the number of specimens and their origins are therefore very important in a globalized framework. Accordingly, efforts to catalogue and digitize collections, and to make them globally accessible, are important tasks for herbaria.
 
 HERBARIA IN JAPAN AND THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO (TI) HERBARIUM
 
 In Japan, 74 herbaria are registered in Index Herbariorum (Thiers 2024), accounting for more than 13 million plant specimens. Herbaria in Japan date from the 19th century, with the first herbarium founded in Japan being the University of Tokyo’s (TI) herbarium (Herbarium of the University of Tokyo 2021) established in 1877. The herbarium holds a collection of more than 1,800,000 specimens of vascular plants, corresponding to ca. 14% of the total botanical collection of Japan. Although there is no complete survey of the number of specimens in the collection, it is estimated that the TI herbarium holds 20,000 type specimens, corresponding to 1% of the total number in the collection. Within the type specimens, only a fraction of the collection is digitized and available online, including 3,793 type specimens of angiosperms (and 1,743+ type specimens from other groups newly photographed in the last year). Regarding the ferns and lycophytes, the TI herbarium holds 35 families, including more than 300,000 specimens, comprising 1068+ type specimens (with 321 confirmed holotypes, 127 isotypes, and 510 syntypes), which are now being databased.
 The TI herbarium fern and lycophyte type collection includes plants from Japan, and important collections from Korea, Manchuria, Taiwan, and many Southeast Asian countries. Collections from outside Japan were mainly gathered by Japanese botanists that were assigned to expeditions in those countries, as Japan’s national power increased rapidly after the Meiji restoration (1869–1889). For example, Takiya Kawakami, originally from the Hokkaido University, actively worked on collecting plants from Taiwan; Hiroshi Hara worked on the Himalayan flora; Takenoshin Nakai worked on the Korean flora and collected medicinal plants from Indonesia and Ceylon (Sri Lanka); and Bunzo Hayata made a huge contribution to Taiwan’s flora. The specimens collected hold not only information on the taxonomic diversity, but also reflect historic events between Japan and these adjacent countries, thus proper curation of these materials is of great importance. The TI herbarium also holds unique collections, including many fern specimens collected from Seram Island (Indonesia), South America’s Andes collections by Fumio Maekawa, and Brazil’s Amazon collections by Masayuki Takeuchi.
 
 THE HIDDEN POTENTIAL OF THE TI HERBARIUM AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
 
 The TI herbarium collection is an important resource of natural history information, but its potential is still hindered by its incomplete databasing. In the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database, the Tracheophyta data from Japan currently consists of 3,503,623 herbarium specimens (GBIF.org 2024). Most of the data is from the TNS herbarium (500,060 specimens, National Museum of Nature and Science 2024), Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History (318,574 specimens, Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History 2024) and Nagano Environmental Conservation Research Institute (170,889 specimens, Nagano Prefecture 2023). The University of Tokyo's TI herbarium data only contains 40,382 specimens, not including any ferns or lycophytes, restricting access to the collection for researchers abroad. The TI herbarium mission now is to properly catalogue and make that information available, especially to those based in regions from where the plants were originally collected. Since 1981, many scientists have contributed to the cataloguing of the type specimens in the TI herbarium, with some of this data made available online. However, it is estimated that this database covers less than 10% of the collection, and does yet not include the ferns or lycophytes. We see the development of an open-access database for the TI herbarium as of utmost importance, as the herbarium represents an important historical and biodiversity account for East Asia.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.138439', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.138439?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.138439, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0409f9514aa3f9dff23e66c33b73ba9ba537a9f1,Food Security Challenges Emanating from COVID-19,"Food security is a multidimensional notion and it can be achieved at individual, domestic, regional,countrywide and global levels. This is achieved when all individuals, at all times, have physical and economicaccess to adequate, safe, and nutritious food to fulfill their intake needs and food choices for an active andhealthy life. As a result of COVID-19, global activity has witnessed an exceptional decline. The physicaldistance, school closures, trade restrictions, and country lockdowns for controlling the COVID-19 pandemichave led to escalated nutritional challenges globally. Food insecurity is defined as the persistent concern aboutaccess to sufficient and affordable food at all times. Food insecurity causes stress in people. This review aimedto evaluate the extent of disruption and break in the chain of continuity of food security as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review perused peculiar causes of food insecurity in the context of the COVID-19 pandemicalong with measures to counter them for the attainment of sufficient food security. This review articlemethodology was inclusive of the utilization of three search engines. These included PubMed, Google as well asGoogle Scholar. The keywords included food security, food chain, challenges as well as COVID-19, and healthoutcomes. Articles were included based on being published from the year 2008-2023. Out of 66 articles, 50were included (75%). The food availability having deteriorated due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected foodsecurity globally leading to various adverse health outcomes. Also, this has added to the burden of hunger andmalnutrition across the globe. A special focus on agriculture can aid in dealing with the shortage of food. TheCOVID-19 pandemic has culminated in tremendous detrimental repercussions on food security. Food chainimprovement and efficiency can be of pivotal importance in connection with the food security challengeshaving ensued following the COVID-19 pandemic.

4c0ec10b3aa78796813faad9c93d0b826a9b4484,"The Dream of Mainstream in TDWG, GBIF and SPNHC","The Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG), the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) have been providing nuts and bolts to biodiversity research for decades. Standards service the research community while requiring significant research themselves. Annual conferences gather a rather persistent group of practitioners who showcase the workings and products of the community (Ung and Kampmeier 2022). Is this effort visible to, and recognisable by, potential stakeholders?
 One way to put our groups in perspective is to look at the mainstream scientific production using theirproducts. GBIF has long been keeping track of research using the records it mediates, as well as monitoring the literature citing GBIF itself. TDWG, on the other hand, while also keeping record of its history, does not have a similar mechanism—perhaps because TDWG’s (and SPNHC’s) usual outlets often may not be on a par with the preferred scientific venues: standard, peer-reviewed, indexed papers. Amazingly enough, a huge amount of work seems to be known only through conference abstracts, presentations and posters, which even though actually peer-reviewed, do not truly conform to the ""gold standard"" of scientific publications, and are often contemplated by many actors such as evaluation agencies as merely grey literature representing ""fringe"" research.
 I have attempted to measure how much “mainstreamliness” TDWG, SPNHC and GBIF carry, by looking at how frequently their outputs show up in indexed research along with their citation patterns, and comparing those of other examples both related or unrelated to the three organizations’ remits. 
 METHODS
 In 2024, I queried Web of Science (WoS), Scopus (SC), and Google Scholar (GS) repositories for papers according to each platform’s capabilities, separately targeting (whenever possible) titles, abstracts, keywords, main texts, and references cited (Table 1). 
 Queries were crafted to find output from four groups: one focal (TDWG, GBIF, SPNHC, and the Darwin Core standard, DwC), and three containing examples of related activity or concepts; specific, biodiversity-related research; and unrelated (“outgroup”) general research (Table 2). I kept a tally of hits and other data such as citation numbers, and downloaded (or mined in the case of GS) either the full list of references or a sample, depending on the platform’s limitation.
 Exported references were combined in a database, filtered, and quality-checked. Indexed citation levels were obtained from either complete sets, or 10,000-record samples. The mainstream share was calculated as the quotient between WoS hits and GS hits per query.
 I defined the relative balance, or leverage, of the community’s uptake as:
 leverage = (SCc - SChl) / max[SCcm SChl]
 where SCc is the number of citations reported by Scopus for the indexed hits, and SChl is the number of records found by querying the indexed references’ literature lists (which contain both indexed and non-indexed literature). The index is positive when fringe literature is cited preferentially by fringe literature, negative when fringe literature is disproportionately cited by indexed literature, and zero when there is no uptake selectivity.
 The overlooked (i.e., used but not properly cited) production was estimated from the ratio of papers found by querying titles, keywords and abstracts, and papers found by querying literature citations. Low numbers mean that most indexed papers using certain information get it mostly from other indexed papers and there is little uptake from non-mainstream sources.
 RESULTS
 Data were available for about 9 million (WoS), 16 million (SC), and 23 million (GS) records, of which about 100,000 were used as the analytical sample. 
 GS revealed a flow of focal scholarly products growing at different rates. Detected GBIF output grew exponentially, doubling every 2.9 years, while TDWG and SPNHC have remained approximately constant over the last decade at about 375 and 76 documents per year, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the fraction of indexed output is tiny: 0.5% for TDWG since 2000 (0.8% overall), 0.8%–1% for SPNHC, and 3.9%–3.4% for DwC. GBIF has a higher proportion at 4.9% (recent) and 8.2% (overall). Related products have a recent 5.6% indexed share (6.7% overall), but they are all in stark contrast to other research areas: 62.4% (61.2%) for general concepts, 34.0% (61.2%) for taxonomical terms, and 38.8% (31.6%) for the selected outgroups (Fig. 2).
 The leverage showed a marked difference between focal and related areas, and general areas. TDWG, SPNHC and taxonomical databases had strong indexed leverage: their documents were overly cited in indexed literature. GBIF and standards citations were biased otherwise, being preferentially cited in unindexed literature but less so than all of the comparison terms (except Bioinformatics, neutral) (Fig. 3).
 While almost one-fourth of Scopus-indexed TDWG literature came from conference papers, these tended to be cited in SC-indexed articles rather than other conference papers in a 1:4 ratio. GBIF or DwC showed a more similar distribution of main types (articles, book chapters, conference papers, reviews) between published documents and cited documents.
 A reasonable conclusion is that despite the low proportion of indexed publications by TDWG, SPNHC or GBIF, their products are indeed uptaken by indexed publications, and comparatively much more so than in other areas. Thus, the scientific or technical production by those organizations does have a recognizable impact and should safely be considered de facto part of the mainstream scientific endeavor.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139153', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.139153?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139153, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5b12e7f1ddae99cea3d810493544d33b112febc4,Exploring Health Educational Interventions for Children With Congenital Heart Disease: Scoping Review,"Background Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 40,000 births annually in the United States. Despite advances in medical care, CHD is often a chronic condition requiring continuous management and education. Effective care management depends on children’s understanding of their condition. This highlights the need for targeted health educational interventions to enhance health literacy among children with CHD. Objective This scoping review aims to map and explore existing health educational interventions for children with CHD. The review identifies the types of interventions, target populations, delivery methods, and assessed outcomes. The goal is to consolidate fragmented research, identify gaps, and establish future research agendas. Methods Comprehensive searches were conducted in February 2024 using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) framework across multiple databases: APA PsycINFO, MedlinePlus via Ovid, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and EBSCOhost (CINAHL Complete, CINAHL Ultimate, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and ERIC). The search covered health care, design, and human-computer interaction disciplines to capture the interdisciplinary nature of CHD health educational interventions. There was no predefined time limit due to the limited number of relevant studies. Eligible studies were in English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and focused on primary data about educational health interventions for children with CHD. We extracted and synthesized data using thematic analysis. Results The review identified 11 studies: 9 randomized controlled trials and 2 observational studies. These used 6 educational strategies: 3D patient-specific models (n=3), habit formation interventions (n=2), empowerment-based health education programs (n=2), rehabilitation interventions (n=2), web-based portals (n=1), and videotape presentations (n=1). Interventions ranged from brief outpatient sessions to 1.5-year programs, with follow-up from none to 24 months. Studies aimed to improve coping, self-management, and knowledge for children with CHD and their families. The most frequently used assessment method was the independent samples t test (n=4) for pre- and postassessments, and all 11 studies used questionnaires, 8 of which incorporated qualitative feedback. The target participants for these interventions were children aged 13 years and older (n=3), parents (n=2), and children of various ages and their parents (n=6). Outcomes included improved children’s health literacy, reduced parental burden, and increased health care provider efficiency. Conclusions This review underscores the critical need for tailored educational interventions for children with CHD. Current research mainly focuses on adolescents and relies heavily on parental involvement, possibly overlooking the specific needs of younger children younger than 13 years of age. It is essential to develop engaging, age-appropriate interventions that actively involve children with CHD in their health care journey. Effective health educational interventions are crucial in empowering these young patients and improving their long-term health outcomes.",JMIR Pediatrics and Parenting,2024.0,4,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11806270, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1a811a56c40b21ed01d21c1158cba22922c50efa,A meta-analysis on the lifetime and period prevalence of self-injury among adolescents with depression,"Background Adolescents are vulnerable to mental disorders due to physiological, psychosocial, and cognitive changes during this critical developmental stage. Depression, in particular, can lead to high-risk behaviors such as self-injury (SI) and suicide. This study aims to estimate the pooled prevalence of SI behaviors among adolescents with depression. Materials and methods We systematically searched databases including EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Sciences for relevant articles published on adolescents with depression from January 1, 2000, to January 1, 2024. The quality assessment of the studies was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) criteria. The global prevalence of SI was calculated based on a random effects model using Stata software version 17. Results Our analysis included 29 studies involving 12,934 adolescents. The lifetime prevalence of SI was 52% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 41–64), while the period prevalence was 57% (95% CI: 49–64). Notably, a significant relationship was observed between the prevalence of SI and the year of publication of articles (p = 0.002). Furthermore, publication bias was not significant for both lifetime prevalence (p = 0.281) and period prevalence (0.358). Conclusion The prevalence of self-injurious behaviors in adolescents with depression is alarmingly high, with more than half of adolescents having engaged in these high-risk behaviors during their lifetime or within the last year. Given the associated risk of suicide, it is crucial to identify individuals at risk and provide timely interventions.",Frontiers in Public Health,2024.0,2,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1434958', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11322151, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ABSTRACT 
The testing of this research is intended to analyze the influence of teaching video media taken from YouTube as a learning medium in the TKR class XI SMK (Vocational High School). To find out the effectiveness of learning media that can enable students to understand and understand the concepts of light vehicle engineering scientific material where in fact the science taught is about systems and mechanisms or objects that move in a closed machine, of course the logic Learning that only uses images and explanations will not be easily understood by students because such knowledge is not general knowledge that can be found in everyday life or it could be said that students still feel unfamiliar. The sample population chosen in this research was class XI TKR (Light Vehicle Engineering) at SMKN 1 Kediri for the 2023/2024 academic year. This research design uses a quantitative approach, a Pre-Experimental Design model in the form of One-Group Pretest-Posttest Design research. To test the hypothesis, namely by analyzing the results of the sample pretest and posttest scores. The hypothesis of this research is that the use of YouTube video media influences the learning outcomes of class XI TKR students by looking at the significant increase or real increase in student learning outcomes. The research results from analyzing the data that have been obtained show that there is a significant influence on student learning outcomes in the PMKR (Light Vehicle Engine Maintenance) Class XI TKR subject at SMKN 1 Kediri. This can be seen from the results of the Hypothesis Test which was carried out using SPSS (Statistical Program and Service Solution) v25. From this test, the Asymp.Sig (2-tailed) value obtained was 0.000 < 0.05, which means that Ho was rejected and Ha was accepted, or in other words, by using YouTube video media as a teaching medium, there was a real influence or difference on student learning outcomes. This is proven by the pretest and posttest results obtained during the research at SMKN 1 Kediri for the 2023-2024 academic year.

We estimate the total SARS-CoV-2 infections in Austria after the end of the pandemic (May 5, 2023, per WHO) up to May 2024 from wastewater data. Those estimates are used in an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate average national levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection protection (IP) and COVID-19 death protection (DP). Methods: We use a previously published model estimating total infections in Austria from wastewater data and extrapolate the approach up to May 2024. Utilizing those estimates in an ABM, we estimate daily national average IP and DP. These estimates are based on waning immunity estimates of previous literature and incorporate documented vaccinations. Findings: We estimate approximately 3.2 million infections between May 6, 2023, and May 23, 2024, with a total of 17.8 million infections following May 12, 2020. The ABM estimates that 95% of people in Austria were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least once. It also shows very high levels of national average DP a year after the end of the pandemic. National IP remained relatively low after the onset of Omicron.

Existing public health crisis communication strategies need to be updated. However, crisis communication experiences of governments and public health agencies worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been systematically compiled, necessitating updated crisis communication strategies. Objective This systematic review aims to collect and organize the crisis communication experiences of senders (ie, governments and public health agencies) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our focus is on exploring the difficulties that governments and public health agencies experienced, best practices in crisis communication by governments and public health agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic in times of infodemic, and challenges that should be overcome in future public health crises. Methods We plan to begin the literature search on May 1, 2024. We will search PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Communication Abstracts, and Web of Science. We will filter our database searches to search from the year 2020 and beyond. We will use a combination of keywords by referring to the SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, and Research type) tool to search the abstracts in databases. We intend to include qualitative studies on crisis communication by governments and public health agencies (eg, officials, staff, health professionals, and researchers) to the public. Quantitative data–based studies will be excluded. Only papers written in English will be included. Data on study characteristics, study aim, participant characteristics, methodology, theoretical framework, object of crisis communication, and key results will be extracted. The methodological quality of eligible studies will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for qualitative research. A total of 2 independent reviewers will share responsibility for screening publications, data extraction, and quality assessment. Disagreement will be resolved through discussion, and the third reviewer will be consulted, if necessary. The findings will be summarized in a table and a conceptual diagram and synthesized in a descriptive and narrative review. Results The results will be systematically integrated and presented in a way that corresponds to our research objectives and interests. We expect the results of this review to be submitted for publication by the end of 2024. Conclusions To our knowledge, this will be the first systematic review of the experiences of governments and public health agencies regarding their crisis communication to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review will contribute to the future improvement of the guidelines for crisis communication by governments and public health agencies to the public.

86475c7a1e6ece287e59bc0b7a7cd2b9c9f7c256,Abstract C176: Implementing HPV vaccination services in people living with HIV in Trinidad and Tobago: COVID-19 vaccination may have boosted HPV vaccination,"
 Background: Globally, Caribbean countries are among the most heavily burdened by both HIV and cervical cancer (CCA). People living with HIV (PLWH) are more susceptible and vulnerable to cancer due to their immune-compromised status. There is a pressing need for clinic-based CCA prevention in PLWH. Objective: A preliminary quality improvement evaluation of the vaccination program targeting PLWH in Trinidad and Tobago from October 2018 to May 2024. Methodology: The electronic health information system from a large clinic was used to abstract HPV vaccination data. No personal identifiers were collected from the system to protect the privacy of individuals and abide by Trinidad and Tobago’s data protection law. Evaluation of quality improvement of interventions approach was applied. Descriptive analyses were conducted using SPSS. Results: A total of 5,615 PLWH were eligible to participate in the HPV Vaccination clinic from October 2018 to May 2024. The average age was 39.6 (age range: 18- 51); 51.4% were women and 48.6% were men. Most (81.7%) PLWH reported their sexual orientation was heterosexual. Among our participants, 62.4% were Afro-Caribbean, 18.6% were Mixed, and 7.4% were East Indian/Indian. The majority of PLWH completed at least secondary education (69.8%). Half were single (50.5%), and 42.1% were employed/self-employed. Among these HPV vaccine-eligible persons, 1,157 patients (20.6%) received HPV vaccines. For those who had received vaccines, 254 patients (22.0%) were vaccinated with at least 1dose of the HPV vaccine, 301 (26.0%) were vaccinated up to dose 2 HPV vaccine, and 602 (52.0%) were vaccinated up to dose 3 HPV vaccine. Importantly, of those who received the HPV vaccine, the rate of uptake varied for each year. The uptake of HPV vaccine from January to May 2024 was 10.5% and in 2023 it was 18.5%. The highest uptake was in 2021 which was 22.4% followed by that in 2022 which was 20.3%. Between 2018 and 2020, the uptakes were 13.7% for 2020, 12.1% for 2019, and 5.3% for 2018. Discussion: Overall, the HPV vaccination rate for PLWH was relatively low; only 1 in 5 was vaccinated. Still, we saw an interesting trend with the highest vaccination uptake during the peak years of COVID-19 vaccinations. Hence, our data suggest that the COVID-19 vaccination program may have boosted HPV vaccination. Given our lessons learned, our goal is to seek funding for an implementation and dissemination science approach for adopting, implementing, and sustaining clinic-based HPV-related cancer prevention by bundling services such as Pap-Testing, PSA testing and/or co-vaccination (e.g., flu, shingles) to improve reach and uptake towards reducing cancer-related morbidity and mortality among PLWH.

32463af46730bab597ec3a3036fbc95e9d6ccea9,The The Relationship between the Media Agenda and the Public Agenda on the Electability of Presidential Candidates,"Facing the 2024 election, two big figures have emerged who have been nominated as Indonesian presidential candidates for the 202-2029 period, namely Anies Bawesdan from the Nasdem Party and Ganjar Pranowo from PDIP. These two figures then became targets of the media by sharing information and activities carried out. Every report in the mass media is essentially a construction of events by the mass media based on the reality that occurred. The ability to construct this discourse will have a major influence on the opinions, decision making and political attitudes of readers. By understanding the work of media reality construction, people will be wise and appropriate in utilizing any information from the mass media. Solopos.com's media agenda setting regarding the two presidential candidates Anies Bawesdan and Ganjar Pranowo certainly greatly influences the level of electability of readers, especially among FISH Univet Bantara students who were respondents to this research. This research aims to determine the influence of the Solopos.com media agenda setting on the electability level of students in the candidacy of Anies Bawesdan and Ganjar Pranowo in the 2024 election and to analyze the influence of the public agenda on the electability level of students in the candidacy of Anies Bawesdan and Ganjar Pranowo in the 2024 election. The method used is a quantitative research approach. Data collection techniques use questionnaires, observation, documentation. Data is measured using a Linkert scale with a range of 5 options. Statistical analysis uses multiple linear regression analysis techniques. The respondents of this research are students of the Communication Science Study Program, Even Semester, Academic Year 2022-2023. The research results show that there is a relationship between the Solopos.com media agenda and the public agenda regarding the electability of presidential candidates. The political situation leading up to the 2024 election is an important moment for the Solopos.com media which is directly or indirectly participating in branding candidates Anies Bawesdan and Ganjar Pranowo as presidential candidates.",Communicology: Jurnal Ilmu Komunikasi,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21009/comm.032.02?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21009/comm.032.02, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

aa90d99431f96b5f0b2c035fbb2c80496c2d46f2,Artificial Intelligence in the Legal Field: Law Students Perspective,"The Artificial Intelligence field, or AI, experienced a renaissance in the last few years across various fields such as law, medicine, and finance. While there are studies outlining the landscape of AI in the legal field as well as surveys of the current AI efforts of law firms, to our knowledge there has not been an investigation of the intersection of law students and AI. Such research is critical to help ensure current law students are positioned to fully exploit this technology as they embark on their legal careers but to also assist existing legal firms to better leverage their AI skillset both operationally and in helping to formulate future legal frameworks for regulating this technology across industries. The study presented in this paper addresses this gap. Through a survey conducted from July 22 to Aug 19, 2024, the study covers the law students background, AI usage, AI applications in the legal field, AI regulations and open-ended comments to share opinions. The results from this study show the uniqueness of law students as a distinct cohort. The results differ from the ones of established law firms especially in AI engagement - established legal professionals are more engaged than law students. Somewhat surprising, the law firm participants show higher enthusiasm about AI than this student cohort. Collaborations with Computer Science departments would further enhance the AI knowledge and experience of law students in AI technologies such as prompt engineering (zero and few shot), chain-of-thought prompting, and language model hallucination management. As future work, we would like to expand the study to include more variables and a larger cohort more evenly distributed across locales. In addition, it would be insightful to repeat the study with the current cohort in one year to track how the students viewpoints evolve.",arXiv.org,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09937, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

395d7ee1b96a240b42de2e4fe3784938b06287ed,Abstract B175: Addressing the urgent demand for clinical research professionals through a novel training initiative,"
 Training and retaining diverse, qualified clinical research professionals that reflect the demographics of the community is pivotal to design inclusive clinical protocols, recruit underrepresented populations, and increase generalizability of scientific advancements. The University of Chicago's Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) and the Professional Education (UCPE) office job market analysis found an urgent and growing—and chronically unmet—demand for clinical research professionals across the United States. Nearly 6,930 employers nationwide had active clinical trials job postings from May 2023-2024. Illinois is among the top ten states with unique clinical research job postings. Further, internal UChicago analysis revealed high turnover in entry-level clinical research positions, highlighting a competitive job market for qualified individuals. As 60% of all clinical research activities at UChicago are cancer-focused, the UCCCC pursued novel strategies to diversify, grow, and retain the clinical research workforce. The overarching goal is to optimize pathways from undergraduate programs to clinical research careers. City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) and the UCCCC’s Clinical Trials Support Office (CTSO), Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and Office of Education are collaborating on a three-module Cancer Clinical Research Professionals (CCRP) Program to create new pathways into clinical research careers. The yearlong CCRP Program provides hands-on training and development opportunities to community college students interested in biomedicine via a 6-week summer internship, monthly academic year engagements, and a semester-long apprenticeship. The program expands CCC’s capacity to combine classroom learning with practical experience and professional opportunities, which are critical components of students’ education. It promotes career awareness, specialized skill development, and employment in cancer clinical research among CCC students, a diverse and highly motivated talent pool. The internship attracted 49 applicants in its first year. Out of 22 qualified applicants, 6 interns were selected and will begin their training in June 2024. Detailed findings from the internship evaluation will be available in September 2024. We expect the CCRP Program to be most students’ first experience with clinical research careers, greatly expanding their access to opportunities. Our evaluation will present lessons learned during the first year of the CCRP and plans to modify program components. Findings will also inform related training initiatives such as developing an Associate Degree in Clinical Research. We are confident that our forthcoming data will be of interest to other cancer centers and academic medical centers working to enhance their cancer clinical research workforce, which is essential for inclusive research and cancer health equity.

IVDD is a leading cause of lower back pain, the prevalence of which increases with age. Recently, Sirtuins/SIRTs and their related activators have received attention for their activity in the treatment of IVDD. In this paper, a comprehensive systematic review of the literature on the role of SIRTs and their activators on IVDD in recent years is presented. The molecular pathways involved in the regulation of IVDD by SIRTs are summarized, and the effects of SIRTs on senescence, inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in myeloid cells are discussed with a view to suggesting possible solutions for the current treatment of IVDD. Purpose This paper focuses on the molecular mechanisms by which SIRTs and their activators act on IVDD. Methods A literature search was conducted in Pubmed and Web of Science databases over a 13-year period from 2011 to 2024 for the terms “SIRT”, “Sirtuin”, “IVDD”, “IDD”, “IVD”, “NP”, “Intervertebral disc degeneration”, “Intervertebral disc” and “Nucleus pulposus”. Results According to the results, SIRTs and a large number of activators showed positive effects against IVDD.SIRTs modulate autophagy, myeloid apoptosis, oxidative stress and extracellular matrix degradation. In addition, they attenuate inflammatory factor-induced disc damage and maintain homeostasis during disc degeneration. Several clinical studies have reported the protective effects of some SIRTs activators (e.g., resveratrol, melatonin, honokiol, and 1,4-dihydropyridine) against IVDD. Conclusion The fact that SIRTs and their activators play a hundred different roles in IVDD helps to better understand their potential to develop further treatments for IVDD.

12c73dd45e7d53e3bf7ea7b38e6085d5ab399d08,"Prevalence, predictors, and economic burden of mental health disorders among asylum seekers, refugees and migrants from African countries: A scoping review","Background Asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees from African countries may have significant health needs, resulting in economic implications for receiving countries around the world. The risk of mental illness is higher in these communities because of factors like violence, deprivation, and post-immigration challenges. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the literature to determine the prevalence, predictors, and economic impacts of mental health (MH) disorders among asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees from African countries. Design and methods In this scoping review, we followed the guidelines from PRISMA and CoCoPop. A modified version of the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) was used to assess study quality for cross-sectional studies, while an appraisal list was used for qualitative studies based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). Inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed articles published in English, and articles based on official reports from credible institutions and organizations. Among the exclusion criteria were publications that were not peer reviewed or had not been sourced by credible sources, publications that did not meet the study topic or language criteria, mixed populations (including Africans and non-Africans), and research abstracts, reviews, news articles, commentary on study protocols, case reports, letters, and guidelines. Data sources A systematic search was carried out in Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science and EBSCO, to identify relevant articles that were published between 1 January 2000 and 31 January 2024. Results A total of 38 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 22 from African countries and three qualitative studies. In terms of number of countries contributing, Uganda was the largest (n = 7), followed by Italy (n = 4). The most studied conditions, using multiple diagnostic tools, were Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD, n = 19) and depression (n = 17). These studies all revealed elevated rates of mental health disorders among these groups, and these were related to migration, refugee-related factors, and traumatic events. Most of these groups are dominated by young males. There is, however, a prominent presence of minors and women who have suffered a variety of forms of violence, in particular sexual violence. Furthermore, mental illnesses, such as PTSD and depression, are not only persistent, but can also be transmitted to children. In accordance with our inclusion criteria, our review found only one study that examined the economic impact of MH disorders in these groups, leaving a significant knowledge gap. According to this randomized controlled trial, intervention to reduce psychological impairment can help young people stay in school, improve their quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and earn an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $7260 for each QALY gained. Conclusion Asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees from African countries are likely to experience MH needs, according to this scoping review. As well as posing persistent challenges, these disorders can also be transmissible to offspring. In addition to longitudinal studies of these groups, economic impact studies of mental illnesses are necessary.",PLoS ONE,2024.0,3,"{'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305495&type=printable', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11195976, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

50c3a6dee793b5aa8867a0f2c0405083d4fc47f3,Bacteriophage therapy as an innovative strategy for the treatment of Periprosthetic Joint Infection: a systematic review,"Background Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) following hip and knee arthroplasty is a catastrophic complication in orthopaedic surgery. It has long been a key focus for orthopaedic surgeons in terms of prevention and management. With the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance in recent years, finding more targeted treatment methods has become an increasingly urgent issue. Bacteriophage Therapy (BT) has emerged as a promising adjunctive treatment for bone and joint infections in recent years. It not only effectively kills bacteria but also demonstrates significant anti-biofilm activity, garnering substantial clinical interest due to its demonstrated efficacy and relatively low incidence of adverse effects. Purpose This review aims to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of bacteriophage therapy in treating PJI following hip and knee arthroplasty, providing additional reference for its future clinical application. Methods Following predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, our team conducted a systematic literature search across seven databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, CNKI, and WanFang Database). The search was conducted up to May 2024 and included multiple clinical studies on the use of bacteriophage therapy for treating PJI after hip and knee arthroplasty to assess its efficacy and safety. Results This systematic review included 16 clinical studies after screening, consisting of 15 case reports and one prospective controlled clinical trial, involving a total of 42 patients with PJI treated with bacteriophage therapy. The average patient age was 62.86 years, and 43 joints were treated, with patients undergoing an average of 5.25 surgeries. The most common pathogen in these infections was Staphylococcus aureus, accounting for 18 cases. 33 patients received cocktail therapy, while nine were treated with a single bacteriophage preparation. Additionally, all patients underwent suppressive antibiotic therapy (SAT) postoperatively. All patients were followed up for an average of 13.55 months. There were two cases of recurrence, one of which resulted in amputation one year postoperatively. The remaining patients showed good recovery outcomes. Overall, the results from the included studies indicate that bacteriophage therapy effectively eradicates infectious strains in various cases of PJI, with minimal side effects, demonstrating promising clinical efficacy. Conclusion In the treatment of PJI following hip and knee arthroplasty, bacteriophages, whether used alone or in combination as cocktail therapy, have shown therapeutic potential. However, thorough preoperative evaluation is essential, and appropriate bacteriophage types and treatment regimens must be selected based on bacteriological evidence. Future large-scale, randomized controlled, and prospective trials are necessary to validate the efficacy and safety of this therapy.

Surgical removal of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has the potential to achieve a cure, although there is ongoing debate regarding the significance of removing mediastinal nodes and the optimal extent of lymph node excision. The purpose of this research is to assess the survival outcomes in patients diagnosed with stage I–IIIA NSCLC who received either complete mediastinal lymphadenectomy (CML) or selective mediastinal lymphadenectomy (SML). Methods and analysis The protocol follows the guidelines recommended in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols, and this meta-analysis will be conducted in accordance with the standard methodology recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidance. We will conduct a comprehensive search for randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies examining the effectiveness of CML compared with SML in patients with stage I–IIIA NSCLC. Two authors will perform a comprehensive search of the MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, WanFang, Sinomed, VIP and Web of Science databases. There will be no restrictions on language or publication date, and the search will be conducted on 10 April 2024, with ongoing searches for new research. Reference lists will also be checked and pertinent journals will be hand searched. The primary outcomes include overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), while the secondary outcomes consist of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year OS rates and 1-year, 3-year and 5-year DFS rates. Two independent reviewers will screen, extract data, assess quality and evaluate the potential for bias in the selected research, with a third acting as arbitrator.

0df0ea95f29141d52ee61ee741e26d821c664d57,Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Network Instrument: Measuring PQC Adoption Rates and Identifying Migration Pathways,"The problem of adopting quantum-resistant crypto-graphic network protocols or post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is critically important to democratizing quantum computing. The problem is urgent because practical quantum computers will break classical encryption in the next few decades. Past encrypted data has already been collected and can be de-crypted in the near future. The main challenges of adopting post-quantum cryptography lie in algorithmic complexity and hardware/software/network implementation. The grand question of how existing cyberinfrastructure will support post-quantum cryptography remains unanswered. This paper describes: i) the design of a novel Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) network instrument placed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a part of the FABRIC testbed; ii) the latest results on PQC adoption rate across a wide spectrum of network protocols (Secure Shell - SSH, Transport Layer Security - TLS, etc.); iii) the current state of PQC implementation in key scientific applications (e.g., OpenSSH or SciTokens); iv) the challenges of being quantum-resistant; and v) discussion of potential novel attacks. This is the first large-scale measurement of PQC adoption at national-scale supercomputing centers and FABRIC testbeds. Our results show that only OpenSSH and Google Chrome have successfully implemented PQC and achieved an initial adoption rate of 0.029 % (6,044 out of 20,556,816) for OpenSSH connections at NCSA coming from major Internet Service Providers or Autonomous Systems (ASes) such as OARNET, GTT, Google Fiber Webpass (U.S.) and Uppsala Lans Landsting (Sweden), with an overall increasing adoption rate year-over-year for 2023–2024.

beec34c1e98f613a2988ecd522f97c83ff500999,Examining Exams Using Rasch Models and Assessment of Measurement Invariance,"Many statisticians regularly teach large lecture courses on statistics, probability, or mathematics for students from other fields such as business and economics, social sciences and psychology, etc. The corresponding exams often use a multiple-choice or single-choice format and are typically evaluated and graded automatically, either by scanning printed exams or via online learning management systems. Although further examinations of these exams would be of interest, these are frequently not carried out. For example a measurement scale for the difficulty of the questions (or items) and the ability of the students (or subjects) could be established using psychometric item response theory (IRT) models. Moreover, based on such a model it could be assessed whether the exam is really fair for all participants or whether certain items are easier (or more difficult) for certain subgroups of students. Here, several recent methods for assessing measurement invariance and for detecting differential item functioning in the Rasch IRT model are discussed and applied to results from a first-year mathematics exam with single-choice items. Several categorical, ordered, and numeric covariates like gender, prior experience, and prior mathematics knowledge are available to form potential subgroups with differential item functioning. Specifically, all analyses are demonstrated with a hands-on R tutorial using the psycho* family of R packages (psychotools, psychotree, psychomix) which provide a unified approach to estimating, visualizing, testing, mixing, and partitioning a range of psychometric models.

53196757d1d9852d806edcaf29e9676cca0676ac,Current Challenges in Pancreas and Islet Transplantation: A Scoping Review,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune condition characterized by the destruction of pancreatic β-cells, necessitating insulin therapy to prevent life-threatening complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Despite advancements in glucose monitoring and pharmacological treatments, managing this disease remains challenging, often leading to long-term complications and psychological burdens, including diabetes distress. Advanced treatment options, such as whole-pancreas transplantation and islet transplantation, aim to restore insulin production and improve glucose control in selected patients with diabetes. The risk of transplant rejection necessitates immunosuppressive therapy, which increases susceptibility to infections and other adverse effects. Additionally, surgical complications, including infection and bleeding, are significant concerns, particularly for whole-pancreas transplantation. Recently, stem cell-derived therapies for type 1 diabetes have emerged as a promising alternative, offering potential solutions to overcome the limitations of formerly established transplantation methods. The purpose of this scoping review was to: (1) summarize the current evidence on achieved insulin independence following various transplantation methods of insulin-producing cells in patients with type 1 diabetes; (2) compare insulin independence rates among whole-pancreas transplantation, islet cell transplantation, and stem cell transplantation; and (3) identify limitations, challenges and potential future directions associated with these techniques. We systematically searched three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) from inception to November 2024, focusing on English-language, peer-reviewed clinical studies. The search terms used were ‘transplantation’ AND ‘type 1 diabetes’ AND ‘insulin independence’. Studies were included if they reported on achieved insulin independence, involved more than 10 patients with type 1 diabetes, and had a mean follow-up period of at least one year. Reviewers screened citations and extracted data on transplant type, study population size, follow-up duration, and insulin independence rates. We identified 1380 papers, and after removing duplicates, 705 papers remained for title and abstract screening. A total of 139 English-language papers were retrieved for full-text review, of which 48 studies were included in this review. The findings of this scoping review indicate a growing body of literature on transplantation therapy for type 1 diabetes. However, significant limitations and challenges, like insufficient rates of achieved insulin independence, risks related to immunosuppression, malignant diseases, and ethical issues remain with each of the established techniques, highlighting the need for innovative approaches such as stem cell-derived islet transplantation to promote β-cell regeneration and protection.",Biomedicines,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12122853', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11673013, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ee1f258b95381ce805241cec10f831f7312d0de3,"EXPLORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HAMBURGER AND MIND MAPPING GRAPHIC ORGANIZERS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION AT GULF COLLEGE, OMAN","Graphic organizers have become increasingly popular in tertiary education in the Sultanate of Oman in recent years, particularly in ESL and EFL reading-writing classes. These visually appealing tools are now widely recognized as an effective method for presenting knowledge, allowing learners to develop their understanding of the text with the guidance of the teacher. The incorporation of graphic organizers into English classes has been found to significantly improve students' reading and writing performance. The use of graphic organizers has transformed the learning experience, providing students with a structured and engaging platform to enhance their language abilities. Consequently, the use of graphic organizers as an instructional tool continues to flourish and have a positive impact on education in Oman, offering numerous opportunities for accelerated growth and enrichment in the field of language acquisition. Additionally, the implementation of graphic organizers has not only benefited students' linguistics skills but has also proved to be instrumental in developing critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. With their visually stimulating format, graphic organizers stimulate students' cognitive processes, prompting them to analyze and synthesize information more effectively. This not only improves their comprehension and retention but also equips them with valuable skills that are increasingly sought after in today's globalized and technologically driven society. Furthermore, the versatility of graphic organizers makes them adaptable to various subject areas and educational levels. Whether used in science, social studies, mathematics, or even creative writing courses, these tools have demonstrated their efficacy in facilitating knowledge acquisition and conceptual understanding. By visually organizing information, students are able to make connections between different concepts, identify key points, and extract crucial information in a more organized and systematic manner. The use of graphic organizers in tertiary education in Oman has revolutionized the way students learn and acquire knowledge. With their ability to enhance comprehension, foster critical thinking, promote collaboration, and adapt to various subject areas, these tools have proven to be an asset in empowering students and preparing them for success in higher education and beyond. The present study was conducted to recognize and determine the impact of hamburger and mind mapping graphic organizers utilization on undergraduates' English writing skills at Gulf College in Oman. It attempts to answer the following research questions: First, what are the effects of a hamburger graphic organizer used in paragraph writing? What are the effects of a mind-mapping graphic organizer used for the same purposes as a hamburger graphic organizer? To address this issue, a study has been conducted on the use of hamburgers and mind mapping organisers as tools for enhancing paragraph construction skills among undergraduate students at Gulf College. This study draws on a social constructionist theoretical framework and employs various research methods such as a systematic review of the literature, an in-depth semi-structured questionnaire to collect tutors’ perceptions and practices in using such graphic organisers, and an analysis of writing assignments of some Gulf College students in the academic year 2023/2024. Through this study, teachers expressed their concerns, perceptions, and teaching practices in terms of applying the hamburger and the mind-mapping graphic organisers to paragraph writing. The current study showed that students achieved greater success in the writing class when they passed through hamburger and mind mapping graphic organizers as the pre-writing stage of writing. They tend to have clearly stated topic sentences, main ideas, and supporting ideas in more coherent paragraphs.  Article visualizations:",European Journal of Foreign Language Teaching,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.46827/ejfl.v8i2.5512', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.46827/ejfl.v8i2.5512?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.46827/ejfl.v8i2.5512, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1bc2ce5bd94c7961ea1ca68973ed17b2ef3f8317,The Development of Early Childhood Naturalist Intelligence through Environmental Education,"Environmental education exists as a solution to improving the intelligence of early childhood naturalists, but its implementation is often forgotten or only as a hidden curriculum. The purpose of this study is to provide information related to the implementation of environmental education for early childhood to improve the intelligence of early childhood naturalists. The research method used in this study is a qualitative method presented in the form of an in-depth literature review. Literature study efforts are carried out by reading, observing, recognizing, and describing to analyze reading material in the form of related literature as a reference source. The result of this study is that the use of instructional strategies for gardening activities and creative game-based environmental learning can be considered to improve the intelligence of early childhood naturalists. In addition, it was also found that the material often used by educators to improve naturalist intelligence is the introduction of animals and plants. The trend of measuring the intelligence of early childhood naturalists uses many observation sheets, but it is also recommended to use research instruments that have been standardized or published in reputable scientific articles to obtain valid and reliable data.

0f3b5e87848040f4162f33518eefc040805b7ce1,A Comprehensive Approach to Graduate Education in the Biomedical Sciences,"There are roughly 130 biomedical sciences-related PhD training programs in the U.S. with about half of the graduates remaining in academia post-graduation. Biomedical sciences PhD programs emphasize rigorous training in research to prepare students to enter academia but may lack training in other areas that contribute to career success. Trainees face many challenges in graduate school, including meeting the basic scientific knowledge and research milestones, developing strong communication skills, and enriching their skillset through professional and career development opportunities to best position themselves for future success. To accomplish all of this while maintaining a healthy sense of self can be daunting. The Graduate School (TGS) at Augusta University (AU) aims to facilitate ground-breaking research alongside outstanding education by providing a holistic and comprehensive graduate experience. TGS is currently undergoing review and revision of three of the four arms of graduate education: academics, research, student well-being, and professional development. We use data collected from an external review and 52 currently enrolled and previously graduated (within 3 years) biomedical sciences PhD students to identify opportunities for improving the first-year core curriculum at AU. In response, TGS developed a first-year core curriculum committee tasked with reviewing, revising, and addressing gaps in the first-year core curriculum. Furthermore, TGS has developed and launched GradWell, a health and wellness initiative, and has also partnered with external collaborators to offer strategic professional development opportunities to biomedical sciences students, prioritizing holistic growth to enhance the student experience. Continuous programmatic evaluation related to curriculum, student well-being, and professional development is critical to ensure programs are meeting the evolving needs of students while incorporating innovative pedagogy to maximize training opportunities and the development of well-rounded research scientists.

fe2e5bc0457f962cfa0c34b7be714d3e19a8b37e,USE OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO HUMAN CYTOKINES IN DIAGNOSTIC AND ANALYTICAL STUDIES,"The use of human monoclonal antibodies in diagnostics and analytical studies is determined by the rapid development of technologies and approaches in the field of immunology and clinical laboratory diagnostics. Cytokines, as biologically active substances, play a key role in the regulation of immunity, inflammation and other physiological processes. The use of monoclonal antibodies to cytokines provides an opportunity to accurately determine their concentration and study the interaction with other molecules in clinical studies. The development of new diagnostic methods and analytical studies using monoclonal antibodies opened up prospects for increasing the accuracy and sensitivity of the determination of various diseases. This is especially important in the context of medicine, where accurate diagnosis becomes fundamental for choosing the optimal method. Aim. The purpose of this work was to analyze the possibilities and advantages of using monoclonal antibodies to human cytokines in diagnostics and analytical studies, in particular their use in immunological biosensors, for monitoring the immunological status of patients after organ transplantation and diagnosing oncological diseases. Methods. A comprehensive review of literature was conducted, encompassing multiple databases including Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and other relevant sources up to the year 2024. Keywords employed in the search included biosensors, cell markers, monoclonal antibodies, leukemia and Western blotting, transplantation. Results. The paper investigated the potential and advantages of using human monoclonal antibodies to cytokines in medical diagnostics and analytical research. Their application in biosensors for precise determination of cytokine concentrations, immunophenotyping of blood cells and tissues, diagnosing tumors of various histogenesis, treating leukemias and lymphomas, determining immunological status and composition of the immune system cells were analyzed. The methodology of comprehensive immunological examination after organ transplantation and treatment, including аcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), was also considered. Conclusions. Monoclonal antibodies, effective in biosensors, are used in various fields such as biological research, clinical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring. Their use has limitations, such as cost, complexity of acquisition, and potential loss of signal sensitivity. Immunophenotyping allows the identification of blood cells based on their markers, which is important for hematological diagnostics. Immunohistochemical tissue studies use monoclonal antibodies to verify tumors and detect infectious diseases. Diagnosis of leukemias and lymphomas using monoclonal antibodies helps to determine tumor type and optimal treatment. Western blotting is used to determine proteins in tissues or blood, including confirming diseases such as Lyme disease or Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV infection. Flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are also used in immunological laboratories for disease diagnosis and immune status assessment.",Biotechnologia Acta,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.15407/biotech17.04.024', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15407/biotech17.04.024?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15407/biotech17.04.024, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ab6c9723a280e1049180bc453014c3e2ce9d817b,Abstract LB143: Environmental assessment of alcohol-related policies and practices at US cancer organizations,"
 In 1998, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) declared that the consumption of alcoholic beverages was a class I carcinogen to humans; the designation was reaffirmed in 2007 and 2010. Despite this, approximately 4% of new cancer cases worldwide in 2020 were attributable to alcohol intake. Growing evidence indicates that alcohol use increases the risk of cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract (oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and larynx) and lower digestive tract (colon, rectum, and liver). Over half of the 6.3 million cases of these cancers are considered preventable, underscoring notable gaps regarding alcohol consumption and cancer prevention. Despite (1) the longstanding designation of alcohol as an established carcinogen, (2) an increasing and consistent body of data noting alcohol as a leading contributor to the global cancer burden, and (3) the publication of policy statements by authoritative sources, it is unclear whether cancer-focused institutions are aware of these facts or are acting on these data (i.e., implementing evidence-based policies and practices to limit alcohol-related cancer risks for their employees, guests, or the public). Driven by these data and shortfalls, we developed a 22-item survey to inquire about cancer organizations' interpretation of current literature, existing policies, decision-making processes, inclination to act, and perceived responsibility to lead in the realms of public education and policy implementation to mitigate alcohol-related cancer risks in the public’s interest. The survey will be sent to over 100 leading U.S. cancer organizations, including NCI-designated- and other major cancer centers, cancer-oriented professional organizations, and cancer-research organizations. It underwent rigorous testing for clarity, brevity, and expected response time, also drawing upon the expertise of five survey-science professionals. The study is under institutional review board (IRB) review, and we anticipate the survey’s distribution in the first quarter of the calendar year 2024. We expect to share the survey instrument and results during the meeting.

 Background: Despite efforts to integrate genetic cancer risk assessment (GCRA) services into mainstream medicine, the dearth of healthcare providers adequately trained in clinical cancer genetics remains a significant barrier to care, particularly in underserved communities. Since 2001, City of Hope has helped address this need through a distance mediated lntensive Course (IC) and Clinical Cancer Genomics Community of Practice (CCGCoP), with a focus on training and supporting clinicians who deliver care to underserved patient populations. Here we report on the reach, education, and practice outcomes from the past five annual cohorts of the IC in its pursuit to expand GCRA care to underserved areas and minority populations. Methods: Practice catchment area and patient population data were collected on the course application. Cancer genetics knowledge was assessed at baseline and immediate post-course; professional self-efficacy and practice changes were measured at baseline, immediate, and 12 months post-course. Results: Of 762 participants from five IC cohorts (2020-2024), 566 (74%) indicated they provide all or part of their care in an underserved area and/or to minority populations; 55 (10%) practice outside the U.S. Of these 566 clinicians, mean pre-to-post course knowledge scores increased 59%, and mean pre-to-post self-efficacy scores increased by 38%. Of 195 participants who completed a one-year post-course practice survey, 68 (35%) did not practice GCRA at baseline, of whom 61 (88%) reported implementing GCRA into their practice one-year post-course. Of 126 participants who were practicing GCRA at baseline, 55 (44%) reported an increase in their GCRA patient volume at one-year post-course. Open-ended feedback revealed that participants highly valued IC training and ongoing CCGCoP support for building and sustaining their GCRA skills, resources, and practices. Conclusions:Results demonstrate the efficacy of distance-mediated training and ongoing practice support in enhancing clinician competencies and knowledge of practicing GCRA therefore increasing access to GCRA services for underserved and minority patient populations. Efforts are underway to leverage the resources of the IC and CCGCoP to develop a more flexible, cost-effective course model and collaborate with champions to increase access to best practices in GCRA in diverse underserved settings across the US and internationally.

8c035a9b2b5a03c9c8fba640a3cf806447d260de,Does aortic valve anatomy affect the long-term outcomes of aortic root reimplantation? A retrospective study with propensity score matching,"Introduction: The results of aortic root reimplantation techniques in patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) are generally recognized. However, data on the results of valve-preserving operations in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) remain limited.Objective: In this retrospective study we compare the long-term results of reimplantation technique, depending on the type of aortic valve (AV): BAV versus TAV.Methods: The retrospective study included 224 patients (average age 48.43 ± 13.70 years, 81.2% men) who underwent valve-preserving operations by reimplantation of the aortic root from January 2013 to January 2023. Depending on the anatomical variant of the AV, the entire sample was divided into two groups: 76 patients with BAV (33.9%) and 148 patients with TAV (66.1%). To eliminate the systematic differences between the compared groups, the propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used in order to compare groups by 12 criteria. As a result, 33 pairs of patients were formed. After the PSM analysis, there were no significant differences between the groups.Results: In total, 221 (98.2%) patients were examined in the long-term period. The average follow-up period for the entire sample was 53.17 ± 26.34 months. After the PSM analysis, there were no significant differences between the groups in the number of patients examined, namely 33 individuals (100%) in each group. The average follow-up period was 55.24 ± 22.66 months. At long-term follow-up, 100% survival was recorded in both groups. Prior to the PSM analysis, the freedom from aortic insufficiency (AI) grade ≥ II in the patients with TAV was 90.2% and 88.2% at 5 and 10 year follow-up periods, and in patients with BAV this indicator was 89.6% and 89.6% (p = 0.786), respectively. After the PSM analysis, the freedom from AI grade ≥ II in the patients with TAV was 84.2% and 84.2% at 5 and 8 year follow-up periods, and in the group with BAV it was 85.1% and 85.1% (p = 1.000), respectively. Prior to the PSM analysis, freedom from aortic valve reoperation at 5 and 10 year follow-up periods in the patients with TAV was 99.3%, and in the patients with BAV it was 98.6% (p = 1.000). After the PSM analysis, this indicator at 5 and 8 year follow-up periods in the patients with TAV and with BAV was 100% and 96.7%, respectively (p = 1.000).Conclusion: The reimplantation technique enables to effectively reconstruct the aortic root regardless of the anatomical variant of the AV, providing excellent survival with a low risk of reoperation.

7bc191d361fd7f971652822e1a5f1cb51bd649df,MPharm students’ views and experiences of the teaching of pharmaceutical calculations and their importance in pharmacy practice,"
 
 
 Accurately undertaking pharmaceutical calculations is an important professional skill as part of a pharmacist’s role ensuring patient safety1. Effective teaching in this area supports safe, high-quality care from future pharmacists. In the United Kingdom, the need to accurately perform calculations is stipulated in the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) standards for initial education and training of pharmacists2. During a review of teaching in this area, the views and experiences of pharmacy students were sought, in order to inform course design.
 
 
 
 This project aimed to explore undergraduate MPharm students’ views regarding the importance of pharmaceutical calculations to their future careers, experiences of current calculations teaching, and opinions on improving course design.
 
 
 
 A questionnaire was developed and distributed to Years 1-4 pharmacy students (n=524) at the School of Pharmacy, Queen’s University Belfast (QUB), in December 2023. The questionnaire consisted of 45 questions, collecting demographic information, as well as students’ views and experiences of pharmaceutical calculations, various teaching methods, and student confidence with calculations. Data was transcribed into Microsoft Excel, followed by analysis using descriptive statistics in IBM SPSS. Ethical approval was received from the QUB Faculty of Medicine, Health & Life Sciences Research Ethics Committee (MHLS23_159).
 
 
 
 A total of 271 students responded to the questionnaire, providing a response rate of 52%.
 Students felt that being able to perform calculations is important to their future career, with 97% of respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing with this statement. Hospital pharmacy was considered the sector where calculations were most important (96% agree/ strongly agree). Overall, 75% of respondents agreed/ strongly agreed that they were confident in undertaking pharmaceutical calculations. Students felt most competent using provided formula, and with dose and dosage regimen calculations. Conversely, students felt least competent performing displacement value and dilutions questions.
 With respect to teaching design, students preferred blended-learning to self-directed study or traditional lectures. Eighty-seven percent of respondents reported blended-learning as beneficial/ very beneficial, compared to 57% and 46% for the other approaches.
 Students reported formative quizzes as the most beneficial activity for learning (92% beneficial/ very beneficial). This was followed by provision of worked examples, with a preference for handwritten solutions. Recommended textbooks and online discussion boards were considered least beneficial.
 Having dedicated introductory calculations teaching in Year 1, with repeated opportunities for practice and support in subsequent years had the most support for improving teaching, with 87% stating this would be beneficial/ very beneficial. There was also support for the NUMBAS3 e-assessment system for formative examples, along with video or pencasted worked examples, with 80% and 70% of respondents respectively classing these as beneficial/ very beneficial.
 
 
 
 QUB MPharm students appreciate the importance of pharmaceutical calculations to their future careers. They prefer a blended-learning approach to teaching, incorporating formative quizzes and worked examples.

This research brief presents findings from a six-year longitudinal study of CS enrollments in seven public high schools from the 2018-2019 through the 2023-2024 academic years, drawing on the administrative data of over 15,000 students. Results show that overall enrollment in CS courses rose modestly from 10% to 15% between the 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 school years. Enrollment declined to 13% in 2023-2024, though the cause and persistence of this trend remains unknown. Additional analyses differentiate foundational and advanced CS courses as well as examine participation by sex and race, offering additional insight. As CS, artificial intelligence, and related fields become more important across our society, they also become a key component of a robust K-12 education.

These discoveries range from methods of rapid detection of the virus, basic knowledge of the structure and function of viral proteins, mechanisms of cell penetration, receptors, interaction with the host, transport and genomic integration, stability, pathology, to the development of control procedures, especially antivirals. For years, HIV infection was synonymous with death, until the scientific community and the pharmaceutical sector developed antiretrovirals. There are currently multiple specific compounds directed against different stages in viral replication, such as reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nucleoside analogues and non-analogues, protease inhibitors, inhibitors of fusion and penetration of the virus, antagonists of co-receptors on the surface of lymphocytes, integrase blockers, inhibitors of the fusion of the virus to the cell membrane, capsid inhibitors, pharmacokinetic enhancers. These drugs are combined, using at least two drugs in a single pharmaceutical form with two different classes of action for oral treatment and also in long-acting intravenous administration.

2d32bf93c95e4ae2405768c6e8c6c42e25bdb084,2024: The Year of Completion of the National Project “Science” (“Science and Universities”),"In December 2024, the national project “Science and Universities” was completed. Its main achievements include the scientific equipment upgrade program. At the same time, the continuing negative trends noted in the Presidential Decree “On the Scientific and Technological Development Strategy of the Russian Federation” (No. 145 of February 28, 2024) are alarming. They include the concentration of science and technology potential in a limited number of regions of the country. Taking into account the demographic situation in Russia, the task of rejuvenation of research personnel adopted in the national project “Science and Universities”, which has been continued in the programs for the development of research organizations, set up by the end of 2024, will lead, in our opinion, to the strengthening of this negative trend. This is also facilitated by the logic of the development of modern science, which obeys the law formulated by V.V.Nalimov back in the 1960s: every 10 years the amount of scientific information doubles in the branches of natural sciences. The limited capacity of the human brain to process new information forces researchers to narrow the field of their scientific interests. But even here, the information flood, reinforced by the products of “paper factories” producing fake science, poses intractable problems of analyzing new achievements. The business of publishing services is already entering the automatic mode of production of pseudoscientific output, and as long as the evaluation of a researcher’s performance is determined by the number of articles, the negative trends noted by the President of Russia will only intensify.",Science Management: Theory and Practice,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.19181/smtp.2025.7.1.2', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.19181/smtp.2025.7.1.2?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.19181/smtp.2025.7.1.2, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Our aim was to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the literature focusing on masticatory performance. We conducted a survey in Web of Science up to August 31, 2024, applying specific category filters. Two calibrated reviewers manually tabulated the data, extracting information on title, authorship, keywords, institutions, countries, number of citations, year of publication, journal title, study design, masticatory test, population, and dentition status. VosViewer software generated collaborative network maps, while JAMOVI was used to perform ANOVA and Poisson regression analyses. The selection process resulted in 814 articles published between 1950 and 2024, with a recent increase to at least 50 articles per year. The average impact factor was 3.16, with around 30 citations per article. Citations were significantly influenced by the masticatory performance technique, publication year, and journal impact factor. The comminution test was the most prevalent (n = 411). Most studies focused on adults (n = 420) and older adults (n = 361), in which natural dentition (n = 404) and complete dentures (n = 214) were the most widely assessed parameters. The most frequent study designs were cross-sectional (n=489) and prospective (n = 145). The leading countries were Japan (n=202), Brazil (n=134), and the Netherlands (n = 69), and the Journal of Oral Rehabilitation was the most recurrent journal (n = 162).

44a798982b1d1de1471fc048e3a2447eeea93116,Student Attitudes During the Pilot of the Computer Science Frontiers Course,"Motivation. We have created a modular project-based learning curriculum, Computer Science Frontiers (CSF) [1, 8], for secondary students in attempts to increase the persistence of computer science (CS) students in higher education. The CSF course is divided into four different modules (Distributed Computing, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering), each centered around a topic typically introduced to students only in higher education. Using the block-based programming environment NetsBlox [4], students are able to access various Application Programming Interfaces related to their interests [2, 3]. The goal of this course is to increase student interest in CS during high school - when first career choices occur [7] - in hopes they will persist in CS during their undergraduate studies. Research question. The research question for this study was: How does the Computer Science Frontiers course affect student attitudes towards computer science? Research Methods. We conducted over 20 interviews with students throughout a CSF pilot course that took place over the 2022-2023 school year. Interviews were conducted with at least five students at the end of every module. Two researchers have conducted thematic analysis with student responses from the first two modules [5]: Distributed Computing (DC) and Internet of Things (IoT). First, the two researchers developed a norm by tagging one interview together [6]. Next, the researchers independently coded the rest of the interviews for each module. After completing a single module’s interviews, the researchers met to rectify any discrepancies. Finally, the tags were grouped together based on common themes. Through this process, we found a total of seven themes. Results. The themes found through thematic analysis include: computer science, attitudes towards course, student wants, student struggles, attitudes towards projects, collaboration, and student progression. As a result of this study, we have identified different needs for secondary students with varying background in CS when studying more advanced CS topics, such as IoT. For example, a need of students who have less prior CS knowledge than others may be to review programming concepts in order to be successful in the course. We have also identified a positive change in student’s attitudes towards computer science after the first two modules. These insights provide the CS education community with ways to engage students with concepts that they have not been exposed to and how to increase their interest in CS. Implications. The CSF curriculum is currently online, and is available to computer science instructors. Each module is separated into eight to nine units which are accompanied by activities and teaching guides. This curriculum provides educators with materials and activities to introduce students to more advanced CS topics, either through individual modules or as an entire course. In future research, we plan to use CSF in an outreach program and implement the course in two secondary classrooms in the 2023-2024 school year.",International Computing Education Research Workshop,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3568812.3603483?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3568812.3603483, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

56a1d8750ff00292d6729a7304a24d96ee2e7616,A Bibliometric Analysis of Immunotherapy in Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from 2004 to 2024.,"INTRODUCTION
Immunotherapy in DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma disease) has become an active research area with great value and potential. However, bibliometric research in this area is still sparse. Through bibliometric analysis, we aimed to visualize the research hot spots and trends of immunotherapy in DLBCL disease to help understand the future development of basic and clinical research.


METHODS
The Web of Science Core Collection database was searched for articles and reviews related to the immunotherapy of DLBCL from 2004 to 2024. VOSviewers, CiteSpace, and the R package ""bibliometrix"" were used to conduct the bibliometric analysis.


RESULTS
A total of 662 articles were included. The number of immunotherapy treatments in DLBCL increased year by year. The publications came from 55 countries, led by the United States and the People's Republic of China, and 1,349 institutions, with the leading research institutions being The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Leukemia & lymphoma is the journal with the most research, and Blood is the journal with the most co-citations. We identified 4833 authors, among which Young and Ken H had the most significant articles, while Neelapu SS had the largest number of co-citations. After analysis, the most common keyword is CAR T. CAR T cells (chimeric antigen receptor T cells immunotherapy), a current and developing area of research.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first bibliometric study to comprehensively summarize research trends and advances in immunotherapy in DLBCL disease. This information will provide a reference for researchers and healthcare providers in immunotherapy research by clarifying recent research frontiers and hotspots such as CAR T cells, bispecific antibodies, and so on.",Acta Haematologica,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1159/000545152?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1159/000545152, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Background OA is a chronic disease that affects the joints and their surrounding tissues, leading to progressive damage to the articular cartilage and ultimately to the subchondral bone and the surrounding synovial structures. OA is a disabling disease with an increasing incidence and prevalence in the general population. Modulation of immunity and inflammation and improvement of cell survival and differentiation through multidirectional differentiation of stem cells is a potential strategy for the treatment of OA. Methods We searched for publications on “stem cell therapy for osteoarthritis” in the Web of Science (WOS) core collection database from 1998–2024 and summarized the results, including year of publication, country, institution, author, and collaborative network generated using VOSviewer and Citespace. In addition, research trends were identified. Finally, we summarized the hot topics and identified future research trends. Results This study ultimately included 2341 valid papers, with a trend toward a gradual increase in the number of publications over time. The country, institution, author, and journal with the highest number of publications and citations were China, the University of California system, Sekiya I, and Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, respectively. High-frequency keyword clusters included cell therapy, stem cells, tissue engineering, and extracellular vesicles. Conclusion Through visualization and analysis, we elucidated the trends and research hotspots in the field over the past five years.

This bibliometric study analyzed eating disorder research from 1975 to 2024, examining publication trends, research themes, and the relationship between public engagement and academic attention over five decades.


METHODS
Data were collected from PubMed, Web of Science, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Publication trends were analyzed, and leading journals were identified. Network analysis using VOSviewer identified thematic clusters, while a bump chart visualized changes in key research terms over time. Trends, associations, and influencing factors of public engagement and academic attention were assessed using Altmetric Attention Scores per Year (AASPY) and citations per year (CPY).


RESULTS
A total of 101,993 publications were analyzed. Research output increased significantly, with the International Journal of Eating Disorders as the leading contributor. Six major research clusters were identified, and eight key terms (humans, female, anorexia nervosa, adult, adolescent, male, feeding and eating disorders, and child) remained dominant across all decades. AASPY and CPY increased over time but showed a weak correlation (R2 = 9.09%), suggesting that digital engagement was not strongly associated with scholarly attention. Studies on young adults and those published in multidisciplinary journals had higher online engagement, while research on female and young adult populations, as well as neuroscience, received greater academic attention.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings highlight the sustained growth of research output, the persistence of core thematic areas, and the divergence between public engagement and academic attention.

cea0211c18f844a600a696e080fc4c4d1cee88a8,Motivational Factors Affecting Computer Science Enrollment,"Internationally, the interest in science, technology, engineering, and math, or STEM, has led many countries to enact education policies aimed at generating more attention to STEM careers among its primary and secondary students. Driven by the supposed need for more STEM field workers, the movement has perhaps failed to look closely at what it is that drives the need and where the actual needs lie. Within the STEM career field lies jobs from nurse to field biologist to civil engineer to computer programmer [7]. However, there is also a large demand for computer science, field that is often swallowed up by the larger STEM interest. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics [2], computing jobs will make up 66% of all science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) jobs between 2014-2024 in the United States. However, only 8.48% of college STEM majors are in the computer science (CS) field [2] and there are over 500,000 unfilled computing jobs in the United States alone, but less than 50,000 CS graduates [3]. With the documented need for more CS workers, matched with very little primary and secondary CS education research and slow movements to enact policy, we have reached a critical point where it is important to understand more about what factors motivate students to enter the CS career field and how educators can use these factors to help direct and support more students to fill the important job sector that so desperately needs skilled employees. Using the expectancy-value theory (EVT) as a framework, this poster presents a study that looks at factors that could serve as predictors for enrollment in high school CS electives. EVT posits that individuals who are given options, particularly around course and career choices, make their decision based on how they expect to perform at the task and what value they see it having in their life. Value can be further broken into utility value, intrinsic value, attainment value, and cost [4, 5, 9]. This framework for understanding student motivations for STEM has been used and validated multiple times [1, 6, 8], so this study hopes to build on that proven reliability to understand student motivations with regard to CS. Using the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:2009) This poster presents a work-in-progress that looks at what factors during the ninth grade (first year secondary) year are predictors of a student's enrollment in any CS course during high school.",Conference on Global Computing Education,2019.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3300115.3312510?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3300115.3312510, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9bff29460352d9bc2c60f3f7a04cc0e2d56dae44,Next-Generation Models for Predicting Winning Times in Elite Swimming Events: Updated Predictions for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.,"PURPOSE
To evaluate statistical models developed for predicting medal-winning performances for international swimming events and generate updated performance predictions for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.


METHODS
The performance of 2 statistical models developed for predicting international swimming performances was evaluated. The first model employed linear regression and forecasting to examine performance trends among medal winners, finalists, and semifinalists over an 8-year period. A machine-learning algorithm was used to generate time predictions for each individual event for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The second model was a Bayesian framework and comprised an autoregressive term (the previous winning time), moving average (past 3 events), and covariates for stroke, gender, distance, and type of event (World Championships vs Olympic Games). To examine the accuracy of the predictions from both models, the mean absolute error was determined between the predicted times for the Budapest 2022 World Championships and the actual results from said championships.


RESULTS
The mean absolute error for prediction of swimming performances was 0.80% for the linear-regression machine-learning model and 0.85% for the Bayesian model. The predicted times and actual times from the Budapest 2022 World Championships were highly correlated (r = .99 for both approaches).


CONCLUSIONS
These models, and associated predictions for swimming events at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, provide an evidence-based performance framework for coaches, sport-science support staff, and athletes to develop and evaluate training plans, strategies, and tactics, as well as informing resource allocation to athletes, based on their potential for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.",International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,2023.0,7,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1123/ijspp.2023-0174?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2023-0174, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric and systematic review of 33 years (1991-2024) of research on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications in T2DM prediction. It highlights the growing complexity of the field and identifies key trends, methodologies, and research gaps. Methods A systematic methodology guided the literature selection process, starting with keyword identification using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and expert input. Based on these refined keywords, literature was systematically selected using PRISMA guidelines, resulting in a dataset of 2,351 articles from Web of Science and Scopus databases. Bibliometric analysis was performed on the entire selected dataset using tools such as VOSviewer and Bibliometrix, enabling thematic clustering, co-citation analysis, and network visualization. To assess the most impactful literature, a dual-criteria methodology combining relevance and impact scores was applied. Articles were qualitatively assessed on their alignment with T2DM prediction using a four-point relevance scale and quantitatively evaluated based on citation metrics normalized within subject, journal, and publication year. Articles scoring above a predefined threshold were selected for detailed review. The selected literature spans four time periods: 1991–2000, 2001–2010, 2011–2020, and 2021–2024. Results The bibliometric findings reveal exponential growth in publications since 2010, with the USA and UK leading contributions, followed by emerging players like Singapore and India. Key thematic clusters include foundational ML techniques, epidemiological forecasting, predictive modelling, and clinical applications. Ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and deep learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) dominate recent advancements. Literature analysis reveals that, early studies primarily used demographic and clinical variables, while recent efforts integrate genetic, lifestyle, and environmental predictors. Additionally, literature analysis highlights advances in integrating real-world datasets, emerging trends like federated learning, and explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).

f3920d2d3c017fe91b844cfe5873e2df41cbfb12,Impact and development of sport sponsorship: a three-decade bibliometric analysis (1993–2024),"PurposeThis study aims to provide a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of sports sponsorship research over the last 3 decades (1993–2024). By mapping the intellectual landscape of this field, the study seeks to identify key trends, prominent themes and the most influential authors and journals. Furthermore, the research addresses the ongoing challenge of evaluating the effectiveness of sponsorship investments, particularly in the digital age. The goal is to highlight emerging research areas.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs a bibliometric analysis using the SPAR-4-SLR protocol to systematically review the literature on sports sponsorship from 1993 to 2024. Data were sourced from the Web of Science (WoS) database, filtering results for articles written in English and excluding non-academic publications. A combination of bibliometric techniques – co-citation, co-word and co-authorship network analysis – was applied to examine intellectual structures and trends in the field. The Bibliometrix software was used for data analysis, providing a comprehensive evaluation of research productivity, collaboration patterns and emerging themes.FindingsThe bibliometric analysis reveals a significant increase in global sports sponsorship research, with a 12.69% annual growth rate from 1993 to 2024. Key themes such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), consumer behaviour and government regulation emerged as central topics. The study also highlights growing research interest in digital sponsorships, particularly within the eSports industry. Additionally, co-authorship analysis demonstrates increasing international collaboration, with 30.2% of publications involving multiple countries. The findings provide a clearer understanding of the intellectual landscape of sports sponsorship and suggest emerging research opportunities, particularly in digital marketing and advanced data analytics.Research limitations/implicationsThe analysis relies solely on the WoS database, which may have excluded relevant publications indexed in other databases such as Scopus or Google Scholar. Although WoS provides high-quality data, future research should integrate multiple databases to achieve a more comprehensive coverage of the field. Additionally, this study focuses primarily on articles published in English, potentially overlooking significant contributions from non-English sources.Originality/valueThis study provides a unique contribution by conducting the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis of sports sponsorship research over a 30-year period (1993–2024). By applying the SPAR-4-SLR protocol, it identifies emerging research areas such as the integration of big data and the role of psychophysiological methods in measuring sponsorship effectiveness. The research also highlights the increasing importance of digital sponsorship in industries like eSports. This work offers new insights into global collaboration patterns and reveals underexplored topics like the balance between global and local sponsorship strategies, thus providing valuable directions for future research and practical applications.","Sport, Business and Management: An International Journal",2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1108/sbm-09-2024-0134?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1108/sbm-09-2024-0134, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This bibliometric study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the history of empowerment in nursing using Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS).


METHODS
Descriptive and bibliometric analyses were conducted. The study is based on 762 publications from 1983 to 2024, with 14,582 cited references in the Web of Science. The reference publication period was divided into three sub-periods, with a total of 17 peaks identified: four from the first period (earliest to 1980), six from the second (1981-2000), and seven from the last period (2001-2024). Data analysis was performed using RPYS with the CRExplorer.


RESULTS
Ten significant historical root publications, dating back to 1859, were identified, focusing on leadership, professionalism, social psychology, and philosophy of education. The earliest roots are linked to Florence Nightingale. In the recent period, there was a greater number of nursing-based root publications cited.


CONCLUSION
This study is the first to identify the origins of influential nursing empowerment publications using RPYS. The earliest publications referenced in nursing empowerment literature originate from nursing.

a7647e22937c9195eda0e3fb2e2341098ff8fda5,“Beyond the Finish Line” the Epidemiology of Injury and Illness in Professional Cycling: Insights from a Year-Long Prospective Study,"Introduction: Injury and illness rates within cycling are a growing concern for riders, medical personnel, and event organisers. This study is the first to document injury and illness rates in professional cyclists throughout one competitive season including training and racing. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted with 47 professional cyclists (30 males and 17 females) over the 2024 season (1 November 2023–31 October 2024). Injuries and illnesses were defined and recorded following the International Olympic Committee (IOC) consensus guidelines for injury reporting in sports and its cycling-specific extension. Data collection utilised a centralised online hub, integrating exposure metrics (e.g., training hours and kilometres) and medical records. All data were processed on a Macintosh computer using the Microsoft Office and R statistics packages epi tools, binom.test function, and ggplot. (V.4.3.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Ethical approval was obtained from Queens University Belfast, number MHLS 23_175. Results: Fifty-five injury events were logged, with 1.15 (±0.359) locations injured per incidence and 1.57 (±1.06) injury types per incident. The overall combined injury rate for racing was 4.14 (95% CI: 2.65–5.79) per 1000 h of exposure, with the overall combined rate for training being 1.23 (95% CI: 0.8–1.7) per 1000 h. The injury risk ratio (RR) for injury during racing and training for females was 11.10 (95% CI: 2.69–37.60), and the RR for males was 10.24 (95% CI: 3.84–43.06), both indicating there is a significantly higher risk of injury during racing compared to training. Abrasions were the most common injury type, with fractures being the most burdensome injury. The most common illness was upper respiratory, 0.63 (95% CI: 0.27–0.99) per year for males and 1.11 (95% CI: 0.64–1.59) per year for females. Saddle sores were the second most common at 0.20 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.36) per year for males and 0.08 (95% CI: 0–0.18) per year for females. Conclusions: This study provides the first comprehensive, season-long surveillance data for injuries and illnesses in male and female professional road cycling, highlighting the significant differences in injury profiles between racing and training. These results underscore the need for targeted injury prevention strategies and the establishment of a standardised injury and illness framework for professional cycling.",Sports,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3390/sports13010020', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11769022, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d128f8ef134aa82503634465bb446eea47305448,Leveraging Computer-Based Simulations and Immersive Software Technologies for Enhanced Student Learning in Laboratory Medicine.,"Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students are typically taught content delivered didactically and closely aligned with the laboratory demonstration of concepts, which facilitates the development of experimental skills. Due to the volume of content delivered across multiple courses, student cognitive abilities can be affected, leading to lower student performance. In physiology and related biological sciences, educators have turned to delivering content using virtual teaching technologies, including virtual and augmented reality, simulations, and other immersive platforms. At the University of South Australia, Articulate Storyline, Unity-based simulations, and immersive software platforms have been implemented across the entire Laboratory Medicine program to assist students in learning lecture and laboratory content. The impact of these individual interventions is outlined in this manuscript. In addition, the final year 2024 cohort is the first group who have used simulations throughout their degree. Evidence of the benefits and impact of the scaffolded implementation of simulations and immersive software was obtained through a Likert-style questionnaire. The deployment of simulations and immersive software across the degree has significantly enhanced student learning, and engagement with the content effectively bridging the gap between understanding lecture and laboratory content of students in the Laboratory Medicine program. We suggest that a similar approach could readily be embedded within individual courses as well as across science programs to provide the same benefits to student learning.",Advances in Physiology Education,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1152/advan.00128.2024?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00128.2024, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1a335bf08ab13fe099912883072def81083142b0,COMPLIANCE WITH NEW LANGUAGE NORMS BY UKRAINIAN NATIONAL AND REGIONAL MEDIA (COMPUTER ANALYSIS),"Introduction. In May 2024, a five-year transition period for the introduction of new norms of Ukrainian spelling passed. Since journalists are obliged to constantly improve their language skills, it was decided to investigate the extent to which leading Ukrainian media (national and regional) adhere to the new language norms.
Relevance and purpose. The purpose of the article is to analyze the Ukrainian online mass media in terms of compliance with the new language norms of the current edition of spelling with the help of computer analysis and to identify possible violations of these norms. We consider such work to be relevant, since the media’s readers literacy may partly depend on the level of compliance with language norms by popular media; the readers may borrow both correct and incorrect cases of using certain words and expressions. In addition, in the conditions of the full-scale invasion of Russia, the purity of the Ukrainian language and its popularization acquires additional importance.
Methodology. With the help of computer programs (Python language), more than 7 thousand news items from all-Ukrainian and regional media sites for June 2024 were downloaded and processed. Dictionaries were developed to detect compliance or violation of language norms.
The results. The study showed that online mass media have a positive tendency to use the updated language norms (compared to 2019 and 2021), in particular, writing words in a single approved form and using feminine forms, in journalistic texts, while variant spellings of some words remain out of the attention of journalists. The situation is also partly different in the media with different spheres of distribution: all-Ukrainian media are more inclined to introduce language changes in their texts regarding foreign language components and individual words, while local ones are not in such a hurry to do so or avoid certain orthographic norms.
Conclusions. The study helped identify leading trends in the use of the new spelling and confirmed the applicability of computer analysis to such cases. As for further research, we see the need to continue monitoring compliance with language norms, as well as to supplement it with research using other methods for a deeper understanding of the level of literacy of Ukrainian media and journalists.",Obraz,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.21272/obraz.2025.1(47)-133-143', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21272/obraz.2025.1(47)-133-143?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21272/obraz.2025.1(47)-133-143, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This “Stunde der Gartenvögel” (hour of the garden birds) aims at obtaining a yearly overview of the birds in villages and towns. While this birdwatching action gives a broad overview due to the large number of gardens and parks involved (around 40,000 in the year 2024), several drawbacks must be mentioned that may impede the comparability of the counted bird numbers from one year to another. Here we give an overview of the chronological development of the overall numbers of species and specifically of the most frequent garden birds. We discuss correlations with external factors, such as weather and numbers of participants, and compare the results with ornithological studies in the same period as well as with the results of the yearly Birdrace in Germany, where ornithologically interested people count birds in a defined area on the full first Saturday in May. The main drawback of the citizen science project was found to be misidentifications of birds, especially evident in the case of the Tree Sparrow, combined with birds not being recorded because they could not be identified. The main advantage, on the other hand, is the large amount of data from the “Stunde der Gartenvögel”, which is important for measuring especially the trends of well-known, frequent species much better than the Birdrace. Ideally, all data taken in different ways should be combined, and misinterpretations should be reduced by showing male and female birds of species with strong gender dimorphism.",Diversity,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3390/d17020078', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/d17020078?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/d17020078, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This qualitative case study explored the root causes of physics aversion among Grade 12 STEM students at RPMD National Science High School in Marawi City, Philippines. Ten Grade 12 students enrolled in the 2023-2024 academic year were selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected through one-on-one in-depth interviews to capture participants’ perceptions and experiences with physics. The audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. From the data, 15 codes emerged, which were grouped into four overarching themes: Mathematical Challenges, Teaching-Related Issues, Language and Comprehension, and Personal and Social Factors. Key findings revealed that mathematical challenges, such as difficulty with complex equations, problem-solving, and formula memorization, were the most frequently cited barriers. These issues were often exacerbated by mathematics anxiety and inadequate foundational skills. Teaching-related issues, including ineffective instructional methods, disorganized presentations, and lack of engagement, significantly hindered students’ understanding and interest. Language barriers, especially in decoding technical terminology and understanding word problems, compounded these difficulties. Personal and social factors, including a lack of interest in physics, peer influence, and perceived irrelevance to future career goals, further contributed to the aversion. The study highlights the urgent need for student-centered teaching approaches, such as active learning strategies, differentiated instruction, and linguistic scaffolding, to address these challenges. Policymakers and educators are encouraged to implement holistic interventions to create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment. Future research should investigate these dynamics across diverse educational contexts and assess the impact of targeted interventions on reducing physics aversion.",International journal of research and innovation in social science,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47772/ijriss.2024.803465s?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2024.803465s, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 Citizen science as a form of inquiry inviting nonprofessionals into different phases of the research process appeared in linguistics in the last decade. However, few such projects aim to study dialectal features, even though renewal would benefit dialectology. This methodological paper explores possible ways of applying citizen science in research on dialects. A specific small-scale study is presented which was conducted in the 2023/2024 academic year in Hungary with high school citizen scientists living in the Northern (so-called Palóc) dialect area. In this study, experimental and citizen scientific methods were combined, resulting in a corpus consisting of unique dialect data suitable for the acoustic study of inter- and intra-speaker variation, recorded without the presence of professional researchers. Drawing on the experiences of this project, the article examines how the contribution to science and the contribution to the public, two important criteria of citizen science projects, were achieved.

Research, development and innovation are key factors in remaining competitive in the international sports competition.
Since 2018, the funds available for applied sports science have been significantly increased. With a budget of CHF 1.5 million per year, Swiss Olympic's ‘Sports Science’ funding programme is an essential source of funding for Swiss elite sport.
The aim of the ‘Sports Science’ funding programme is to promote practice-oriented (sports) science in the federations. This is to be achieved on the one hand by subsidising scientific staff and on the other by promoting scientific measures and projects.
In addition, the Sports Innovation Hub was launched in 2024 to increase competitiveness through innovative ideas and collaborative approaches. A maximum funding application of CHF 200,000 can be triggered per project. The fundings are awarded exclusively to national member federations of Swiss Olympic through applications.
The ‘embedded scientist’, a (sports) scientist embedded in the federation structure, is proving to be a promising model for conducting the most targeted and practice-oriented research possible due to its proximity to athletes, coaches and officials.
Nevertheless, linking universities, research and business remains a challenge, one of the three key points of Stöckli's (Chef de Mission Swiss Olympic) final statements after the 2024 Summer Olympics.

edfecf33b337e3c180ca2c878f6d4736da22e134,188 Undergraduate outreach to foster student interest in clinical and translational science career pathways: Creation of a certificate and CTS Roadshow programming,"Objectives/Goals: Academic research centers struggle to recruit and retain a diverse, competent clinical and translational science (CTS) workforce. The clinical research professional career pathway is particularly underrecognized among undergraduates, despite offering multiple career opportunities. Methods/Study Population: To address these challenges, two undergraduate outreach programs were developed. First, an undergraduate certificate program in CTS (UC-CTS) was designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to enter the workforce immediately after graduation. Second, a “CTS Roadshow” was launched to build awareness of CTS careers within a variety of undergraduate programs and majors. In this recruitment initiative, principal investigators (PIs) and CRPs visit classrooms to share information about CTS career pathways and offer insights into the roles, responsibilities, and professional opportunities available in the field. Results/Anticipated Results: The UC-CTS program launched in Fall 2024 as a 12-credit certificate that includes two paid internships: one in patient care and one in research. Currently, the program has 5 students enrolled with an anticipated increase in enrollment to 20 students by Spring 2025. Similarly, the CTS Roadshow has reached an increasing number of students each year. Since its inception in Spring 2023, the CTS Roadshow has introduced over 750 undergraduates across 21 courses to CTS careers. The CTS Roadshow has engaged students from a variety of majors, including biology, psychology, medical sciences, legal, finance, accounting, and pre-health programs, increasing awareness of and interest in CTS careers. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Both programs aim to expose students to CTS careers early in their education, better preparing them for full-time CTS roles after graduation. A rise in qualified applicants pursuing CTS careers locally and regionally is expected, improving job satisfaction and retention through enhanced preparation for the career field.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.843', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/cts.2024.843?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.843, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

070efee87dfac5a3301cd94ebedd08f43cd2560e,Assessing the quality of life among African medical and health science students using the WHOQOL-BREF tool,"Background The quality of life (QoL) among health professional students is available in the literature, yet there is a paucity of information concerning QoL among African students. The study aimed to measure the QoL with the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) tool among African medical and health science students. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 349 African medical and health science students from various disciplines at the International African University in May 2024. A purposive sampling method was used to recruit participants from five different faculties. Data were collected using the WHOQOL-BREF tool, and analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test and multiple linear regression to determine the predictors of QoL among students. Results The overall QoL among 349 African medical and health science students was moderate, with a mean score of 67.5% ± 10.8%. The highest mean scores were observed in the physical health domain (69.3% ± 12.0%), while the lowest scores were in the environmental domain (62.9% ± 12.0%). The multiple regression analysis using demographic data as predictors of QoL revealed that dentistry students were significant predictors of higher overall QoL scores compared to other student groups (β = 7.059, p < 0.05), as well as specific QoL domains including physical health (β = 6.328), psychological health (β = 8.415), social relationships (β = 7.823), and environment (β = 7.017). Furthermore, students from the fields of laboratory sciences and medicine significantly predicted higher scores in the physical health domain (β = 5.223) and the psychological health domain (β = 4.433), respectively. Age was also a significant predictor; students aged between 20 and 23 years showed a positive impact on social relationship domain of QoL (β = 10.296). However, second year (β = −11.146), third year (β = −13.629), and fourth-year students (β = −10.144) exhibited lower social relationship domain of QoL scores. Conclusion Students of medical and health sciences in Africa exhibited moderate quality of life (QoL). The findings indicate that dentistry students generally experience higher QoL across multiple domains, which contrasts with students from other disciplines, such as pharmacy and nursing. Age and academic year were also significant predictors of QoL, with younger students and those in their initial years of study reporting lower scores. These results align with existing literature and underscore the need for targeted interventions to support students, particularly those in high-stress disciplines or at earlier stages of their education.",PeerJ,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.18809', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11809301, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

22e398b668ec4e6029fa76c640fcf411b0556ff6,Guided Endodontics for Non-surgical Root Canal Retreatment: A Systematic Review,"Introduction: This systematic review compared the accuracy of guided endodontics with the conventional method in non-surgical endodontic retreatment. Methods: Two reviewers conducted a systematic search across PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria consisted of all in vitro studies up to October 2024 that documented the application of cone-beam computed tomography in creating a guide for endodontic retreatment cases. The reviewers assessed the quality of the selected studies using the QUIN tool. Data regarding the first author and publication year, sample size, tooth type, retreatment application, computer-aided navigation technique, groups, image acquisition method, outcome measures, guided technique results, conventional technique results, and the main results were extracted using a predefined template. Results: Based on our criteria, seven studies were included in this review. The studies demonstrated variability in the techniques utilized. Iatrogenic errors were less frequent in guided groups, regardless of the operator’s level of experience. Most studies indicated that guided endodontics was more effective than conventional methods, particularly in fiber post-removal and access through MTA, minimizing volumetric loss of tooth structure, and preserving fracture resistance. However, when using guided techniques for removal of separated instruments, more iatrogenic errors occurred, and more time was required compared to the freehand technique. Conclusion: Guided endodontics has shown promise in improving the outcomes of non-surgical retreatment by reducing complications. However, as all included studies were in vitro, clinical evidence is lacking, and the generalization of these results should be done cautiously. Further well-designed clinical studies are required to confirm these findings.",Iranian endodontic journal,2025.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11808322, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f9a776993a29250c358dd92c1f52c05e9c3516f2,Redesigning library orientation for first-year medical students during the pandemic,"Background: Prior to 2020, library orientation for first-year medical students at Weill Cornell Medicine took the form of an on-site treasure hunt competition. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the orientation for the MD class of 2024 was shifted to an all-virtual format. This shift mandated a full redesign of the library orientation. Case Presentation: The Samuel J. Wood Library sought to preserve the excitement and fun of the treasure hunt in the new virtual format. The competition was redesigned as a Zoom meeting using breakout rooms, with library faculty and staff serving as team facilitators. Tasks were rewritten, shifting the focus from the library's physical spaces to its virtual services and online resources. The redesigned orientation was evaluated using two data sources: a postsession survey of student participants and a debriefing of the library employees who participated. Student evaluations were positive, while the faculty and staff provided numerous suggestions for improving future virtual orientations. Conclusions: A successful virtual library orientation requires careful preparation, including testing the competition tasks, full rehearsal with library facilitators, and a thoughtful approach to technology and logistics. We have chosen to share the materials we developed for other academic health sciences libraries that may wish to take a similar approach to their own virtual orientations.",Journal of the Medical Library Association,2021.0,7,"{'url': 'https://jmla.pitt.edu/ojs/jmla/article/download/1190/1333', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8485957, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

45fcc37526b8c102bc10deccbd0db9c2daf4c44e,Global Prevalence of Sexual Violence Against Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Importance
Sexual violence against children is a global concern, yet worldwide figures of its prevalence are scant.


Objective
To estimate the global prevalence of sexual violence against children using national-level population-based studies.


Data Sources
We searched the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ERIC, and APA PsycArticles databases from their respective inceptions to March 2022. Searches were updated through April 2024.


Study Selection
Reports were included if (1) they were national-level population-based studies, (2) they reported lifetime or past-year prevalence data on any form of sexual violence against children (mean age ≤19 years), and (3) the data were based on children's self-reports of sexual violence perpetrated by anyone.


Data Extraction and Synthesis
Data extraction included study and participant characteristics, prevalence rates, and types of sexual violence. Outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model. Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed with categorical moderators.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Primary outcomes included lifetime and past-year prevalence of forced sexual intercourse, contact sexual violence, and sexual harassment.


Results
We identified 165 studies that included 958 182 children from 80 countries, with the majority of data focusing on girls (58.2%). The sample sizes of the studies ranged from 330 to 132 948; the mean age ranged from 10.5 to 19.4 years. Lifetime sexual harassment was the most prevalent outcome, with a pooled rate of 11.4% (95% CI, 8.5%-15.1%), followed by any contact sexual violence, with a rate of 8.7% (95% CI, 4.7%-15.5%). Furthermore, 6.1% (95% CI, 5.1%-7.3%) of children reported experiencing completed forced sexual intercourse in their lifetime, and 1.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-1.7%) reported experiencing it in the preceding year. Rates of lifetime completed forced sexual intercourse were higher among girls (6.8% [95% CI, 6.1%-7.6%]) compared with boys (3.3% [95% CI, 2.5%-4.3%]), similar to past-year violence (2.3% [95% CI 1.9%-2.7%] for girls and 0.6% [95% CI 0.4%-0.9%] for boys). We found considerable variation across regions and countries in the reported prevalence of sexual violence. Older age of children, lower national income levels, and the use of school-based surveys were associated with higher rates of sexual violence reporting in some exploratory analyses.


Conclusions and Relevance
The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the burden of sexual violence against children worldwide based on current available evidence. There is a pressing need to enhance data collection efforts globally, especially in underresearched regions and for boys.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar from inception to 4 July 2024. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Longitudinal studies on survival or nursing home admission in people with dementia. Studies with fewer than 150 participants, recruitment during acute hospital admission, or less than one year of follow-up were excluded. Results 19 307 articles were identified and 261 eligible studies included. 235 reported on survival among 5 553 960 participants and 79 reported on nursing home admission among 352 990 participants. Median survival from diagnosis appeared to be strongly dependent on age, ranging from 8.9 years at mean age 60 for women to 2.2 years at mean age 85 for men. Women overall had shorter survival than men (mean difference 4.1 years (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 6.1)), which was attributable to later age at diagnosis in women. Median survival was 1.2 to 1.4 years longer in Asia than in the US and Europe, and 1.4 years longer for Alzheimer’s disease compared with other types of dementia. Compared with studies before 2000, survival was longer in contemporary clinic based studies (Ptrend=0.02), but not in community based studies. Taken together, variation in reported clinical characteristics and study methodology explained 51% of heterogeneity in survival. Median time to nursing home admission was 3.3 years (interquartile range 1.9 to 4.0). 13% of people were admitted in the first year after diagnosis, increasing to 57% at five years, but few studies appropriately accounted for competing mortality risk when assessing admission rates. Conclusions The average life expectancy of people with dementia at time of diagnosis ranged from 5.7 years at age 65 to 2.2 at age 85 in men and from 8.0 to 4.5, respectively, in women. About one third of remaining life expectancy was lived in nursing homes, with more than half of people moving to a nursing home within five years after a dementia diagnosis. Prognosis after a dementia diagnosis is highly dependent on personal and clinical characteristics, offering potential for individualised prognostic information and care planning.

f45d26ef057207fab84e78b13c20e2d25c5b6cb6,A contentious intervention to support the medical workforce: a case study of the policy of introducing physician associates in the United Kingdom,"Background Health systems across Europe are facing a workforce crisis, with some experiencing severe shortages of doctors. In response, many are exploring greater task-sharing, across established professions, such as doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, with patients and carers, and with new occupational groups, in particular ones that can assist doctors and relieve their workload. Case presentation In the early 2000s the United Kingdom created a new occupational role, that of physician assistant. They had a science degree and then underwent a 2-year postgraduate training course. The name soon changed, to physician associate, and the range of roles and responsibilities expanded greatly, although in a largely unregulated manner; by 2024, some were undertaking complex procedures or managing undifferentiated patients in primary care. Catalysed by some high-profile failings, this expansion has generated major concerns, over patient safety and consent, the scope of practice and preferential employment conditions of this group, the adverse consequences for medical training, and the additional medical workload involved in supervision. This has led to a widespread grassroots backlash by the medical profession, often challenging their leaders who had supported this idea. As a consequence, professional bodies that were initially in favour are now expressing serious concerns and it seems likely that the roles and responsibilities of physician associates (and related occupations) will be curtailed. We review published literature and official documentation about this policy to understand the drivers of its development, its benefits, and risks. Conclusions The experience in the UK offers cautionary lessons for other European countries contemplating similar ideas. It underscores the importance of maintaining trust with those affected by change, undertaking a detailed systems analysis with attention to risks of unintended consequences, agreeing clear role definitions, providing adequate regulatory oversight, and the need to avoid damaging training of future doctors. This case study highlights the need for a carefully thought-out approach that considers both the potential benefits and pitfalls of integrating new roles like physician associates into a healthcare system. The failure to do so has created a new occupational group with unrealistic expectations and has further demoralised an already unhappy medical profession.",Human Resources for Health,2025.0,2,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-024-00966-1', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11748592, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

912936e9372be2cd1a61110947795a6a3d0e012c,A case study on the perception of artificial intelligence by gifted students in Turkey,"The research was conducted to explore the perceptions of gifted students towards artificial intelligence (AI) using a qualitative research method and a case study design. The study group comprised 25 students from the Selçuklu Science and Art Center during the 2023-2024 academic year, selected through affinity sampling method. Data was gathered through metaphoric forms and semi-structured interviews, and content analysis was employed for data analysis. The findings indicated that students primarily used the human metaphor when discussing AI. Themes derived from the metaphors included human similarity, potential threats of AI, and belief in the benefits of AI. Gifted students expressed concern about the potential risks of AI, while also highlighting its advantages in education. Additionally, the majority of students believed that schools would continue to operate within an AI-supported education system, although some students expressed the view that AI could make schools obsolete. According to the findings, gifted students have expressed a perception of AI as being advantageous as well as having potential risks. Consequently, the research suggests that it would be beneficial to offer specialized training to gifted students on the responsible utilization of AI within the realm of education.",Journal of Digital Educational Technology,2025.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30935/jdet/15809?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30935/jdet/15809, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In randomized clinical trials of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for de novo small-vessel coronary artery disease (SV-CAD), paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) angioplasty showed mid-term angiographic or clinical non-inferiority to drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. Nevertheless, these trials have sample size limitations, and the relative safety and efficacy beyond the first year remain uncertain.


METHODS
The ANDROMEDA study was a collaborative, investigator-initiated, individual patient data meta-analysis comparing 3 year clinical outcomes between PCB angioplasty and DES implantation for the treatment of de novo SV-CAD. Multiple electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science) were searched from May 2010 to June 2024 to identify eligible trials. All the following eligibility criteria were required: (i) random allocations of treatments; (ii) patients with SV-CAD; (iii) treatment with PCB or DES; and (iv) clinical follow-up of at least 36 months. The primary and co-primary endpoints were major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and target lesion failure (TLF), respectively. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023479035).


RESULTS
Individual patient data from three randomized trials, including a total of 1154 patients and 1360 lesions, were combined. At 3 years, PCB was associated with a lower risk of MACE compared with DES [hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.96], due to a lower risk of myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization. This benefit persisted after multivariable adjustment (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96), but did not reach statistical significance in the two-stage analysis (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.43-1.04). At the landmark analysis, the risk of MACE between groups was consistent over time. At 3 years, TLF was not significantly different between PCB and DES groups. Reconstructed time-to-event information from a fourth trial was included in a sensitivity analysis (1384 patients and 1590 lesions), showing consistent results in terms of TLF (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.63-1.20). The comparison between PCB and second-generation DES did not reveal significant differences in 3 year TLF (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.70-1.50).


CONCLUSIONS
In patients undergoing PCI for de novo SV-CAD, PCB angioplasty is associated with a reduction in MACE and a non-significant difference in TLF at 3 year follow-up compared with DES implantation. The restriction of the comparator group to second-generation DES does not alter the main conclusions. Larger trials comparing contemporary devices at a more prolonged follow-up are warranted to confirm these findings.",European Heart Journal,2025.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf002?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf002, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

35c1c575cb335d535eb7ebefbc3cc6e70530ecab,Medication Abortion: Current State and Changing Information on University Student Health Center Websites,"ABSTRACT Background The reversal of the federal right to abortion through the 2022 US Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is changing the landscape for medication abortion access. Several states with supportive abortion laws are expanding access to medication abortion by mandating that university Student Health Centers (SHCs) provide this service. Meanwhile, other states are limiting even the information that medical providers can give to patients. In this environment, we document changing information on medication abortion on university SHC websites. Methods We conducted thematic content analysis for medication abortion‐related information on 549 SHC websites at 4‐year bachelor's degree granting public universities/colleges across the United States. We examined information on medication abortion at four timepoints: March 2022, August 2022, February 2023, and February 2024 using computer‐assisted software. Results Only 1% of the SHC websites detailed information on access to medication abortion in March 2022. By February 2024, 7.5% of SHC websites provided some information on how to access medication abortion. This increase was driven primarily by SHC websites of public colleges in California, New York, and Massachusetts, where legislation required SHC to provide medication abortion services on campuses. For universities that provided any information on medication abortion, the websites had varying details on access and responses to changing state‐level legislation and federal regulations. Conclusions Overall, university SHC websites are increasingly mentioning medication abortion, though mostly in states with supportive abortion laws. We anticipate more SHCs will post such information on their websites in response to legal requirements set by state legislatures.",Perspectives on sexual and reproductive health,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11936862, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Utilizing PDSA Cycles in Event Planning for Student Success: An Analysis of Marshall University's Donuts with the Deans Events. 
  
The utilization of the improvement science Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle framework allows for the scientific analysis of event effectiveness and goal attainment for their optimization. This article focuses on disseminating the quantitative analyses paired with an extensive literature review from the implementation of PDSA cycles for a biannual, intervallic ""Donuts with the Deans"" social event held on Marshall University’s campus for the 2024 year. The event aimed to connect first-generation and rural STEM students with deans from their respective colleges in a neutral environment. At each event, student feedback was primarily recorded using digital surveys to gather information related to attendee demographics and background, social comfortability, and reception to event characteristics. First2 Network student leaders acted as conversation catalysts to help direct peers to the digital location of the survey, nurture event conversation, and distribute incentives among attendees. Preliminary analysis suggests that the horizontalization of relationship and communication hierarchies in the higher education realm empowers student voice, encourages participation within critical decision-making processes on campus, develops a more robust social capital, and fosters a sense of belonging within the STEM community. Furthermore, this paper discusses the benefits of social constructivism and student partnership in event development and facilitation.

Vitamin D has been related to cardiovascular health in addition to its well-known actions within the skeletal system through its inflammatory effects, effects on endothelial function, and ability to alter the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Nevertheless, these pathways explain the theoretical mechanisms of how vitamin D supplementation prevents and treats CVD, but clinical effectiveness has not been precisely established. To assess the impact of vitamin D in preventing cardiovascular illness and its outcomes, original research before the year 2024, using randomized controlled trials, cohorts, and meta-analysis, was included in this systematic review. As previously mentioned, a PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science search was performed and screened by quality and relevance. The present study presents an optimistic conclusion in some studies as there is a marked reduction in other risk factors, including blood pressure, lipid profiles, and arterial stiffness. However, other studies support a reduction or lack of benefit in some risk factors. These discrepancies seem to be influenced by differences in study type and duration, participants’ initial vitamin D levels, dose of supplement, and participants. Therefore, whether vitamin D supplementation should be issued universally for CVD prevention and management is still indistinct. This review provides a foundation on which targeted interventions may be designed and developed and demonstrates that more research is needed into the doses that might be effective and the patients most likely to benefit from them. Knowledge of the specifics of how vitamin D works in cardiovascular disease could be helpful in clinical guidelines and could help progress ways to limit global CVD.",Journal of Population Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.53555/knw3yw30?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.53555/knw3yw30, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A quasi-experimental research design was utilized, involving 12 purposively selected Grade 8 students from Rufino I. Chungalao Science High School (RICSHS), Ifugao, Philippines, during the school year 2024-2025. The selected respondents were divided into two groups: an experimental group, which used the E-LaB Game, and a control group, which followed conventional teaching methods. A 30-item validated identification test was administered as both a pre-test and post-test to assess learning gains. Statistical tools such as paired t-tests, independent t-tests, and effect size calculations (eta squared) were employed for data analysis. Results revealed that students who used the E-LaB Game demonstrated a remarkable improvement in their ability to determine the number of protons, electrons, and neutrons. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in students' performance before and after using the E-LaB Game, confirming its effectiveness as a learning and remediating tool to enhance their mastery in determining the number of protons, electrons, and neutrons. Based from the findings, it is recommended that more Element and ladder Board Game (E-LaB GAME) learning activities will be employed to reinforce the performance of the Grade 8 students to the number of protons, electrons and neutrons. To future researchers, the E-LaB GAME may be localized in order to be suitable and presentable to learners in a way that is more facilitating, stimulating, and exciting for the learners and become enthusiastic and eager to learn. In addition, to improve the reliability and generalizability of the research findings, consider increasing the sample size by adding more respondents.","Pedagogy Review: An International Journal of Educational Theories, Approaches and Strategies",2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.62718/vmca.pr-ijetas.4.2.sc-0125-030?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.62718/vmca.pr-ijetas.4.2.sc-0125-030, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9744fc64c922edbecfb4db50f8a7622e7318cf2d,Epistemic Oscillation: Living With Ocean Risks,"The year 2024 marks two decades since the Indian Ocean tsunami, known as the Boxing Day catastrophe, which far surpassed other devastating geological events of the 21st‐century on humankind. Paradoxically, the epitome of tsunamis carries regenerative agency. It moves science and technologies across territories, proliferates knowledge production, and boosts innovations of warning systems as a critical part of ocean risk governance. In many cases, humans gradually distanced themselves from memories of past events due to the “high risk and low return period” of events. Through diverse risk perceptions, cultures, and beliefs, coupled with rapid human mobilities, the once proliferated knowledge could also be unlearned and forgotten. When knowledge on tsunamis is scarce or about to become extinct, no earthly process greater than tsunamis could bring back and sustain such knowledge. Like tsunami waves, this article argues that knowledge also refracts and oscillates. This article proposes epistemic oscillation as a conceptual lens as one of the ways to understand complex human and non‐human entanglements, highlighting humans’ dependent relations to geological dynamics, using the cases of the Palu 2018 tsunami as a testbed. By doing so, the article also argues that such lenses are useful in tracing the importance of understanding ambiguities in tsunami risk governance. By deploying an affective turn to ocean materialities and micropolitics as research methods, this article proposes alternative ways to unfold the multiplicities of social and geological realities and epistemic mobilities in the hyper‐complex challenges of knowledge integration and ocean risk governance.",Ocean and Society,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17645/oas.8885?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17645/oas.8885, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The present study is exploratory and interpretative in nature, aiming to investigate the phenomenon of “brain rot”, with a focus on its key pillars, psychological factors, digital behaviors, and the cognitive impact resulting from the overconsumption of low-quality digital content. Methods: This study employs a rapid review approach, examining research published between 2023 and 2024 across PubMed, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. It explores the causes and effects of brain rot, focusing on the overuse of social media, video games, and other digital platforms. Results: The findings reveal that brain rot leads to emotional desensitization, cognitive overload, and a negative self-concept. It is associated with negative behaviors, such as doomscrolling, zombie scrolling, and social media addiction, all linked to psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. These factors impair executive functioning skills, including memory, planning, and decision-making. The pervasive nature of digital media, driven by dopamine-driven feedback loops, exacerbates these effects. Conclusions: The study concludes by offering strategies to prevent brain rot, such as controlling screen time, curating digital content, and engaging in non-digital activities. Given the increasing prevalence of digital engagement, it is essential to explore a variety of strategies, including mindful technology use, to support cognitive health and emotional well-being. The results can guide various stakeholders—policymakers, practitioners, researchers, educators, and parents or caregivers—in addressing the pervasive impact of brain rot and promoting a balanced approach to technology use that fosters cognitive resilience among adolescents and young adults.",Brain Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci15030283', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11939997, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods/Study Population: The first cohort of thirty-one students started in January 2024 and were organized into three groups that met weekly. One in-person group of students in Anchorage, AK; one in-person group in Seattle, WA; and a group of students from across the WWAMI region convened virtually. Students completed a year-long series of elective courses addressing fundamental concepts of designing, conducting, and presenting the results of a research project. Over the summer between year 1 and year 2 of medical school, students dedicated 8 weeks to full-time research activities under the supervision of their research project mentor. In Fall 2024, students prepared and presented research posters at regional poster sessions and abstracts and oral presentations for submission to the Western Medical Research Conference in January 2025. Results/Anticipated Results: The ultimate goal of the CTR pathway is to increase the number of medical providers across the WWAMI region with significant awareness, interest, and experience in research. Many students hesitate to engage in research due to a perceived lack of necessary skills. The CTR pathway addresses this gap by equipping students with the research competencies needed to participate confidently in scientific inquiry. Feedback from the inaugural cohort has been overwhelmingly positive, with many students highlighting how the CTR pathway enhanced their confidence and knowledge, empowering them to execute their proposed research projects successfully. Our second cohort of students joined the CTR pathway in January 2025.

The lack of learning resources that combine both aspects causes difficulties for teachers in designing lessons that link religious and scientific aspects. This study aims to analyze students' perceptions of the need for an IPA module integrated with Quranic verses on environmental pollution. This research uses a descriptive quantitative method with 20 students from class VIII-F Science at MTs Negeri 2 Ciamis in the 2024/2025 academic year, selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected using a questionnaire consisting of 10 statements across 3 indicators. The results of the study show that all indicators were rated positively: 1) students' views on environmental pollution material reached 81%, categorized as good; 2) students' views on the connection between science material and Quranic verses were also good, at 80%; and 3) students' views on the need for an IPA learning module reached 85%, categorized as good. The conclusion of this study is that students need a learning module integrated with Quranic verses because this integrated learning approach is considered to make the learning process more relevant, effective, and meaningful. Integrating Quranic verses into science learning can create a deeper and more effective learning experience, especially on the topic of environmental pollution. This approach helps students understand concepts holistically, encompassing both scientific and spiritual aspects.
ABSTRAKPembelajaran IPA di MTs N 2 Ciamis masih menggunakan bahan ajar terpisah, dimana mata pelajaran agama fokus pada topik keagamaan, sedangkan IPA terbatas pada materi sains tanpa integrasi nilai-nilai Islam. Keterbatasan sumber belajar yang menggabungkan keduanya menyebabkan kesulitan bagi guru dalam merancang pembelajaran yang menghubungkan aspek keagamaan dan ilmiah. Penelitian ini bertujuan menganalisis persepsi siswa terhadap kebutuhan modul IPA terintegrasi ayat Al-Qur'an pada pencemaran lingkungan. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode deskriptif kuantitatif dengan subjek sebanyak 20 siswa kelas VIII-F Sains di MTs Negeri 2 Ciamis tahun ajaran 2024/2025, yang ditentukan melalui teknik purposive sampling. Data diperoleh melalui pengisian angket yang berisi 10 pernyataan dalam 3 indikator. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan baik pada semua indikator, yaitu: 1) pandangan siswa terhadap materi pencemaran lingkungan sebesar 81% sehingga berkategori baik, 2) pandangan siswa terhadap keterkaitan materi IPA dengan ayat-ayat Al-Qur’an juga baik yaitu sebesar 80%, dan 3) pandangan siswa terhadap kebutuhan modul pembelajaran IPA sebesar 85% berkategori baik. Kesimpulan dari penelitian ini adalah siswa membutuhkan modul pembelajaran yang terintegrasi ayat-ayat Al-Qur’an, karena pembelajaran yang terintegrasi ini dinilai mampu membuat proses belajar lebih relevan, efektif, dan bermakna. Pengintegrasian ayat-ayat Al-Qur’an dalam pembelajaran IPA dapat menciptakan pengalaman belajar yang lebih mendalam dan efektif, khususnya pada materi pencemaran lingkungan.

2fc03b115925c408bbce25fc29af256b8d2b2eae,Combined use of the integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework with other implementation frameworks: a systematic review,"Background Appropriately and comprehensive applying implementation frameworks is one of the key challenges in implementation science resulting in increased use of multiple implementation frameworks within projects. This is particularly true for frameworks such as PARIHS/i-PARIHS. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to examine if and why the PARIHS/i-PARIHS framework has been applied in research with other implementation frameworks. Methods We searched six databases from 2016 (the year following i-PARIHS’ publication) to April 2024 and supplemented this with a citation search of the seminal i-PARIHS paper. We included studies that 1) were peer-reviewed with a protocol or empirical study design, 2) have applied the PARIHS or i-PARIHS framework for implementation planning, delivery, analysis, or evaluation and 3) also used at least one other implementation framework. Descriptive statistics were conducted to report on study characteristics and frequency for each implementation framework used with PARIHS/i-PARIHS. A qualitative, content analysis was used to analyse the answers to open-ended extraction questions. Results Thirty-six articles met criteria for inclusion and included 16 protocols and 20 empirical articles (twelve intervention and eight cross-sectional studies). Thirty-four of the studies used one additional implementation framework and two studies used two additional implementation frameworks. In total, nine implementation frameworks were applied with PARIHS/i-PARIHS, including: 1) RE-AIM, 2) CFIR, 3) NPT, 4) REP, 5) TDF, 6), DSF, 7) KTA, 8) Stetler’s Model, and 9) SIF. Thirty-four reported a rationale for using PARIHS/i-PARIHS and 34 reported a rationale for using the other implementation framework. Only eleven reported a rationale for using more than one implementation framework. Only three reported strengths of combining implementation frameworks. Conclusions Overall, this review identified that implementation researchers are using PARIHS/i-PARIHS in combination with other implementation frameworks and providing little to no rationale for why. Use of multiple implementation frameworks without detailed rationales compromises our ability to evaluate mechanisms of effectiveness. Implementation researchers and practitioners need to be more explicit about their framework selection, detailing the complementary strengths of the frameworks that are being used in combination, including why using one is not sufficient.

87e6c331bd083a44530573f5da62f7aff01d32f9,Global Prevalence of Neospora caninum in Domestic Pigs (Sus domesticus) and Wild Boars (Sus scrofa): A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis,"ABSTRACT Background Neospora caninum (Apicomplexa, Sarcocystidae) is a protozoan parasite regarded as a major cause of reproductive failure in cattle. Swine are susceptible to N. caninum infection; however, the role of these animals in the circulation, maintenance, and transmission of N. caninum remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the global seroprevalence of N. caninum in domestic pigs (Sus domesticus) and wild boars (Sus scrofa). Methods Online databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to identify relevant studies up to 30 April 2024. A random‐effects meta‐analysis model was used to estimate the overall and subgroup‐pooled prevalence of N. caninum across studies. The Cochrane test (Q) and the I 2 index were employed to heterogeneity. Funnel plots and Egger's regression test were used to evaluate publication bias, year of publication, and sample size. Results A total of 11,124 animals from 26 eligible studies were included. The pooled seroprevalence of N. caninum in swine was 17% (95% CI: 7%–26%) with a prevalence of 17% in domestic pigs and 16% in wild boars. In the subgroup analysis, the highest prevalence was observed among female animals, with a pooled seroprevalence of 17% (95% CI: 7%–26%). The pooled seroprevalence of N. caninum was nearly equal in adult and sub‐adult swine (18% and 14%, respectively). The overall seroprevalence of N. caninum in swine, based on sample size and year of publication, showed no statistically significant correlations. Conclusion The present study showed that domestic swine are suitable intermediate hosts of N. caninum based on serological findings. However, further studies are needed to describe the epidemiology of the N. caninum and to isolate the parasite from swine to confirm this hypothesis.",Veterinary Medicine and Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11721471, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

979a19576f5c29b63011276d05687918e05451fc,Could less be enough: sublobar resection vs lobectomy for clinical stage IA non-small cell lung cancer patients with visceral pleural invasion or spread through air spaces.,"BACKGROUND
While recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that sublobar resection is non-inferior to lobectomy, the comparative efficacy of these procedures remains uncertain for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; ≤ 3 cm) exhibiting invasive features postoperatively, such as visceral pleural invasion (VPI) or spread through air spaces (STAS).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
To identify eligible studies, a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted through 25 July 2024. Studies were screened according to predefined criteria in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The primary endpoints were 5-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to perform a meta-analysis.


RESULTS
The final analysis included 14 retrospective studies and 1 randomized controlled trial, encompassing a total of 8,054 patients with NSCLC (tumors ≤3 cm) exhibiting VPI or STAS. The meta-analysis revealed that sublobar resection was associated with impaired 5-year OS (HR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.10-1.41) and slightly inferior RFS (HR: 1.25; 95% CI: 0.99-1.58) compared to lobectomy for pT2a (VPI) NSCLC patients with tumor ≤3 cm. Similarly, sublobar resection was associated with significantly worse 5-year OS (HR: 2.58; 95% CI: 1.92-3.45) and 5-year RFS (HR: 2.42; 95% CI: 1.69-3.46) compared to lobectomy for stage IA NSCLC patients with STAS. Subgroup analysis revealed that statistically significant differences in 5-year OS (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.92-1.38) and 5-year RFS (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.56-1.36) were not observed between the sublobar resection and lobectomy groups for pT2a (VPI) NSCLC patients with tumor ≤2 cm. Additionally, no statistically significant survival difference was observed between the segmentectomy and lobectomy groups for NSCLC patients (≤3 cm) with VPI (5-year OS: HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.89-1.52; 5-year RFS: HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.88-1.30) or STAS (5-year OS: HR: 3.88; 95% CI: 0.82-18.31; 5-year RFS: HR: 1.64; 95% CI: 0.70-3.80).


CONCLUSION
For early-stage (≤3 cm) NSCLC with VPI or STAS, sublobar resection was associated with worse survival outcomes compared to lobectomy. However, segmentectomy achieved survival outcomes comparable to those of lobectomy. For pT2a (VPI) NSCLC patients with tumor ≤2 cm, the differences in survival outcomes between sublobar resection and lobectomy were not statistically significant.",International Journal of Surgery,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1097/js9.0000000000002249', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1097/JS9.0000000000002249?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1097/JS9.0000000000002249, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Parapharyngeal space liposarcomas (PPS-LS) are rare tumors often associated with a moderate-to-poor prognosis.


OBJECTIVES
This study aims to assess tumor control and survival outcomes across the various subtypes of PPS-LS.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
We conducted a systematic review of cases using PubMed, OVID, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and EBSCO from inception to October 2024. Given the data on individual patient follow-up, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was utilized to calculate disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS).


RESULTS
Out of 303 articles, 10 studies with 11 patients (72.7% male) met the inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 51.3 years (range: 12-77.5). Preoperative fine needle aspiration cytology was conducted in 45.4%, with 80% yielding inconclusive results. The 2-year and 5-year DFS rates for PPS-LS were 64% and 50%, respectively, while the 2-year DSS rate was 84%. Tumor recurrence occurred in 36.3% of patients, with an average of 2.5 recurrences per patient, specifically the myxoid subtype of PPS-LS.


CONCLUSION
This systematic review highlights the varied prognostic outcomes of PPS-LS and its subtypes, emphasizing the need for vigilant surveillance to improve DFS and reduce recurrence rates.

249ea6d9b3a051a19a450cd5ec3412e271f72381,Behavioural and Social Drivers (BeSD) of HPV vaccination in Zimbabwe: A Rapid Scoping Review of Literature.,"BACKGROUND
Regardless of the World Health Organization's recommendation for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, Zimbabwe still faces challenges in achieving optimal vaccination coverage among female adolescents and young adults.


OBJECTIVES
This rapid scoping review of literature aims to identify the behavioural and social drivers (BeSD) influencing HPV vaccination uptake in Zimbabwe over the past ten-year period.


METHODS
A scoping review of published and grey literature from 2014 to 2024 was conducted. Data analysis was guided by theoretical frameworks.


ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
 English language published and grey literature relevant to public health, vaccination, and social and behavioural sciences from Zimbabwe from 2014 to 2024.


SOURCES OF EVIDENCE
Ministry of Health & Child Care archives, African Journals Online, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science.


CHARTING METHODS
Tables with author information, year of publication, and relevant findings were used to chart the results.


RESULTS
Twenty-eight articles and grey literature sources were included. Key themes encompassed knowledge and attitudes, costs, vaccine uptake, healthcare provider perspectives, and feasibility of delivery methods. High knowledge levels regarding HPV and vaccination coexisted with misinformation and fears, impacting uptake. Socioeconomic factors and religious beliefs influenced HPV vaccination decisions. School-based vaccination was deemed feasible but faced challenges such as misinformation. Communication strategies, including a ""Communication for Development"" (C4D) approach, were crucial for addressing barriers and fostering community engagement.


DISCUSSION
The findings align with numerous theoretical frameworks including the Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behaviour, and Social Ecological Model. Addressing barriers at multiple levels, promoting cultural competence, and integrating HPV vaccination into existing healthcare activities are recommended.


CONCLUSION
To enhance HPV vaccination uptake in Zimbabwe, tailored health literacy campaigns, leveraging existing healthcare infrastructure, increased political commitment, and integration into national immunization programmes are crucial. Implementation should draw on existing policies and guidelines to ensure sustainability and equity in vaccination efforts.",Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31557/APJCP.2025.26.3.775?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31557/APJCP.2025.26.3.775, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study presents a case of CHE and an updated systematic review of previously reported cases, providing insights into recurrence patterns and survival outcomes. Methods: A comprehensive electronic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science up to 31 December 2024, to identify eligible case reports. Kaplan–Meier curves were used to estimate event-free survival. Results: We report a 61-year-old man with a splenic lesion associated with weight loss and abdominal pain persisting for 1 year. Intraoperative findings revealed an enlarged spleen and multiple hepatic deposits. Splenectomy and liver biopsy revealed a well-demarcated, nodular tumor measuring 160 × 145 × 100 mm, with histological and immunohistochemical findings consistent with CHE, complicated by hepatic metastasis. Of 405 potentially eligible studies, 59 were included in the review, covering cases from 2000 to 2024, with a peak in 2020 and 2023. The median age of patients was 42 years, with the most common tumor sites being the lower extremities (30.48%), followed by the face, head, and neck (20.95%), and upper extremities (18.1%). Surgical intervention was the most common treatment (60.95%). Recurrence-free survival was observed in 42.86% of cases, while 15.24% experienced recurrence with or without metastasis. Two patients (1.90%) died from the disease. The median recurrence-free survival was 48 months (95% CI: 7.3–88.7). Conclusions: CHE exhibits significant morphological variation and can mimic other vascular tumors. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for proper prognosis and avoiding overtreatment due to misdiagnosis as more aggressive neoplasms. Patients with high-risk CHE should undergo closer surveillance to ensure timely detection of progression.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/jcm14082541?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082541, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While there are many different responses of permafrost thaw (Ward Jones, 2024), one of the most impressive consequences is thaw subsidence (lowering or collapse of the land surface) when permafrost is ice-rich. Farmers-collaborators participating in the Permafrost Grown Project, a $3 million, five-year (2022- 2027) transdisciplinary project based at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and funded by the US National Science Foundation, have described various ways thaw subsidence impacts their agricultural fields and practices. This includes changing surface topography, changing surface water flow patterns, killing crops, and abandoning whole or parts of fields.

Even with repair, patients are likely to develop osteoarthritis (OA) within the next two decades. There is a pressing clinical need to improve meniscal repair procedures to restore tissue function and prevent joint degeneration later in life. Here we present a review of recently published articles (2020-2024) spanning basic science, translational, and clinical studies to highlight new advances in meniscus research across development, animal models, finite element models, and clinical interventions. Key progenitor cell populations and vascularity changes have been identified in human meniscus tissue development, aging, and degeneration with implications for novel tissue repair strategies. The use of animal and finite element models has expanded our understanding of meniscus tissue function and evaluated new therapies in preclinical studies. Further, advances in clinical diagnostics with machine learning models and surgical techniques have shed light on evidence-based practices for improving patient outcomes. We discuss across multiple length scales (micro-, meso-, macro-) the structure-function relationship of the meniscus in development and disease, recent advances in models and tools to study the meniscus, knowledge gaps in the field, persisting challenges in clinical treatments and assessments, and the translation of basic science therapies into the clinic.",Journal of Orthopaedic Research,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/jor.26066?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/jor.26066, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

cbbf1417a78c72646d13afa63518606a241d9f62,Recreational Use of Nitrous Oxide as a Source of Frostbite Injuries to the Skin: A Review of the Literature and a Case Report,"Nitrous oxide has a wide range of medical applications, such as being used as an analgesic in general anesthesia, dental procedures, childbirth and sedation. Lately, it has also been employed as an inhalant recreational drug to induce brief euphoria. Recent studies indicate a worldwide rise in the incidence of skin frostbites associated with nitrous oxide use. A scoping review was conducted to synthesize and summarize the existing literature published in English regarding frostbite injuries associated with the recreational use of nitrous oxide. The literature search was carried out in July 2024 using databases such as Embase, Web of Science and PubMed®. From an initial pool of 83 publications, 8 studies were ultimately selected for full-text review as they met our inclusion criteria for analysis. Additionally, we provide a representative clinical case involving a 21-year-old male who experienced frostbite following skin exposure to nitrous oxide. Most publications on nitrous oxide induced frostbites are from recent years, primarily between 2022 and 2024, with the first case documented in 1996. These injuries are mostly observed in young adults, with a female dominance, and are typically localized to the inner thighs. According to the existing literature, the predominant treatment approach is conservative management, with excision and split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) in the second place. This study represents the first literature review summarizing frostbite injuries to the skin from nitrous oxide misuse. There is a need for enhanced preventive measures to raise public awareness and reduce the incidence of frostbite injuries associated with the recreational use of nitrous oxide.",European burn journal,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3390/ebj6010014', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11941200, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6f2ff91bee5ec72079bcaf67b769863bb5b9cc5e,Global characteristics of pancreatic cancer survival: a comprehensive overview of survival analysis from cancer registration data,"
 
 Incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer have either remained stable or increased slightly in many countries. The 5-year relative survival rate for pancreatic cancer is the lowest among 25 common cancers. This study focuses on the survival situation, variations and trends of pancreatic cancer worldwide.
 
 
 
 This comprehensive overview searched 6 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, SEER, CNKI and SinoMed) for all articles published before January 1st, 2024. Survival estimates from the final included literature were extracted and compared.
 
 
 
 The 99 included studies showed that changes in pancreatic cancer survival over the past 30 years were less than ideal. We found no significant improvement in 5-year relative survival from pancreatic cancer in most countries over the past three decades. The age-standardized 1-year relative survival rates were mostly distributed between 10% and 20% during 1972 to 2020, and with the highest survival rate being 34.7% in the USA during 2009 to 2014. The age-standardized 5-year relative survival rates were below 10% in most regions in the same period. Younger pancreatic cancer patients also had higher survival rates.
 
 
 
 Over the past 30 years, the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer has not improved significantly worldwide, and more effective ways to prevent and control pancreatic cancer earlier are needed.

d9975f1ce0dc91309cf84aeafd9a2cd91e09e798,Insights into the Technological Evolution and Research Trends of Mobile Health: Bibliometric Analysis,"Background/Objectives: Smartphones, with their widespread popularity and diverse apps, have become essential in our daily lives, and ongoing advancements in information technology have unlocked their significant potential in healthcare. Our goal is to identify the future research directions of mobile health (mHealth) by examining its research trends and emerging hotspots. Methods: This study collected mHealth-related literature published between 2005 and 2024 from the Web of Science database. We conducted a descriptive statistic of the annual publication count and categorized the data by authors and institutions. In addition, we developed visualization maps to display the frequency of keyword co-occurrences. Furthermore, overlay visualizations were created to showcase the average publication year of specific keywords, helping to track the changing trends in mHealth research over time. Results: Between 2005 and 2024, a total of 6093 research papers related to mHealth were published. The data have revealed a rapid increase in the number of publications since 2011. However, it was found that research on mHealth has reached a saturation point since 2021. The University of California was the dominant force in mHealth research, with 248 articles. The University of California, the University of London, Harvard University, and Duke University are actively collaborating, which shows a geographical pattern of collaboration. From the analysis of keyword co-occurrence and timeline, the research focus has gradually shifted from solely mHealth technologies to exploring how new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) in mobile apps, can actively intervene in patient conditions, including breast cancer, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. Privacy protection policies and transparency mechanisms have emerged as an active research focus in current mHealth development. Notably, cutting-edge technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and virtual reality (VR) are being increasingly integrated into mHealth systems. These technological convergences are likely to constitute key research priorities in the field, particularly in addressing security vulnerabilities while enhancing service scalability. Conclusions: Although the volume of core research in mobile health (mHealth) is gradually declining, its practical applications continue to expand across diverse domains, increasingly integrating with multiple emerging technologies. It is believed that mobile health still holds enormous potential.",Healthcare,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/healthcare13070740?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare13070740, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To undertake the endeavor, every article published in each of seven selected top journals in the field has been classified according to a pre-specified list of one hundred keywords. Three keywords selected from the list were assigned to each article, given the subjects they cover and the methods of analysis they employ. The proposed exercise reveals a widely diversified science, which touches every aspect of human decision-making and human interaction, at every imaginable scale and regardless of geography. It is also a science that looks at the past to understand the future, and a body of knowledge capable of reinventing itself in the face of the evolution of society. Much more than before, economics deals today with such themes as income inequality, climate change, healthcare, education, and gender and race issues; while maintaining a close look at traditional micro and macro topics, such as market competition or business fluctuations. Methodologically, a gradual revolution has taken place, with natural experiments progressively becoming a fundamental tool of economic inquiry.

1ecc201f774fc3189f7e5a7efa8e272cee97350a,Strengthening Evidence-Based Practice in Malaysia: Improving the Public CPR Awareness Time Model for Self- Vital Monitoring,"Cardiac arrest is a significant global health issue, with over 20,000 paediatric cases annually in the United States (AHA, 2020), and in Malaysia, coronary heart disease affects approximately 29,363 individuals each year, contributing heavily to national health concerns (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2021). To address this challenge, this study aims to strengthen evidence-based practice (EBP) in Malaysia through the integration of the TIME model (Transform, Innovate, Model, Enhancement) for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) public awareness for vital selfcare monitoring, particularly focusing on pulse monitoring and perfusion index (PI) as essential components of patient care. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, this research is grounded in the American Nurses Association’s (ANA, 2024) EBP model. The primary objectives of the study are: (1) to assess the factors influencing the implementation of various CPR practices and public health monitoring awareness, (2) to analyse the relationship between CPR approaches and public health monitoring awareness through statistical regression analysis, and (3) to develop an EBP practice guide for strategic CPR awareness. A comprehensive literature review utilizing databases such as OUM e-library, Science Direct, AHA, and ResearchGate provided insights from over 150 relevant sources. A mixed-methods design was applied, including quantitative data from surveys and qualitative data from open-ended questionnaires, with a sample of 200 final-year nursing students. Findings will inform the development of a recommended EBP model enhancement and strategic CPR guidelines, culminating in an eBook for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) public awareness for vital selfcare monitoring 2025-2030. The TIME model’s application in this context serves as a transformative and innovative framework that fosters best practices in CPR training and enhances public health awareness, on collaboration, patient-centred care, and the sustainability of health outcomes in Malaysia. focusing of Pulse Self-Monitoring for Public Awareness and CPR Readiness in Malaysia.",International journal of research and innovation in social science,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47772/ijriss.2025.9020194?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2025.9020194, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2e3570dcf9827a97d440ae26cd50402fc11e9b8a,"Carbon Reduction of the Three-Year Air Pollution Control Plan under the LEAP Model Using a GREAT Tool in Panzhihua, China","In the context of global warming and climate change, various international communities have set different reduction targets for carbon emissions. In 2020, China proposed that CO2 emissions will peak by 2030 and reached a critical period in which carbon reduction is a key strategic direction. Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences published the “Panzhihua Three-Year Iron Fist Gas Control Action Plan” in 2021. The measures implemented in the plan only address general considerations of conventional pollutants in the atmosphere. This study established the Panzhihua LEAP model based on the GREAT tool and built four simulation scenarios, including pollutant treatment upgrade (PTU), traffic improvement (TI), boiler remediation (BR), and baseline scenarios for industrial sources, mobile sources, and industrial boilers in policy implementation. It provided a supportive basis for the development of environmental protection measures in Sichuan province to increase the efficiency of carbon emission reduction. The quantitative analysis of the simulation results for the five years from 2020 to 2024 was conducted to discuss the intrinsic links between carbon emissions and energy consumption, market storage, and demand under different scenarios. It concluded that the BR and TI scenarios benefit carbon reduction, while the PTU scenario negatively impacts it. This study provided recommendations for analyzing the carbon footprint at a city-wide level, quantifying the relationship between the implementation of relevant environmental measures and carbon emissions, which are available for policy development that incorporates carbon reduction considerations and offers relevant support for future research.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/21/14482/pdf?version=1667568634', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655107, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

39b9e546c0cde2a2279d389f98977466f9aa0ee3,Welcoming More Participation in Open Data Science for the Oceans.,"Open science is a global movement happening across all research fields. Enabled by technology and the open web, it builds on years of efforts by individuals, grassroots organizations, institutions, and agencies. The goal is to share knowledge and broaden participation in science, from early ideation to making research outputs openly accessible to all (open access). With an emphasis on transparency and collaboration, the open science movement dovetails with efforts to increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science and society. The US Biden-Harris Administration and many other US government agencies have declared 2023 the Year of Open Science, providing a great opportunity to boost participation in open science for the oceans. For researchers day-to-day, open science is a critical piece of modern analytical workflows with increasing amounts of data. Therefore, we focus this article on open data science-the tooling and people enabling reproducible, transparent, inclusive practices for data-intensive research-and its intersection with the marine sciences. We discuss the state of various dimensions of open science and argue that technical advancements have outpaced our field's culture change to incorporate them. Increasing inclusivity and technical skill building are interlinked and must be prioritized within the marine science community to find collaborative solutions for responding to climate change and other threats to marine biodiversity and society.

Although the field of marine ecological predictions is still in its infancy, it is understood that a major source of multi-year predictability resides in the ocean. Here we show the first highly skilful long-term predictions of the commercially valuable Barents Sea cod stock. The 7-year predictions are based on the propagation of ocean temperature anomalies from the subpolar North Atlantic toward the Barents Sea, and the strong co-variability between these temperature anomalies and the cod stock. Retrospective predictions for the period 1957–2017 capture well multi-year to decadal variations in cod stock biomass, with cross-validated explained variance of over 60%. For lead times longer than one year the statistical long-term predictions show more skill than operational short-term predictions used in fisheries management and lagged persistence forecasts. Our results thus demonstrate the potential for ecosystem-based fisheries management, which could enable strategic planning on longer time scales.

This study aimed to predict academic boredom among medical students based on their perceptions of classroom goal structure and task value.
Methods: This is a cross-sectional correlational study. The statistical population included all medical students at Kashan University of Medical Sciences during the year 2024, from which 435 students were selected through stratified random sampling. Participants completed Midgley’s Perceived Classroom Goal Structure Questionnaire, Pintrich’s Task Value Scale, Pekrun’s Academic Boredom Questionnaire, Li’s Trait Boredom Scale, and a demographic questionnaire form. Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis.
Results: The results showed that after controlling for the effects of age, gender, and students' trait boredom, the variables of task value (β=-0.270, P<0.001) and mastery-oriented goal structure (β=-0.239, P<0.001) were negatively and significantly associated with academic boredom, while performance-avoidance goal structure (β=0.111, P=0.029) was positively and significantly particioated academic boredom in students. Overall, 32.3% of the variance in students' academic boredom was explained by the model.
Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that a mastery-oriented classroom goal structure and students' perceptions of intrinsic task value can help reduce academic boredom. In contrast, a performance-avoidance goal structure may increase academic boredom. These findings emphasize the importance of implementing educational strategies that highlight the intrinsic value of tasks and promote mastery goals rather than focusing on competition and failure avoidance, thereby contributing to reducing academic boredom and enhancing the educational experience of medical students.",Researches in Medical Education,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32592/rmegums.17.1.13?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32592/rmegums.17.1.13, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The paper describes sanctions imposed by a number of unfriendly countries, namely, the refusal to cooperate inmany spheres, including the economy, science, and education. The article considers initial measures to neutralize sanctions. In particular, Russia proposed to create educational «hubs» in the Asia-Paciﬁc region based on the association of the leading universities and scientiﬁc institutions for the training of a skilled workforce to implement priority directions of the development of the economy in Russia and the countries of South-East Asia, taking into account their relevance in the real economy sector. The paper analyses issues of integration of science, higher education, and industry, which contributes to the increase of eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of research, quality of education, and training of scientiﬁc and technical personnel, as well as the inﬂow of youth in the research and development sphere.The author outlines the directions for the development of the global information/digital society concerning the demand for new digital technologies, which, year after year, are being revised, updated, and improved. High emphasis is placed on the processes of digital transformation, which have a widespread inﬂuence on scientiﬁc activities, so much so that 2022–2031 were proclaimed as the Decade of Science and Technology.

b4deee7036d4970726c84f0aceedd6e45944369f,Linking citation and retraction data reveals the demographics of scientific retractions among highly cited authors,"Retractions are becoming increasingly common but still account for a small minority of published papers. It would be useful to generate databases where the presence of retractions can be linked to impact metrics of each scientist. We have thus incorporated retraction data in an updated Scopus-based database of highly cited scientists (top 2% in each scientific subfield according to a composite citation indicator). Using data from the Retraction Watch database (RWDB), retraction records were linked to Scopus citation data. Of 55,237 items in RWDB as of August 15, 2024, we excluded non-retractions, retractions clearly not due to any author error, retractions where the paper had been republished, and items not linkable to Scopus records. Eventually, 39,468 eligible retractions were linked to Scopus. Among 217,097 top-cited scientists in career-long impact and 223,152 in single recent year (2023) impact, 7,083 (3.3%) and 8,747 (4.0%), respectively, had at least 1 retraction. Scientists with retracted publications had younger publication age, higher self-citation rates, and larger publication volume than those without any retracted publications. Retractions were more common in the life sciences and rare or nonexistent in several other disciplines. In several developing countries, very high proportions of top-cited scientists had retractions (highest in Senegal (66.7%), Ecuador (28.6%), and Pakistan (27.8%) in career-long citation impact lists). Variability in retraction rates across fields and countries suggests differences in research practices, scrutiny, and ease of retraction. Addition of retraction data enhances the granularity of top-cited scientists’ profiles, aiding in responsible research evaluation. However, caution is needed when interpreting retractions, as they do not always signify misconduct; further analysis on a case-by-case basis is essential. The database should hopefully provide a resource for meta-research and deeper insights into scientific practices.",PLoS Biology,2025.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11781634, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a2a3e65fec7730d1ad2ca9fc721acb8341f954ba,Role of Community Infrastructure in Improving Nutri- tion in Under-five Children,"Background: In India, 26 million children are born every year. These children (0-6 years) comprise 13% of the country’s population. Undernutrition is a fallout of malnutrition, malabsorption, and nutritional imbalance which causes a problem of being underweight in children. It can affect a child’s brain development and other developmental milestones. This study is designed to understand the role of Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) (community day-care centres) and women’s access to internet in reducing the undernutrition in children. Methods: It was a retrospective cross-sectional study which was conducted during 2023-2024. The study population consisted of 724,115 Indian women in the age group of 15-49 years. We used anonymized, publicly available secondary data from the India National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5). The NFHS5 survey was carried out from the year 2019 to 2021. Information on various parameters was collected using a predesigned questionnaire. Statistical analysis including Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, simple linear regression and multiple linear regression analysis were carried out for independent variables including percent of operational AWCs and percent of women with internet access, and dependent variable (percent of underweight children per state). Statistical analysis of the data has been done by social science statistics tools. The significance level of 0.05 was considered for analysis. Results: The states or union territories (UTs) with lower number of AWCs had a higher percentage of women with Internet access as compared to UTs with more AWCs. Multiple linear regression for independent variables (operational AWCs, and women with internet access), and dependent variable (underweight children per state) was developed. It was shown that β0=37.1607; β1 (AWCs)=0.5659; and β2 (internet access)=-0.2907 and R squared value as 0.5709. This shows that independent variables have a significant influence on the number of underweight children in the state. Results of the Pearson correlation indicated that there is a significant large negative relationship between women’s access to Internet and the percentage of underweight children in the state, (r (34)=-0.733, P<0.001), meaning that with an increase in internet access for women the percentage of underweight children decreases. Conclusion: The study clearly shows that when compared, community daycare centers (AWCs) have a limited role in the child’s nutrition, but women’s Internet access can be a determinant of the child’s nutrition. Women’s access to the Internet can help reduce the number of underweight children under five and improve overall maternal and child health as well as public health.",Journal of Client-centered Nursing Care,2025.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32598/jccnc.11.1.605?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32598/jccnc.11.1.605, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study therefore assessed the effectiveness and safety of aspirin compared with oral anticoagulants (OACs) for VTE prophylaxis after joint arthroplasty. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by searching PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to May 14, 2024, that compared the effect of aspirin versus OACs on VTE prophylaxis in adults undergoing joint arthroplasty. Data extraction followed the PRISMA guidelines. Two independent researchers conducted the literature searches and data extraction. A random-effects model was used to estimate effects. The primary outcome was the incidence of VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE); secondary outcomes included bleeding, wound complications, and mortality. Results: The meta-analysis included 11 RCTs with a total of 4,717 participants (55.1% female) from several continents. The relative risk (RR) of VTE following joint arthroplasty was 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93 to 1.32) for aspirin compared with OACs. Similar results were observed for DVT (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.40) and PE (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.51 to 2.71). There were no significant differences in the risks of bleeding, wound complications, or mortality between patients receiving aspirin and those receiving OACs. Subgroup analyses considering factors such as study region, type of joint surgery, type of VTE detection, year of publication, use of mechanical VTE prophylaxis, aspirin dose, type of OAC comparator, study quality, and funding also found no significant differences in VTE incidence between aspirin and OACs. The overall quality of evidence for VTE and DVT outcomes was high. Conclusions: Based on high-quality evidence from RCTs, aspirin is as effective and safe as OACs in preventing VTE, including DVT and PE, after joint arthroplasty, without increasing complications.

3b70cb93c5bca66510266317961ac9ebb3fc53f3,Prevalence and risk factors for long COVID among cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective The prevalence of long COVID among cancer patients remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of long COVID and explore potential risk factors among cancer patients. Methods A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase from database inception until 21 March 2024, to identify studies that reported long COVID in cancer patients. Two investigators independently screened the studies and extracted all information about long COVID in cancer patients for subsequent analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using the “Joannagen Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data”. Results A total of 13 studies involving 6,653 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of long COVID was 23.52% [95% confidence interval (CI), 12.14% to 40.64%] among cancer patients reported experiencing long COVID after acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The pooled prevalence of any long COVID in cancer patients was 20.51% (95% CI, 15.91% to 26.03%), 15.79% (95% CI, 11.39% to 21.47%), and 12.54% (95% CI, 6.38% to 23.18%) in 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up duration. Fatigue was the most common symptom, followed by respiratory symptoms, myalgia, and sleep disturbance. Patients with comorbidities had a significantly higher risk of experiencing long COVID [odds ratio (OR) = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.70; p = 0.019]. No statistically significant differences in sex, primary tumor, or tumor stage were detected. Conclusion Nearly a quarter of cancer patients will experience long COVID after surviving from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this would even last for 1 year or longer. Fatigue, respiratory symptoms, myalgia, and sleep disturbance need to be more addressed and managed to reduce symptom burden on cancer patients and improve quality of life. Patients with comorbidities are at a high risk of developing long COVID.

174a0d807aba5846e47605bd7d6b7f416b5b871c,Revolutionizing Education in the Rural Elementary School: Leveraging Instructional Automation and Interactive Assessment,"Abstract
Aim: Transformation in education includes integrating artificial intelligence, enhancing teaching competencies, and administrating administrative tasks that require highly skilled and competent teachers to utilize technological tools in the classroom and save more time from other administrative work. This study aimed to assess the readiness of revolutionizing education, the level of instructional automation, and the extent of assessment measures utilized in rural elementary schools and their significant interconnectedness by looking at the perspectives of teachers and learners. 
Methodology: The study employed a descriptive evaluative design and correlational research design; utilizing a researcher-made questionnaire. The study was conducted among 129 teachers and 220 learners in 13 elementary schools of North President Quirino District for the school year 2024-2025. The data were analyzed using mean and standard deviation, Pearson correlation coefficient and One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
Results: The data reveals that both teachers and learners are highly ready to revolutionize education, with an overall mean of 3.76 for teachers and 4.08 for learners. A strong level of instructional leverage among teachers and learners with overall mean of 4.00 for teachers and 3.97 for learners. For the extent of assessment measures utilized in North President Quirino District findings show an overall mean of 3.93 for teachers and 4.14 for learners, both interpreted as high extent. Furthermore, there is a strong positive correlation (r) of 0.688 for teachers and a very strong positive correlation with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.874 for the learners between revolutionizing education and leveraging instructional automation. A very strong positive correlation between revolutionizing education and interactive assessment , as indicated on the correlation coefficient of (r) 0.888 for teachers and (r) 0.691 for the learners. Moreover, there is a significant difference on teachers and learners’ response on revolutionizing education with an f-value of 1.644 and a p-value of .042; f-value of 1.836 and a p-value of .015 for instructional automation; and an f-value of 2.499 and a p-value of 0.001. 
Conclusion: The study findings reveal that rural elementary schools exhibit moderate to high readiness for educational transformation, particularly through AI integration, enhanced teaching competencies, and automated administrative tasks. Strengths lie in strategic planning and professional development, though resource allocation and collaboration with tech firms remain challenges. Instructional automation improves efficiency in teaching and administration but raises concerns about reduced teacher-learner interactions, highlighting the need for a balanced approach. Assessment methods remain diverse, with pen-and-paper tests complemented by computer-aided, game-based, and practical exams, the latter excelling in real-world application. A strong positive relationship exists between education reform, instructional automation, and interactive assessments. However, a gap in perception between teachers and learners highlights the need for better training and collaboration to ensure shared ownership of educational advancements.

Methodology: This qualitative study was conducted in 2024 at BMC, Quetta, to examine gender inequity in MBBS and BDS admissions from 2019 to 2024. Thirty-two first-year female students from the 2024 batch were purposively selected for focus group discussions (FGDs) to explore their personal experiences regarding gender-specific challenges. The themes that emerged were safety concerns, transportation issues, cultural norms and social pressures, lack of female role models, and family support. In addition, the study examined the availability and accessibility of MDCAT preparation resources, specifically for students from rural backgrounds, who reported more challenges in accessing coaching and educational materials.
Results: The five-year data analysis revealed persistent gender inequity, with female admissions consistently lower than male admissions. In MBBS, female admissions ranged from 39.2% (n=89/227) in 2019-2020 to 30.62% (n=105/343) in 2023-2024, while female enrollment in BDS remained relatively equal, at 61.36% (n=27/44) in 2019-2020 and 52.27% (n=23/47) in 2023-2024. Among the surveyed students, 37.5% (n=15) reported encountering barriers in pursuing health sciences. The primary obstacles identified were safety concerns and transportation issues at academic institutions (47.5%, n=19), followed by cultural norms and social pressures (20%, n=8), and a lack of female role models in college (12.5%, n=5). While most participants identified inadequate family support and limited access to MDCAT preparation as the primary obstacles, they found educational resources and coaching centers to be generally sufficient. However, a subset of students from rural areas reported restricted access.
Conclusion: There was a persistent gender inequity in MBBS and BDS admissions in BMC with female students facing considerable challenges both pre and post-admission.

Methods To achieve this, data were collected from 237 undergraduate students at a four-year university in Incheon, South Korea, from October 7 to November 7, 2024. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were conducted using SPSS 29.0, and PROCESS macro 4.2 was applied to analyze mediation and moderation effects. 
Results First, the results showed that communication skills significantly influenced critical thinking disposition, which in turn significantly impacted AI literacy. While the direct effect of communication skills on AI literacy was not significant, the indirect effect through critical thinking disposition was significant, confirming the full mediating role of critical thinking disposition. Second, the academic major moderated the relationship between communication skills and AI literacy. For students in engineering and science majors, communication skills had the strongest impact on AI literacy, whereas students in humanities and social sciences showed a moderate level of influence. In contrast, students in arts and physical education majors demonstrated a relatively weaker but still significant influence.

4f42249d8f50173e2712ee892df9299522a9408c,TRENDS IN USE OF RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TESTS,"INTRODUCTION: Laboratory diagnostics worldwide is changing daily. Digitizing it by introducing sensors and new rapid diagnostic tests plays an important role in protecting public health. There is still a lack of widespread use of these types of sensors and tests in Bulgaria.
The aim of this study was to establish the level of awareness and frequency of use of rapid tests.
MATERIALS: The study used a documentary method comprising a systematic review of scientific publications from medical journals published in electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, etc. in the studied field. Sociological methods were used by anonymous survey among 980 respondents to explore the opinion of users of rapid tests and sensors for laboratory parameters. The study covers the period October 2018 - February 2019 and November - December 2024. MS Office Excel package and ANOVA statistical method were used for data processing. RESULTS: We investigated the use of rapid tests and devices for determination of laboratory indices, and found that the predominant users of monthly tests were 73.5%, only 1-2 times a year occupying a relative share of 16.3%, and the users who self-tested weekly were 10.2%.
The survey data showed the largest difference in the use of rapid tests for influenza (2018-2019 3.20%/2024 jumped to 25%) and COVID (2018-2019 3.20%/2024 jumped to 32%) followed by tests used for glucose testing and glucometer and sensor supplies. Pregnancy test use also increased to 23.3%, other tests roughly maintained their use over the studied period. CONCLUSION: Globally, the consumption of sensors and rapid diagnostic tests is a growing trend due to the dynamics of viral diseases, aging population and centralization of healthcare. The use of rapid diagnostic tests in Bulgaria is projected to continue to increase, especially in the context of greater availability of technology and in response to pandemic or epidemic threats. Rapid diagnostics are expected to become more prevalent not only in hospitals and healthcare settings, but also in other public and corporate spheres as part of efforts to prevent the spread of disease and improve public health.",Trakia Journal of Sciences,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.15547/tjs.2025.01.005', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15547/tjs.2025.01.005?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15547/tjs.2025.01.005, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

willingness to donate blood and their understanding of their own blood type and rhesus factors are
essential. Knowing a student's blood group is crucial since it allows them to donate blood in an
emergency. The current study aims to ascertain college students' distribution of ABO blood and rhesus
groups, as well as to boost their desire to donate blood by increasing their knowledge with their blood
group.
Methods: In March 2024, 231 students from Bhavan's Tripura College of Science and Technology in
west Tripura, ages 19 to 22 years, participated in this cross-sectional survey. ABO type results and the
Rh factor were included to the self-administrated questionnaire that was used to gather the data. All the
data was analysed by excel and SPSS software.
Results: The most frequent blood types among the students in this study were found to be group B (33.76
%) and O (31.16%), followed by group A (29.87 %). While 5.19 percent of students are Rh negative, the
bulk of students about 94.80 percent, belong to the Rh-positive factor. The majority of students (91.34%)
accurately identified their Rh factor and ABO blood group when we asked them, and we compared their
answers with the test results. Boys who have donated blood in the past are more likely to disclose their
blood type than others. Merely 53.67 % of the entire study population expressed interest in donating
blood in the upcoming year. Male donors have a more positive attitude about blood donation than
female donors. At the same time, girls are also far less inclined to donate blood.
Conclusion: The research population exhibited a higher frequency of blood type B, O, and Rh positive.
Although the majority of college students are well-informed about their blood type, less than half of them
expressed interest in donating blood. Therefore, encouraging young college students to donate blood is
our primary goal.",Medicine and Clinical Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.33425/2690-5191.1140', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33425/2690-5191.1140?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33425/2690-5191.1140, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, the durability of SCS therapy, including explantation rates, remains a concern. Understanding explantation causes is essential for improving patient selection and device effectiveness. This study aims to analyze SCS explantation rates and reasons, as well as evaluate the financial burden of these procedures on the healthcare system. Methods Three primary screening methods were used: manual search with keywords, MeSH term query, and reference list screening. The search covered PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases from inception to November 2024, yielding 719 articles. After applying eligibility criteria, 72 articles were identified, and 25 were selected for analysis. Data extraction was done by independent reviewers, with a second reviewer ensuring accuracy. Discrepancies were resolved by the corresponding editor. Results We reviewed data from 13,026 patients who underwent permanent SCS implantation between 1984 and 2024, across 25 studies. A total of 1882 patients (9.82%) underwent explantation. The most common reason was lack of efficacy and inadequate pain relief (38%), followed by lead failure (15%) and infection (14%). While SCS is generally effective, issues related to device longevity and patient satisfaction persist, with explantation rates due to technical failures and lack of efficacy being concerns. Conclusion SCS efficacy varies, with explantation rates reaching up to 38%, often due to inadequate pain relief. Most explantations occur within the first year, despite SCS being a safe and effective treatment. High implantation costs ($35,000 to $70,000) and revision costs ($15,000 to $25,000) raise concerns among payors. The hardware-driven model limits waveform flexibility, highlighting the need for innovation.",Journal of Pain Research,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11929510, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

47b962bfb259d158419d8e35e38a5a6bd7b10911,Comprehensive Global Analysis of Future Trends in Artificial Intelligence‐Assisted Veterinary Medicine,"ABSTRACT Background This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of global trends in ‘artificial intelligence studies in veterinary medicine’. The analysis aims to summarise the publications of researchers from various disciplines related to artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine, thereby predicting future trends of AI in this field. The primary objective of the study is to investigate publications pertaining to artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine worldwide and to analyse trends and future developments in this area. Methods This bibliometric study examines artificial intelligence research in veterinary medicine conducted worldwide from 1990 to 2024. To achieve this, a search using the keywords ‘artificial intelligence’ and ‘veterinary medicine’ was performed in the Web of Science (WOS) database, resulting in the identification of 1497 studies. After excluding irrelevant publications and those outside the scope of articles, a total of 1400 articles were included in the analysis. The data collection process utilised titles, author names, publication years, journal names, and citation counts. All textual data were analysed using VOSviewer software to ensure accuracy and reliability. In this study, analyses conducted through text mining and data visualisation techniques (e.g., bubble maps) facilitated a clearer understanding of the results. Results This study presents information about 1400 articles obtained from the WOS database and a total of 44,700 citations for these articles. The average number of citations per article is 32, with an H‐index of 74. A rapid increase in both the number of articles and citations has been observed since 2019. The majority of the articles (30%) were published in the fields of veterinary sciences, artificial intelligence, and computer sciences. The United States, Taiwan and the United Kingdom are the leading countries, accounting for 84% of the published articles in this field. Additionally, 12% of the articles were published in the area of veterinary sciences, and 85% of the articles fall within the SCI‐Expanded category. Conclusions The findings of our study indicate that there are numerous active researchers in the field of artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine and that research in this area is steadily increasing. This bibliometric analysis highlights global trends and significant works in artificial intelligence within veterinary medicine, providing valuable insights into the future directions of research in this field. As the analysis aims solely to identify trends and patterns in the literature, it does not intend to evaluate the applicability of the subject matter. Highlights Analysis of Global Trends: This study comprehensively analyses the global trends and effects of research on artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine. In this context, it contributes to the identification of significant changes and developments in the literature. Rapidly Spreading Research: Research on artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine has rapidly expanded in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue.

311e7f625e25c182ae867f9fab7ee2f25ff6c419,Impact of Diagnosis to Ablation Time on Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation and Clinical Outcomes After Catheter Ablation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis With Reconstructed Time-to-Event Data.,"BACKGROUND
Current clinical guidelines emphasize the significance of rhythm control with catheter ablation but lack guidance on the timing of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation relative to the diagnosis time. We aim to investigate the latest evidence on the impact of diagnosis to ablation time (DAT) on clinical outcomes after AF ablation.


METHODS
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through August 2024. Pairwise, prognostic, and reconstructed time-to-event data meta-analyses were conducted using R V. 4.3.1. Our primary end point was time to first AF recurrence, with secondary end points of all-cause mortality, tamponade, stroke, and heart failure.


RESULTS
Our cohort included 23 studies with 43 711 patients. Shorter DAT was significantly associated with reduced AF recurrence across both paroxysmal and persistent AF subgroups (P<0.01). There was a significant decrease in benefit for paroxysmal AF over time and a slight decrease in benefit for persistent AF over time. However, the benefit remained significant in both over time. DAT per year was significantly associated with a 10% increased risk of AF recurrence. Reconstructed Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that DAT >1 year was significantly associated with a 70% increased risk of AF recurrence in paroxysmal AF and 30% in persistent AF. DAT ≤1 year was significantly associated with decreased all-cause mortality (P<0.01) and showed a trend toward an association with a lower incidence of stroke (P=0.08). However, there was no significant difference in heart failure between DAT ≤1 year and DAT >1 year.


CONCLUSIONS
Early ablation is more beneficial in paroxysmal AF, with a notable decrease in benefit over time, while in persistent AF, the benefit remains significant but slightly decreases over time. Shorter DAT was significantly associated with decreased all-cause mortality and showed a trend toward an association with a lower incidence of stroke.

c8a98af74e7e29649a7e05d2ae151d35939ee223,Development and science perspectives of the POLAR-2 instrument: a large scale GRB polarimeter,"Despite several decades of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger spectral observations, GammaRay Bursts (GRBs) remain one of the big mysteries of modern astrophysics. Polarization measurements are essential to gain a more clear and complete picture of the emission processes at work in these extremely powerful transient events. In this regard, a first generation of dedicated W-ray polarimeters, POLAR and GAP, were launched into space in the last decade. After 6 months of operation, the POLAR mission detected 55 GRBs, among which 14 have been analyzed in detail, reporting a low polarization degree and a hint of a temporal evolution of the polarization angle. Starting early 2024 and based on the legacy of the POLAR results, the POLAR-2 instrument will aim to provide a catalog of high quality measurements of the energy and temporal evolution of the GRB polarization thanks to its large and efficient polarimeter. Several spectrometer modules will additionally allow to perform joint spectral and polarization analyzes. The mission is foreseen to make high precision polarization measurements of about 50 GRBs every year on board of the China Space Station (CSS). The technical design of the polarimeter modules will be discussed in detail, as well as the expected scientific performances based on the first results of the developed prototype modules.",International Conference on Rebooting Computing,2021.0,19,"{'url': 'https://pos.sissa.it/395/580/pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02978, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

An instance could depict how life events and control are somehow the effects of exerted control igniting success or neither a lack of control reflecting a failure outcome. Research has shown that control in learning situations encourages competency of individuals and that representations of pleasant personality and behavior, especially in academic settings. This study aimed to examine how academic locus of control and language behavioral attitudes could affect the L2 Academic Performance of the AB-ELS students at the College of Arts and Sciences, Isabela State University Echague Campus on English Language Learning. A descriptive correlational study was employed to determine the profile of the respondents. Where 90 ELS respondents at S.Y 2023-2024 are measured through a stratified random sampling design. Printed Questionnaires were utilized to gather data on academic locus of control and language behavioral attitudes. On the other hand, frequency, percentage, mean score, and Pearson correlation coefficient were considered to analyze the data. Results showed that the majority of the ELS respondents have an internal locus of control and positive language behavioral attitude influencing an L2 academic performance.

4f0c675b0a0eb1b78ec8243a7de496a9ddf66db7,ASSOCIATION OF HUSBAND SUPPORT AND POSTPARTUM BLUES IN POSTPARTUM WOMEN : SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,"Background: Postpartum women have a number of difficulties in the early postpartum phase if they are not given social assistance. Programs for postpartum education are necessary to support postpartum women's mental health. 
Aims: This systematic review is to review the association of husband supports and the cases of postpartum blues in postpartum women. 
Methods: By comparing itself to the standards set by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020, this study was able to show that it met all of the requirements. So, the experts were able to make sure that the study was as up-to-date as it was possible to be. For this search approach, publications that came out between 2014 and 2024 were taken into account. Several different online reference sources, like Pubmed, ScienceDirect and SagePub, were used to do this. It was decided not to take into account review pieces, works that had already been published, or works that were only half done. 
Result: In the PubMed database, the results of our search brought up 350 articles, whereas the results of our search on SAGEPUB brought up 4759 articles, our search on SCIENCE DIRECT brought up 7069 articles. The results of the search conducted for the last year of 2014 yielded a total 16 articles for PubMed, 1354 articles for SAGEPUB and 2516 articles for SCIENCE DIRECT. In the end, we compiled a total of 6 papers, 2 of which came from PubMed, 1 of which came from SAGEPUB and 3 of which came from SCIENCE DIRECT. We included six research that met the criteria. 
Conclusion: In summary, there is association of husband supports and the cases of postpartum blues in postpartum women. Husband involvement in prenatal care seems to be able to reduce the incidence of postpartum blues but may possibly increase the couples’ intimacy. Therefore, it can be suggested that midwives consider husband involvement in prenatal care.",Journal of advanced research in Medical and Health science,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.61841/c2ws8x39?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.61841/c2ws8x39, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

From the end of 2020 until at least 2024 the STS/ATS is expanding to Scotland and Wales to include all constituent nations in Great Britain. Expanding data collection to Scotland and Wales will permit the evaluation of how smoking and alcohol related behaviours respond to divergent policy scenarios across the devolved nations. Methods The STS/ATS consists of monthly cross-sectional household interviews (computer or telephone assisted) of representative samples of adults in Great Britain aged 16+ years. Commencing in October 2020 each month a new sample of approximately 1700 adults in England, 450 adults in Scotland and 300 adults in Wales complete the survey (~n = 29,400 per year). The expansion of the survey to Scotland and Wales has been funded for the collection of at least 48 waves of data across four years. The data collected cover a broad range of smoking and alcohol-related parameters (including but not limited to smoking status, cigarette/nicotine dependence, route to quit smoking, prevalence and frequency of hazardous drinking, attempts and motivation to reduce alcohol consumption, help sought and motives for attempts to reduce alcohol intake) and socio-demographic characteristics (including but not limited to age, gender, region, socio-economic position) and will be reviewed monthly and refined in response to evolving policy needs and public interests.

In January 1975, the inaugural issue of the Journal was published (read it here: www.sjweh.fi/issue/274). We are delighted that 50 years later not only are we still around, but we have retained our special position in the science publication business as an independent journal that is not owned by a commercial publishing house. We are grateful that our not-for-profit publisher, the Nordic Association of Occupational Safety and Health (NOROSH), has ensured this independence. And we are proud to belong to a community of authors, reviewers, editors, international advisory board members, and, of course, readers that is committed to research excellence and has carried this journal for now half a century. Thank you!
 We want to celebrate our anniversary by looking both back and ahead. In each issue of 2024, we will include an invited 50-year-anniversary article, authored by leading researchers in the field. In this first issue, we take a look at ourselves, reflecting on work environment exposures and health outcomes that have emerged as well as those that have vanished from the pages in the Journal. And we take a look at those papers that have generated the greatest interest among our readers (1).
 In the coming year, various authors will take a look at the research field, that is, they will discuss specific work environment conditions and health outcomes. This will include exposures as diverse as asbestos and the psychosocial work environment and outcomes such as musculoskeletal disorders and occupational cancers. We will in particular examine the successes and failures with regard to these exposures and outcomes. Has occupational health research made a difference? Are there success stories where our research has helped to protect and improve workers’ health and thereby contributed to a better population health? Did we provide solid evidence on health hazardous, health-protecting, and health enhancing working conditions and did this result in changes at the workplace? Or did we fail? Was our research not good enough to provide sufficient evidence for action? Or was our research good enough but action still did not happen? And what can we do in the future to improve? How can we do research better and thus make a difference in society?
 We are looking forward to the answers to these questions in the anniversary-related papers, which are incidently not yet written, so we do not know what they will tell us. Our guess is, though, that there are no easy answers and a lot of work still remains ahead of us. We and others have recently argued in a Discussion Paper series on “Work and Health” in The Lancet that “major gains in population health and reductions in health disparities can be made by an increased focus on improving the work environment.” (2). However, as we also argue in the series, there is still a long way to go in realizing the potential that good work has for better population health (2–4). 
 Our objective with 50-year SJWEH anniversary series is that, by the end of the year, the occupational health community will have become more knowledgeable about what went well and not so well in our research field and that we feel confident where to go next. To engage the community further in this discussion, we are planning a half-day in-person and online symposium on 4 October 2024. We are still working on the exact format and content of the symposium. Please stay tuned on LinkedIn and follow the updates in our newsletter.

Increased resources and career development will increase recruitment and address barriers to their promotion and success. Methods/Study Population: In 2019, the Medical School Dean committed to fund 15 Early Career Research Awards (ECRA) Scholars to recruit outstanding new-to-UMN, tenure track faculty. Supplementing usual departmental recruitment packages, ECRA Scholars receive: 75% salary and fringe benefit support for 3 years; an additional $500,000 of research funds; and augmented mentoring and coaching with required participation in the relevant CTSI career development program. Department Chairs propose meritorious candidates for Review Committee consideration based on the Chair nomination letter, scientific plan, mentoring plan, CV, and additional letters of recommendation. To foster community building, there is an annual mini-retreat for the ECRA Scholars and other underrepresented CTSI Scholars with an external visiting professor. Results/Anticipated Results: Fifteen tenure-track faculty have been recruited as ECRA Scholars since 2019 into 9 different departments. One additional Scholar has been accepted and three have completed the program. Three ECRA Scholars were K awardees at the time of recruitment. The CTSI career development programs utilized were the K Accelerator (10), KL2 Scholar (2), and K-R01 (5) Programs, with 3 involved in two programs. The Scholar degrees include 10 PhDs, 3 MD/PhDs, and 2 MDs, with additional MPH/MS (5), MSW (1), and DPT (1) degrees. ECRA Scholars have been awarded multiple NIH R21, Foundation, and internal grants currently under review include Ks and R01s with 5 additional K, 2 new R01, and 1 revised R01 submissions planned for the 2024–2025 academic year. Discussion/Significance of Impact: The ECRA program has successfully augmented recruitment of outstanding underrepresented research-oriented early-stage faculty to the University of Minnesota School of Medicine, contributing to many Departments. The CTSI has provided career development, networking, and a broader community of Scholars, with increased diversity in CTSI programs.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.841', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/cts.2024.841?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.841, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To identify the most effective treatment modality for achieving favorable outcomes in early glottic tumors with anterior commissure involvement (ACI).


DATA SOURCES
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect.


REVIEW METHODS
Random-effects proportional meta-analysis model is used to evaluate the oncological and functional outcomes of transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) versus radiation therapy (RT) in early glottic (T1-T2) cancer with ACI.


RESULTS
From a total of 736 studies, 40 studies were included, comprising 2666 early glottic tumor patients with ACI. TLM (52%) and upfront RT (48%) were the primary treatment groups. TLM had better 5-year overall survival (OS) (84.5% [80.3%-88.0%] vs. 79.4% [75.7%-82.7%]). Similarly, TLM-treated patients had better 3-year pooled disease-free survival (DFS) compared with RT-treated patients (82.7% [77.1%-87.1%] vs. 73.3% [23.8%-96.0%]). TLM exhibited a better 5-year local control rate (LCR) than RT (77.2% vs. 71.6%). In our temporal analysis, TLM had a higher 5-year LCR than RT (78.2% vs. 63.5%) in 2001-2012, with similar rates in 2013-2024 (76.8% vs. 78.4%). TLM-treated patients had higher laryngeal preservation rates compared with RT patients (93% [90.6%-94.8%] vs. 87.6% [82.8%-91.2%]).


CONCLUSIONS
Our meta-analysis is the first in the literature to compare the outcomes between TLM and RT-treated patients with ACI in early glottic tumors. TLM-treated patients appear to have superior 5-year OS and laryngeal preservation compared with upfront RT-treated patients. However, both TLM and RT exhibited comparable oncological outcomes in early glottic tumor patients with ACI during the recent period from 2013 to 2024.

33bd27ed73cfe81f09f2afc886da5832acab9d9f,The Lucy Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (L’LORRI),"NASA’s Lucy mission spacecraft was launched on 16 October 2021 and will perform the initial in situ investigation of the Jovian Trojan asteroids (Levison et al. 2021 , 2024 ). The Lucy LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (L’LORRI) is a panchromatic visible light (420–795 nm, 50% QE points), narrow-angle (field of view = 0.29°), high spatial resolution (1.0^′′ pixel^−1) imager used on the Lucy mission for both science observations and optical navigation. L’LORRI is designed to provide maps of the sunlit portions of the Trojan surfaces to a resolution of ∼10 m (after deconvolution), which will enable crater counting to constrain the surface ages. L’LORRI’s high sensitivity and large dynamic range permits imaging of the low albedo Trojans at moderately large phase angles (down to I/F values of ∼0.0014 with SNR ≈ 30 using an exposure time of 100 ms), as well as providing early acquisitions of the Trojans during the approach phase, searches for Trojan activity that are ∼10× better than can be obtained from Earth, and deep searches for potential Trojan satellites down to V ≈ 20.4 $V \approx 20.4$ at spatial resolutions far surpassing that available from Earth. This paper describes the L’LORRI instrument design and the requirements that drove the design. We present results from L’LORRI’s ground calibration campaign, summarize the L’LORRI in-flight calibration plan, and describe typical L’LORRI operations scenarios during the Trojan flybys. We also present an analysis of in-flight data taken during the first year of Lucy operations, which show that most aspects of L’LORRI’s performance are nominal (i.e., as predicted), but the telescope’s point spread function is slightly degraded relative to pre-flight predictions. Nevertheless, L’LORRI is still expected to fulfill all of its scientific objectives, which should revolutionize our view of the Jovian Trojans.",Space Science Reviews,2023.0,8,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11214-023-01028-z.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s11214-023-01028-z?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-023-01028-z, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f1005d544a8b22e8d21ed372bc4a11d277515b88,The Global Turbidity Current Pump and Its Implications for Organic Carbon Cycling.,"Submarine turbidity currents form the largest sediment accumulations on Earth, raising the question of their role in global carbon cycles. It was previously inferred that terrestrial organic carbon was primarily incinerated on shelves and that most turbidity current systems are presently inactive. Turbidity currents were thus not considered in global carbon cycles, and the burial efficiency of global terrestrial organic carbon was considered low to moderate (∼10-44%). However, recent work has shown that burial of terrestrial organic carbon by turbidity currents is highly efficient (>60-100%) in a range of settings and that flows occur more frequently than once thought, although they were far more active at sea-level lowstands. This leads to revised global estimates for mass flux (∼62-90 Mt C/year) and burial efficiency (∼31-45%) of terrestrial organic carbon in marine sediments. Greatly increased burial fluxes during sea-level lowstands are also likely underestimated; thus, organic carbon cycling by turbidity currents could play a role in long-term changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate.

The advancement of Internet technology has led to the proliferation of accessible online news media, which has overwhelmed people’s lives. Online news platforms have developed personalised recommendation systems to help readers avoid information overload and enhance their experience. However, the filter bubble, one of the side effects of personalised news recommendations, has received severe criticism for limiting readers’ perspectives. Media bias, which is one of the factors causing the “filter bubble” phenomenon, is widely present in news media. It has been extensively studied in the field of social sciences due to its unconscious distortion of readers’ views. Although many studies have focused on examining the effect of media bias on users and their political choices, there is still a lack of direct research on the impact of media bias on news dissemination platforms, such as personalised news recommender systems. My PhD research project aims to explore the influence of media bias on news recommender systems, and understand the factors that accelerate the recommendation of biased news to readers. To help algorithm designers gain insight into the sensitivity of proposed recommendation algorithms to media bias, and to design debiasing algorithms to weaken the impact of media bias on news recommender systems.","User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization",2023.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3565472.3595619?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3565472.3595619, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The (C), opportunity (O), and motivation (M) as three key factors capable of changing behavior (B) (ie, COM-B) model of behavioral change conceptualizes how capabilities, opportunities and motivations combine to cause behavior. 4 Using this model, we designed a study to help develop educational videos for the public — specifically, whiteboard animation videos. These animations are a visually engaging way of presenting complex information, including health topics. Whiteboard animations about healthcare have gained hundreds of millions of views, and there is evidence that they have improved patient understanding of a number of topics. 5 We studied 2 key areas of public behavior: reducing consumption of unnecessary antibiotics and drinking enough fluids daily to help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs).

fdedc023c34655eab9f07c553d22a3baf07d6e60,Critical review of AMR risks arising as a consequence of using biocides and certain heavy metals in food animal production,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the resistance of a microorganism to an antimicrobial agent (a substance that kills or stops the growth of microorganisms) that was originally effective for treatment of infections caused by it. As a result standard antimicrobial drug treatments may become ineffective, lead to infections persisting, increasing the risk of spread to others, and negative clinical outcomes. AMR is a major public health issue worldwide and it is estimated that unless action is taken to tackle AMR, the global impact of AMR could be 10 million deaths annually from drug-resistant infections by 2050 and cost up to US $100 trillion in terms of cumulative lost global production (O’Neill, 2016). Addressing the public health threat posed by AMR is a national strategic priority for the UK and led to the Government publishing both a 20-year vision of AMR (Opens in a new window) and a 5-year (2019 to 2024) AMR National Action Plan (NAP) (Opens in a new window), which sets out actions to slow the development and spread of AMR. Intensive food animal production plays an important role in the development and spread of AMR and is one of many routes by which consumers can be exposed to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. This review was carried out to help increase our understanding of whether, and to what extent, the use of biocides (disinfectants and sanitisers) and heavy metals (used in feed and other uses) in animal production leads to the development and spread of AMR within the food chain (a subject highlighted in the NAP). Whether this could potentially lead to greater consumer exposure to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria present in our food, either directly through consumption of foods derived from animals that have undergone treatment (for example from the use of heavy metals in animal feed) or indirectly (for example from exposure of crops to contaminated soil or ground water) is not known.

fdedc023c34655eab9f07c553d22a3baf07d6e60,Critical review of AMR risks arising as a consequence of using biocides and certain heavy metals in food animal production,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the resistance of a microorganism to an antimicrobial agent (a substance that kills or stops the growth of microorganisms) that was originally effective for treatment of infections caused by it. As a result standard antimicrobial drug treatments may become ineffective, lead to infections persisting, increasing the risk of spread to others, and negative clinical outcomes. AMR is a major public health issue worldwide and it is estimated that unless action is taken to tackle AMR, the global impact of AMR could be 10 million deaths annually from drug-resistant infections by 2050 and cost up to US $100 trillion in terms of cumulative lost global production (O’Neill, 2016).

4af8ec09880bcd9178a0eff41500d7e844d5304c,APPLICATION OF THE TREFFINGER MODEL TO IMPROVE LEARNING OUTCOMES IN SCIENCE LESSONS,"This research aims to determine the effect of implementing the video-assisted treffinger model on energy material changing the form of science learning at SDN 3 MEREMBU. From the results of observations of the material, changes in shape are relatively low. To overcome this, a video-assisted Treffinger learning model was applied. The research method used is quantitative, the research design is Pre-Experimental Design type one group pretest-posttest Design. This research was conducted on one experimental class group which was not randomly selected. From this research, it can be seen that there has been an increase in the average, namely from 58.17 (pretest) to 70.33 (posttest). The results of the normality test on energy changes learning outcomes obtained a pretest and posttest significance value of 0.063<0.065 so the data was said to be normally distributed. Meanwhile, the output results of the paired sample T test show a sig value. (2-tailed) of 0.000. Based on the basis of decision making on the paired sample T test if sig. (2-tailed) < 0.05 then H0 is rejected and Ha is accepted. In the data above the sig value. (2-tailed) of 0.000 < 0.05 indicates a better effect. In the interpretation table, the R square coefficient of 0.80-1.000 is included in the very strong category so it can be concluded that the video-assisted Treffinger model has a very strong influence on learning outcomes for class 4 science energy changes material. subjects at SDN 3 Merembu Bengkel for the 2023/2024 academic year",CAHAYA: Journal of Research on Science Education,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.70115/cahaya.v1i2.43?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.70115/cahaya.v1i2.43, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To improve learning outcomes, teachers need to make efforts to use teaching aids as media. This research uses a PTK approach which goes through 4 stages, including planning, and implementation. observation and reflection. The research was carried out through 2 cycles where the results of the research showed that the average score for students in the first cycle was an average class score of 60.5 and 7 students who reached the KKM out of 20 students were categorized as still, it could not be said to have met the minimum completeness criteria, this was because Due to non-optimal learning activities, only 30% were completed, so it was necessary to carry out learning in cycle II. The final results showed that in cycle II with an average class score of 80.5 or 17 students had reached the KKM. Of the 20 students, they were categorized as reaching 85 % completed. Therefore, it can be concluded that there has been an increase in science learning outcomes at UPTD SDN 016547 Teluk Dalam, Teluk Dalam District, Asahan Regency for the 2023/2024 academic year using the experimental method using teaching aids.

Euclid’s instruments, a visible imager (VIS) and an infrared spectrometer and photometer (NISP) have both been designed and built by Euclid Consortium teams. The NISP instrument will hold a large focal plane array of 16 near-infrared H2RG detectors, which are key elements to the performance of the NISP, and therefore to the science return of the mission.Euclid NISP H2RG flight detectors have been individually and thoroughly characterized at Centre de Physique des Particules de Marseille (CPPM) during a whole year with a view to producing a reference database of performance pixel maps. Analyses have been ongoing and have shown the relevance of taking into account spatial variations in deriving performance parameters. This paper will concentrate on interpixel capacitance (IPC) and conversion gain. First, per pixel IPC coefficient maps will be derived thanks to single pixel reset (SPR) measurements and a new IPC correction method will be defined and validated. Then, the paper will look into correlation effects of IPC and their impact on the derivation of per super-pixel IPC-free conversion gain maps.

2e4fbf76b605fa254190ec969307f4efb90e1ea6,The Contribution of Submarine Optical Fiber Telecom Cables to the Monitoring of Earthquakes and Tsunamis in the NE Atlantic,"Recent developments in optical fiber cable technology allows the use of existing and future submarine telecommunication cables to provide seismic and sea-level information. In this work we study the impact of three different technologies, 1) SMART, Science Monitoring and Reliable Telecommunications; 2) DAS, Distributed Acoustic Sensing, and; 3) LI, Laser Interferometry, for effective earthquake and tsunami monitoring capabilities on the NE Atlantic. The SW Iberia is the source area of the largest destructive earthquake that struck Europe since the year 1000, the November 1, 1755 event. This earthquake generated also a destructive tsunami affecting the whole basin. This tectonically active area is crossed by the CAM (Continent-Azores-Madeira) submarine cable on a ring configuration. Due to the end of cable lifetime the current cables need to be replaced by 2024 and the technical requirements must be defined in mid-2021. The Azores archipelago is the focus of frequent seismic crizes and occasionally destructive earthquakes. A common feature of these seismic events is that they take place offshore, an area that is difficult to monitor from land-based instruments. In this work we evaluate the contribution of SMART cables to the earthquake monitoring and tsunami early warning system in SW Iberia and show how DAS and LI can improve earthquake monitoring on two active domains of the Azores. For tsunami early warning, we show how the offshore sea-level measurements provide clean offshore tsunami records when compared to coastal observations by tide gauges, which greatly improves the efficiency of the system. For earthquake monitoring, the data processing operational routine is examined using Monte-Carlo simulations. These take into consideration the errors in phase picking and the uncertainty on the 1D velocity model used for earthquake location. Quality of earthquake location is examined using the difference between the true location and the centroid of the computed epicenters and by the overall ellipse of uncertainty obtained from 100 runs. The added value provided by instrumented submarine telecommunication cables to mitigate earthquake and tsunami risk demonstrated in this work will help authorities and the society in general to take the political decisions required for its full implementation worldwide.",Frontiers in Earth Science,2021.0,13,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2021.686296/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/feart.2021.686296?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.686296, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In the fall of 2020, newly matriculated medical students around the country started medical school in a remote learning setting. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic on academic performance and student satisfaction among first-year medical students. Methods The newest cohort of first-year medical students (class of 2024; n = 128) who completed their first basic science course, ""Genes, Molecules & Cells (GMC),"" using an adapted remote format was compared to the prior year's cohort (class of 2023; n = 122) of first-year medical students who were taught using traditional approaches. The items that were compared were numerical performance on exams and quizzes, study strategies, and course evaluation in GMC. Data were analyzed with a two-sided t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient. Students' perception of remote learning was also reported and results were obtained using a five-point Likert scale through anonymous surveys via E-value. Results No statistical difference was observed in students' performance on the midterm and final examinations between the two cohorts in both multiple-choice and written examinations. Mean multiple-choice question (MCQ) midterm students' performance in remote learning compared to traditional learning cohort was 75.9%, standard deviation (SD) 6.1 to 75.89%, SD 6.49, respectively. Mean MCQ final students' performance was 84%, SD 6.37 (class of 2024) to 85%, SD 8.78 (class of 2023). Students’ satisfaction with their learning experience was similar among the two groups (class of 2024: mean = 4.61, SD 0.66; class of 2023: mean = 4.57, SD 0.68). Most students (70%) in the remote learning cohort had a positive opinion of remote learning. Of the students, 17% reported feeling disconnected, isolated, or not actively involved. Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate that not only is remote learning effective but that the students were also resilient in their adaptation to a new learning format. Our experience highlights the importance of including wellness solutions to mitigate the feeling of isolation and disconnection during remote learning.",Cureus,2021.0,10,"{'url': 'https://www.cureus.com/articles/62561-remote-learning-and-its-impact-on-newly-matriculated-medical-students.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8442805, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8599acd6ff84d9ab2764c19fda3a055b02cf7d78,Generation Victoria (GenV): protocol for a longitudinal birth cohort of Victorian children and their parents,"Background In a world confronted with new and connected challenges, novel strategies are needed to help children and adults achieve their full potential, to predict, prevent and treat disease, and to achieve equity in services and outcomes. Australia’s Generation Victoria (GenV) cohorts are designed for multi-pronged discovery (what could improve outcomes?) and intervention research (what actually works, how much and for whom?). Here, we describe the key features of its protocol. Methods GenV is a whole-population longitudinal platform open to all ≈150,000 children born within a two-year window and residing in the state of Victoria and their parents. GenV is guided by its 6 principles of Inclusivity, Collaboration, Sustainability, Enhancement, Systematised Processes and Value and enabled by large-scale biobanking, IT and novel high-throughput technology infrastructure. Successive recruitment phases were designed to maximise GenV’s inclusivity: (1) a smaller Advance Cohort from December 2020; (2) Newborn recruitment, with presence in 58 Victorian maternity services supporting face-to-face approach to parents of babies born 4 October 2021–3 October 2023; (3) Intensive remote recruitment to mid-2024 targeting those missed around birth; and (4) Ongoing indefinite enrolment of in-age children and their parents. Participants consent to universal (1) data linkage (e.g., state and federal physical and mental health, education, social, geospatial, ecological); (2) biosamples storage and use (e.g., residual clinical pregnancy and newborn screening, GenV-collected perinatal parent/infant saliva); (3) phenotypic and biosamples collection waves at child ages 6, 11 and 16 years, likely in schools and remotely for parents; and (4) opportunities for collaborative research integrated into GenV as a population registry (e.g., trials, natural experiments, depth subcohorts). Many participants supplement universal data with additional biosamples (e.g., infant stool, breast milk) and brief digital remote ‘GenV and Me’ assessments over the first 5 years. GenV will make all research data available, adhering to the principles of Open Science. Discussion Launched in the COVID-19 pandemic and committed to diversity and inclusivity, GenV’s parallel consented child and pre-midlife cohorts will be positioned to help address today’s pressing issues such as chronic mental and physical health conditions, inequity, public health crises such as pandemics, and climate harm.

b4210b0308d83ff45eab9b4d740c46169c255306,ICT-Based Game: An Alternative to Promote Healthy Eating in Ecuadorian Children Using User-Centred Design,"Inadequate nutrition in Ecuadorian children leads to various physical, cognitive, and biological issues. However, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) has become established in raising awareness and promoting beneficial eating behaviours. This research, conducted at the Indo-America Educational Unit during the 2022-2023 academic year in Ambato, Ecuador, aimed to compare the effectiveness of a guide text versus a didactic game in enhancing knowledge about healthy eating among fifth-grade students in Natural Sciences. The study involved 87 fifth-grade students, divided into two groups: Group 1, consisting of 42 students, and Group 2, consisting of 45 students. The teacher of Group 1 used traditional methods (reading and writing from the text), while the teacher of Group 2 employed a game called Flavour Puzzle. Statistical analysis revealed significant improvements in knowledge and motivation for students using the game-based method. Specifically, students in Group 2 showed a 26% greater improvement in knowledge levels compared to those in Group 1, and their motivation levels were nearly three times higher (89% vs. 30%). The results indicate that the game-based method has a clear comparative advantage over traditional text-based instruction, as it not only facilitated teaching but also enhanced socialization and engagement among students. Technological resources like Flavour Puzzle are more engaging for students and should be utilized as both recreational and educational tools in teaching Natural Sciences at the school level.

In 2018, the number of devices connected to the Internet exceeded the number of human beings and this increasing trend will see about 80 billion devices by 2024. Securing these devices and the data passing between them is a challenging task because the number of IBAs is also increasing sharply year by year. To address this issue, a large number of defences against network attacks have been proposed in the literature. Despite all the efforts made by researchers in the community over the last two decades, the network security problem is not completely solved. In general, defence against network attacks consists of preparation, detection and reaction phases. The core element of a good defence system is an IOT Botnet Attack (IBA) Detection System (IBA-DS), which provides proper attack detection before any reaction. An IBA-DS aims to detect IBAs before they seriously damage the network. The term IBA refers to any unauthorised attempt to access the elements of a network with the aim of making the system unreliable.","International Journal of Advanced Research in Science, Communication and Technology",2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.48175/ijarsct-3700', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.48175/ijarsct-3700?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.48175/ijarsct-3700, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8829082756fe7bb8ec45208a604e9f5104678813,Using African Indigenous Languages in Science Engagement to Increase Science Trust,"In 2018, The Wellcome Global Monitor reported that only an average of 15.6% (average calculated from chart 3:1) of the African population have high trust in scientific institutions and scientists (WGM report, 2018). This report (p. 58) cited two primary factors associated with the level of trust of a person in scientists: 1) learning and understanding science at school or college and 2) confidence in key societal institutions (the government, military, and judiciary). In a study interrogating how courtroom linguistic choices impact confidence in the institution of the justice system, Liu and Baird discovered that confidence levels are lowest when only a majority language is used in the courtroom, and that use of either a minority language and/or a lingua franca increases confidence levels in the judicial institution (Liu and Baird, 2012). Examination of both teacher (Alidou et al., 2006; Njoroge, 2011; Kibirige and Mogofe, 2021; Semeon and Mutekwe, 2021) and student performances (Prophet and Dow, 1994; Rollnick and Rutherford, 1996; Manzini, 2000; Mwinsheikhe, 2002; Brock Utne, 2004; Mammino, 2010; Mahlasela, 2012; Charamba 2019) using more familiar languages as opposed to Western languages has consistently shown increased understanding of scientific concepts. Students taught in languages familiar to them also produced better results in exams and there were fewer repeaters (Wilmot, 2003; Bender et al., 2005; Alidou et al., 2006; Kioko et al., 2014). Policies that address the importance of using “understandable” or “familiar languages” to discuss science topics have been proposed in documents like the Lagos Declaration and Call to Action on Science Communication and the Public Learning and Understanding of Science (PLUS), which was produced during the 2nd African Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity in 2016 (African Gong, 2016). This concept is also addressed within “Priority 3” and expanded in chapter six of the 10-year Science, Technology, and Innovation Strategy for African Union (2014) (STISA-2024), which was drafted during the 23rd Ordinary Session of African Union Heads of State and Government Summit in June 2014 (African Union, 2014). Thus, we believe that if we continue to encourage a commitment to promote science and its implications in daily life, culture, and environment (science engagement) in more African indigenous languages (AILs), then understanding, confidence, and ultimately trust in science across large audiences on the African continent will increase.",Frontiers in Communication,2022.0,6,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2021.759069/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/fcomm.2021.759069?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2021.759069, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

COMAT started in 2010. Therefore, we celebrated already 12th anniversary of the conference the last year. The event was organized by traditional tandem COMTES FHT Inc. and TANGER Ltd. We had high expectations for this meeting after two years of COVID restrictions. Unfortunately, many of them remained valid till the conference took place and we had very narrow range of foreigner participants and rather low number of participants in comparison with the previous years. Lower number of participants lead to single session conference, which in turn resulted in very friendly and constrictive atmosphere, when all sessions had much more audience and discussions, than it was in the previous years, when parallel sessions systems was implemented. For COMAT 2022 we agreed for the first time on selected paper publication in Materials journal, leading to smaller amount of papers to be found in these proceedings, but we still hope the readers will find these proceedings interesting and inspiring.

Limited research has been done to explore their association with permanent teeth. Given the caries susceptibility of permanent first molars and their role in the development of ideal occlusion, this study aimed to estimate caries frequency in these molars and assess its association with IDA in 7–12 year-old children. Methods and analysis This analytical cross-sectional study will include 141 children aged 7–12 years visiting physicians in the paediatric OPD of Dr. Ruth K.M. Pfau, Civil Hospital Karachi. Using consecutive sampling, children who met initial screening criteria were further evaluated to determine eligibility for the study. Data collection will involve physical examinations (including weight and height), oral examinations (including the relevant oral hygiene and caries assessments) and laboratory examinations (including the prescribed tests). In addition, questions will be asked about sociodemographic characteristics, history of IDA, oral hygiene habits, smokeless tobacco use and the frequency of cariogenic dietary consumption. Exposure variable will include the presence of IDA, assessed using complete blood count, C-reactive protein and ferritin tests and treated as a dichotomous variable. Outcome variable will include dental caries in at least one permanent first molar, assessed using the Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth index and also treated as a dichotomous variable. Analysis will include Poisson regression with robust variance, reporting prevalence ratios with 95% CIs for the association of IDA and dental caries in the permanent first molars. Frequency of children with carious permanent first molars with 95% CIs will also be reported. Ethics and dissemination This research has been approved by ethical review committee of Aga Khan University (Reference number: 2024-9692-30593) and the institutional review board of Dow University of Health Sciences (IRB Reference: IRB-3556/DUHS/Approval/2024/196) before participant recruitment.

61d5b9a1c20e1272ece2adf8fcd36c033da93024,Machine Learning in Sustainable Agriculture: Systematic Review and Research Perspectives,"Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized resource management in agriculture by analyzing vast amounts of data and creating precise predictive models. Precision agriculture improves agricultural productivity and profitability while reducing costs and environmental impact. However, ML implementation faces challenges such as managing large volumes of data and adequate infrastructure. Despite significant advances in ML applications in sustainable agriculture, there is still a lack of deep and systematic understanding in several areas. Challenges include integrating data sources and adapting models to local conditions. This research aims to identify research trends and key players associated with ML use in sustainable agriculture. A systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA methodology by a bibliometric analysis to capture relevant studies from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The study analyzed the ML literature in sustainable agriculture between 2007 and 2025, identifying 124 articles that meet the criteria for certainty assessment. The findings show a quadratic polynomial growth in the publication of articles on ML in sustainable agriculture, with a notable increase of up to 91% per year. The most productive years were 2024, 2022, and 2023, demonstrating a growing interest in the field. The study highlights the importance of integrating data from multiple sources for improved decision making, soil health monitoring, and understanding the interaction between climate, topography, and soil properties with agricultural land use and crop patterns. Furthermore, ML in sustainable agriculture has evolved from understanding weather data to integrating advanced technologies like the Internet of Things, remote sensing, and smart farming. Finally, the research agenda highlights the need for the deepening and expansion of predominant concepts, such as deep learning and smart farming, to develop more detailed and specialized studies and explore new applications to maximize the benefits of ML in agricultural sustainability.",Agriculture,2025.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/agriculture15040377?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture15040377, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 ) to study the Galactic MSP population and to contribute to global efforts to detect nanohertz gravitational waves with the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). In order to plan for the remainder of the programme and to use the allocated time most efficiently, we have conducted an initial census with the MeerKAT ‘L-band’ receiver of 189 MSPs visible to MeerKAT and here present their dispersion measures, polarisation profiles, polarisation fractions, rotation measures, flux density measurements, spectral indices, and timing potential. As all of these observations are taken with the same instrument (which uses coherent dedispersion, interferometric polarisation calibration techniques, and a uniform flux scale), they present an excellent resource for population studies. We used wideband pulse portraits as timing standards for each MSP and demonstrated that the MeerTime Pulsar Timing Array (MPTA) can already contribute significantly to the IPTA as it currently achieves better than

81230cab01f815f8a3edd8ccf0bcf7db60e29333,Columbia River Treaty 2014/2024 HEC-WAT Innovations for CRT Computes,"In order for a 50,000 event flood risk analysis (FRA) computation to be feasible given the number and complexity of models in the Columbia River Treaty (CRT) 2014/2024 Review compute sequence, features and tools were added and enhanced in the HEC-WAT (Hydrologic Engineering Center's (HEC) Watershed Analysis Tool) software. The features were designed to speed up the simulation compute time as well as ensure that only the appropriate output was saved. Two features are responsible for reducing the simulation time, the Time Window Modification tool and the Skip Flag tool. The Time Window Modification tool provides capabilities for dynamically modifying the time window used by each model in the compute sequence; so that models did not have to use the same simulation time window. An added benefit of the Time Window Modification tool is the ability to find a starting time that meets boundary conditions and at the same time does not cause initial boundary conditions to go unstable. The Skip Flag tool provides an interface for defining thresholds (flow, stage, or other output) that are used to determine when certain models in the compute sequence are skipped. The amount of model files and data generated from a simulation of 50,000 events for the full CRT model could easily overwhelm a computer's storage. Features were added to remove model files at the end of a number of events while providing the flexibility to save specific files by defining the file name or file extension. Output data from the individual models can also be saved or deleted and an option was included to extract scalar values, like the maximum flow, from the individual models. For example, in order to compare CRT modeling alternatives, peak flows from the snowmelt season were evaluated. HEC-WAT was able to extract this maximum flow from output and discard the flow hydrograph for the entire water year.",,2014.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1061/9780784413548.165?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784413548.165, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Victim was kidnapped by the culprit and he demanded to behead victim’s uncle and send the photos. Coaxing and pleading by the family members went futile. Police came into action after launch of complaint and the culprit was nabbed within hours. Proper collection and preservation of evidences (digital and biological) by the investigation authority proved helpful for forensic analysis. Analysis of CCTV footages, mobile call recordings and DNA analysis proved the sequence of events and connected the culprit with the crime. Forensic reports played a pivotal role in delivering justice. The honorable court relying upon the scientific reports, convicted the culprit of the offence and sentenced him to suffer double imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs. 50,000/- and in default, to suffer further imprisonment for one year. The case investigation was awarded “Kendriya Grihmantri Dakshata Padak” for the year 2024 which is considered as the highest award in the field of investigation.",International Journal For Multidisciplinary Research,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.36948/ijfmr.2025.v07i02.38631?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.36948/ijfmr.2025.v07i02.38631, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a01e0995b181dd95f39617cd5ddb77a27f9b6c05,227 Developing a framework for prioritizing evaluation and CQI methods at the University of Cincinnati CTSA Hub (CCTST),"Objectives/Goals: In alignment with the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) UM1, continuous quality improvement (CQI) needs to be integrated into the elements and hub evaluation. As a first step to operationalizing this process, the University of Cincinnati hub (CCTST) evaluation team developed a systematic approach to prioritizing and sequencing tasks for aligning evaluation methods with CQI. Methods/Study Population: A scoring sheet was developed to provide a framework for prioritizing and developing the sequence and timeline for supporting elements in aligning their evaluation methods with CQI. The scoring sheet assessed: 1) impact – defined as the results from completing the task and implementing enhancements; 2) effort – defined as the amount of resources (time, personnel, and materials) needed to complete the tasks; 3) reach – defined as number of individuals (e.g., CTSA employees, members, researchers, trainees, and community members) impacted by the tasks or products of the tasks; 4) urgency – defined as a task that is time-sensitive due to a deadline and has a clear consequence if not completed on time. Each component was assessed using a 3-point scale (e.g., minimal, moderate, and high). Results/Anticipated Results: In Fall 2024, the CCTST evaluation team met with respective elements to collect data on their: 1) need from the evaluation team to support aligning their evaluation methods with CQI, 2) challenges and barriers to improving evaluation and aligning with CQI methods, 3) number of hours per month available to support improving evaluation methods, and 4) current resources to dedicated to conducting an evaluation. Next, the evaluation team will transcribe the data from the meetings and code the data into the scoring sheet for each element. The scoring sheet is anticipated to produce a score that will be used to develop the sequence, timeline, and initial tasks for supporting elements in improving evaluation methods and aligning with CQI over the first year of the UM1. Discussion/Significance of Impact: CTSA hubs’ evaluation teams operating at full capacity may encounter barriers to implementing CQI efforts. This systematic approach – assessing the impact, effort, reach, and urgency to sequence evaluation and CQI alignment – can support evaluation teams by ensuring a balanced workload and optimizing operations for quality improvement.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.877', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/cts.2024.877?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.877, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0f0f82860f85f30216aab6a3ab6fe739459be4b1,57 Implementation of an analytic resource navigation process at an Academic Medical Center,"Objectives/Goals: In 2018, a novel analytic resource navigation process was developed at Duke University to connect potential collaborators, leverage resources, and foster a community of quantitative researchers and scientists. We provide information about how this process works along with guidance for academic medical centers to develop similar initiatives. Methods/Study Population: Quantitative and qualitative scientists with expertise in data science, biostatistics, epidemiology, and related fields play a critical role in data collection, study design, analysis, interpretation, and implementation. The analytic resource navigation process connects researchers with quantitative scientists and relies on strong institutional knowledge of methodological expertise, understanding of research goals, educating researchers, and ongoing evaluation to understand unmet needs. University staff serve as navigators to help researchers identify the needed expertise, find potential collaborators, and track outcomes. Duke University’s tracking system for this navigation process, implemented in 2019, underwent a nearly five-year evaluation (November 2019 – September 2024). Results/Anticipated Results: In the nearly five-year evaluation of the process, 1247 requests from 813 unique researchers were navigated with a success rate of 93.8%. A total of 323 requests (256 unique researchers) were navigated in year 1, 285 requests (239 unique researchers) in year 2, 210 requests (179 unique researchers) in year 3, and 247 requests (192 unique researchers) in year 4. In the current year (partial year 5, 11/1/2023 – 9/18/2024), 182 requests have been navigated (159 unique researchers). Unsuccessful linkages occurred in 35 requests (2.8%) and 42 requests (3.4%) were withdrawn. Among the cases of unsuccessful navigation, 26 failed due to effort (e.g., insufficient effort available to meet the researcher’s deadline), 2 failed due to lack of expertise at the institution, and 4 failed due to a lack of sufficient funding. Discussion/Significance of Impact: The navigation process provides a critical resource for researchers who need to develop collaborations and a method for institutions to understand collaboration needs. Implementation requires training knowledgeable navigators, maintaining updated information about quantitative and qualitative methodologists, and institutional support.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.736', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/cts.2024.736?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.736, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d1643d1ccb1e5b0555340e2acf9356208789b5a0,What is happening in Sweden?,"Sweden has witnessed significant, fast, and sustainable evolution in the optometry profession over the past 3 decades. We recommend a visit to the webpage of Sancta Lucia Gilles for a fantastic compilation of the history of optometry in Sweden — https://www.sanctaluciagille.se/optikeryrkets-historia. In this editorial we share some exciting news about the optometry education and extended responsibilities for optometrists. After about 20 years of solid first-cycle bachelor education, Linnaeus University opened a new master program in optometry and vision sciences in 2021 (Linnaeus University, 2022). From September 2023 the bachelor education at Linnaeus University will be available from Campus Kalmar and Campus Gothenburg. Thatmeans an annual intake of about 75 first-cycle students and up to 25 second-cycle (masters) students per year. With an annual intake of 100 new students Linnaeus University will be a big player in optometry in theNordic countries. In parallel, the responsibilities of Swedish optometrists are expected to be extended by the Swedish authorities. We aim to shed some light on the impact of these developments on optometry education in Sweden and the rest of the Nordic countries. Recognising the evolving healthcare landscape and, probably, appreciating optometrists as a major asset for the chain of eye care, Socialstyrelsen (the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare) is planning to extend optometrists responsibilities. Socialstyrelsen is an agency under the Swedish Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Socialstyrelsen, 2019; 2020) and is responsible for ensuring the quality, accessibility, and equity of healthcare and social services. From January 2024 the main planned changes to the law that controls optometric practice are: (a) optometrists will be allowed to perform eye exams and prescribe refractive correction to children of any age (currently Swedish optometrists cannot prescribe to children under the age of 8 years), (b) the text “optometrists cannot touch the eye” will be removed from the law, and (c) the “contact lens license” will cease to exist as a speciality, that is, all optometrists will be licensed to work with contact lenses. In addition, despite it not being mentioned in the law, the current consensus amongst all eye care professionals is that optometrists must be more selective when referring patients to hospital care. In many cases, optometrists can follow up their patients themselves instead of referring them to hospital. This seems particularly relevant for conditions such as non-exudative age-relatedmacular degeneration and glaucoma (Landgren & Peters, 2021). The law will also include some updates about the vision assessment for driving licenses, but that has less impact on the scope of practice.",Scandinavian Journal of Optometry and Visual Science,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://open.lnu.se/index.php/sjovs/article/download/3989/3439', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15626/sjovs.v16i1.3989?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15626/sjovs.v16i1.3989, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

112aa283f87d2808c90703bb924ffdf5203c98b5,Postharvest horticulture: a multidisciplinary science field that enables global fresh produce trade,"New Zealand is located in a unique position, while also being unique for developed countries in that a major part of the economic success relies on the production and sale of food to the world. The first shipment of frozen meat from New Zealand to the United Kingdom in 1881 by the ship Dunedin signalled the importance of being at the cutting edge of technology in order to develop and operate the supply chains of perishable products. As such, postharvest scientists within New Zealand have and continue to make important contributions to support horticultural industries, and the unique additional challenges in the supply chain that occurs when you have a live respiring product with inherent biological variability. With rapidly expanding horticultural production within New Zealand and societal drivers to reduce meat and animal product consumption, the need for postharvest horticulture skills and technologies to ensure that products meet consumer’s needs, remains as important as ever. Postharvest science in itself represents a wide scientific skill base allowing the solutions to problems and the generation of knowledge to occur from multiple disciplines. Work presented in postharvest problems ranges from physiology (e.g. gene signalling, metabolomics and cell wall degredation) to technology (e.g. appropriate maturity definition, atmospheric manipulation, heat treatments, etc.) to engineering (e.g. sorting and packaging technologies, cool chain design and mathematical prediction systems). Each component of the postharvest science field plays a role in identifying the causes of problems, narrowing in on the mechanisms and designing solutions to solve the problem as best as possible. The Covid19 pandemic has had many impacts on society. One very noticeable effect on scientists was the inability to travel and meet our colleagues with the same intellectual passions as our own. In particular 2020 was to be a flagship year for postharvest science in New Zealand, with the return of the ISHS Postharvest Symposium, the most important conference of the field, to be held in Rotorua, New Zealand in November 2020. Unfortunately, that was not to be, with the conference delayed until 2024 (https://www.scienceevents.co. nz/postharvest2024). The biannual Plant Science Central held at Massey University in Palmerston North in 2021 was a notable relief in the midst of the pandemic. New Zealand’s tight border controls and elimination policy had led to no cases in the community for a prolonged period and created a unique opportunity for New Zealand-based Plant Scientists to be able to come together, share their work and enjoy the science and social discussions. This special issue was spun out of this conference and the fact that opportunities had been lost over the pandemic, especially for our early career colleagues, where the formation of relationships with other experts of their chosen field is an important part of their career development. This special issue comprises of a group of works, some of which were presented at Plant Science Central 2021, while others were submitted independently of the conference. Twelve (12) high-quality papers are a result of the call for the formation of a postharvest special issue.",New Zealand journal of crop and horticultural science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01140671.2022.2076639?needAccess=true', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/01140671.2022.2076639?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/01140671.2022.2076639, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

72d37590695893e829f2ed5fea809013fb0f5929,Racial/Ethnic Minority Vocational Research Trends: An 11-Year Update,"The educational and vocational landscape in the United States is rapidly changing. These changes are influenced by various factors, such as the increasing racial and ethnical diversity of the population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012), a demand for highly skilled workers, and the departure from the workforce of an aging population, which opens their positions to be filled by the growing racially and ethnically diverse population (Handel, 2013; Toossi, 2013). Career counselors and vocational psychologists should prepare to assist these racially and ethnically diverse individuals as they enter into and navigate this changing workforce. In the present study, we sought to identify recent trends of racial/ethnic minority (REM) career research in order to assess current practices and guide future research to inform interventions for these populations.Forecasts of the U.S. labor force suggest that demographic shifts will result in a high rate of participation by racially and ethnically diverse individuals. REMs composed 38% of the labor force (U.S. Department of Labor, 2016) in 2015 and are expected to account for 43% of the workforce by 2024 (Toossi, 2015). As a group, REMs have unique needs and workplace experiences that warrant attention from career counselors, vocational psychologists, and other professionals who assist people in exploring options, making career decisions, and preparing for employment. Their needs are especially critical as they have long been marginalized from educational and occupational sectors in the United States (Byars-Winston, Fouad, & Wen, 2015). To redress the educational gap and occupational segregation-both of which reinforce economic disparities-researchers need to conduct more studies to understand the specific career needs of this diverse workforce (Byars-Winston et al., 2015; Wells, Delgado-Romero, & Shelton, 2010) and to ensure that counseling interventions are guided by science. Prior studies have noted that REMs in the United States are underrepresented in career research (Byars & McCubbin, 2001; Flores et al., 2006; Wells et al., 2010).A review of the literature suggests a need for a closer examination of the work and career experiences of REMs. Until recently, more than half of published research studies in vocational journals neglected to report racial and ethnic demographic information of participants (Wells et al., 2010). An examination of The Career Development Quarterly (CDQ), the Journal of Career Assessment (JCA), the Journal ofCareer Development (JCD), and the Journal ofVocationalBehavior (JVB) found that only 38% of articles between 1990 and 1999 reported racial and ethnic sample characteristics compared with 54% between 2000 and 2007 (Wells et al., 2010). Recently, Chaichanasakul et al. (2011) reported that approximately 49% of articles published between 1972 and 2007 in JCD reported racial/ethnic characteristics of research samples. Research must go further than reporting demographic characteristics of samples to understand group-specific educational and work experiences of REMs. Separate reviews of vocational journals found that 15% to 16% of empirical articles focused specifically on issues related to racial and ethnic groups (Chaichanasakul et al., 2011; Whiston, Rose, Peterson, & Nguyen, 2013). Despite American Psychological Association (APA; 2010) research standards that mandate reporting racial and ethnic characteristics of research participants, and professional guidelines that encourage the development of scientific knowledge relevant to REMs (APA, 2003), there is clearly room for significant improvement.An analysis of 79 REM career articles published from 1994 to 1999 across six career, counseling, and multicultural journals reported that the articles most frequently were published in JVB (n = 12); focused on college undergraduates (n = 30) or African Americans (n = 20); addressed the topics of occupational perceptions, expectations, interests, and aspirations (n = 18); were theoretical (n = 25) or quantitative (n = 54) studies; and tended to use analysis of variance and multivariate techniques (Byars & McCubbin, 2001). …",,2017.0,14,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/CDQ.12108?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/CDQ.12108, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4cf2b600f2c33525e9cfd295fb55914be76a2cfc,The Reenergize Undergraduate Research Program in Its Second Year,"The initiation of the Re-Energize Undergraduate Research Program was presented in a previous ASEE paper at the 2016 Annual Conference in New Orleans. It started as a network of renewable energy education and research labs fully contained and established at each of the four participating member institutions. The main goal of this collaborative effort is to share effective new green technology content and impart skills to faculty members of this network in order to strengthen their capacities and arm them with additional resources to support their efforts in recruiting and retaining students, and in particular, minorities, in STEM programs offered at their institutions. Our two-year college, San Antonio College (SAC), as part of this network is working on developing and implementing new undergraduate research projects related to green technologies for the entire duration of this partnership. Our college made a commitment to 1) encourage our STEM faculty to attend Re-Energize professional development opportunities to learn and include green energy educational modules into our STEM curriculum; 2) seek space to establish a ""start-up green lab"" on our campus with Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program pass through funding from the four-year institution so that faculty can conduct classroom demonstrations and our students can perform undergraduate research. This initiative is meant to diversify and continue our undergraduate research program as we include our William R. Sinkin Eco Centro facility into this program. 3) promote additional related outreach and educational Re-Energize efforts to support our students and encourage them to seek successful careers in STEM and green energy-related fields and to 4) participate in on-going evaluation and research efforts related to this program. Numerous reports demonstrate that undergraduate research programs at four-year institutions have been responsible for increasing retention and graduation of their students. Our previous results indicate that two-year institutions can also initiate successful programs with similar results. This paper presents in detail the results of the second-year partnership between the participating institutions to continue developing new directions for summer undergraduate research programs at our community college, offers recommendations, and outlines future plans. Career Growth Projections for Engineers Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicates that demand for engineers will continue to show a steady growth during the 2014-2024 period and expects greater-than-average growth from several individual engineering fields with rates ranging from 23.1% for biomedical engineers to 5.3 % for mechanical engineers . The increasing employment of engineers in service industries, research and development, and consulting is expected to generate most of the employment growth. The National Science Foundation in a 2015 Survey of Graduate Students and Post-doctorates in science and engineering [2] found that from 2008 to 2013 STEM graduate students in the U.S. who were U.S. citizens or permanent residents rose 3.1%. Of these, 25.8% were Hispanic and 7.8% were African-American. San Antonio College, being a minority serving institution, has a stated mission to attract and engage minorities on a path toward higher education. A high level of achievement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is essential if the U.S. is to maintain a leading role in space science, aeronautics, cybersecurity, and technology in general. As shown in previous papers, for the last fifteen years San Antonio College has been on a continuously ascending path to attract and retain more students, in particular minorities, into the STEM fields as well as striving to align its engineering program with the engineering programs offered by the surrounding area four-year institutions [3], . At the same time, this college’s engineering faculty made every effort to provide the highest quality education for our students . A previous ASEE paper [6] described a new partnership, called “Re-Energize,” that is expected to help several two-year colleges develop their own research capabilities in renewable energy in collaboration with Texas State University. The Re-Energize program plans to establish a creative research and development (R&D) and professional development (PD) ecosystem. This ecosystem will empower institutions of higher education who prepare students in engineering and engineering technology in Central Texas to continue to do so with enhanced and focused knowledge, facilities, and student programs. Re-Energize addresses the learning needs of faculty and students via a systems approach and aims to serve as a replicable and scalable national model. The previous paper presented the results of the first year of the program. This paper presents the results of the second year of the program. Re-Energize Project: Results of the Second Year (1 Oct 15 to 30 Sep 16) Objective 2: Provide awareness, training, and financial support to attract and motivate students from the minority institutions to consider education and career opportunities in STEM. Activity 2.3: Texas State will facilitate a day-long tour for the participating students to Texas State labs and facility with STEM-oriented educational and entertainment programs. In Year 2, one SAC faculty member and seven students visited Texas State University in February 2016 for a day-long tour of renewable energy demonstration/research laboratories and engineering manufacturing facilities. Texas State faculty and graduate students also provided an update on the Re-Energize program, including research and scholarship opportunities. Comparison of student surveys done before and after the TxState tour showed a significant increase in students’ desire to learn more about sustainability and environmental issues, as well as a significant increase in their knowledge of solar and wind energy technologies. Objective 3: Design and develop a replicable renewable energy laboratory to carry out the training and hands-on activities proposed in the Re-Energize program. A replica of the lab will be established at Eco Centro to operate independently once the training is completed. Activity 3.2: San Antonio College will nominate selected members of STEM faculty and encourage as well as support them to attend the designated Re-Energize professional development activities to learn and adopt green energy educational modules. In Year 2, one faculty member (physics/astronomy) attended the one-week Re-Energize training seminar at Texas State University in May 2016. During the week, Texas State faculty and industry representatives provided a detailed overview of the Re-Energize program including partner institution responsibilities, as well as instruction on sustainable/renewable energy systems and demonstrations of solar, wind, and rainwater catchment systems. Texas State also provided a tour of their engineering/manufacturing lab facilities. Three STEM faculty (two engineering and one environmental) attended the training in Year 1. In Year 2, SAC faculty continued the use of educational modules/activities that were developed during Year 1 for use in engineering and math classes. These modules/activities improved student awareness and learning in sustainability and renewable energy systems. These modules included renewable energy application problems for use in exams as well as a sustainability team design project. The sustainability project is the most complex and ambitious in regards to student learning outcomes. This team project requires students in our Introduction to Engineering classes to modify a builder’s existing new home design to improve its sustainability by reducing its resource consumption and/or improving energy efficiency. Student teams developed written design proposals and gave oral presentations on their more sustainable new home designs. These designs, two of which were done in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity, included two or three sustainability features such as improved insulation, xeriscape landscaping, solar photovoltaic (PV) electric systems, higher efficiency HVAC systems, geothermal systems, sustainable building materials, and rain harvesting systems. This project is most aligned with the following course student learning outcome: As part of a team, design a simple engineering device, write a design report, and present the design. Based on students’ project grades, 91% of students met this student learning outcome by completing this sustainability project. The detailed requirements/guidelines for this team project are provided as Appendices 1 and 2. Activity 3.3: San Antonio College will utilize the funding provided by Texas State and designated for the establishment of a start-up green lab incorporating technical collaboration with Texas State. As year one was drawing to a close, it became apparent that there was a need for a dedicated room other than the shipping container in which experimentation related to hydroponics food production could take place. A laboratory was set up to house the rack prototype, instrumentation, and equipment assembly kits. Design strategy meetings and development of additional prototypes take place in the lab. During the first year of the Re-Energize grant, six students and a college staff member developed a prototype hydroponics grow rack using PVC pipes and a simple wooden structure. The objective was to come up with a design that could be replicated at low cost in developing countries (Fig. 1). The prototype is housed in the lab and has served as a structural starting point for modification and refining during years two and three of the Re-Energize hydroponics project. Even though Year 1 Re-Energize project activity focused heavily on structural aspects of the grow rack, students took into account the need to control many operational factors that directly affect the ",,2017.0,3,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/28998.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--28998?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--28998, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The information about these proposed 11 scholars was submitted to the AGM of SASA (South African Sociological Association) membership including SASA Council members at the annual SASA conference hosted by theUniversity of Zululand early in July 2023.

Here we shall begin formulating further ideas for enhancing our SARS journal andmoreover inviting these 11 to assist with expanding this Board into a group of around 15 members to ensure some representivity from “across the South” (including Latin America, Caribbean, West East Africa, and Central Southeast Asia). In this way, we hope to secure more quality and geographically wide-ranging articles (and new and willing global article reviewers) for SARS over the next five years of journal development. Another task for 2024 will be for our 5-Editorial Collective together with this new Editorial Board of 15+ members to reconstitute the current “International Advisory Board” of SARS, whose 20 incumbent members have not changed in composition for well over a decade. In parallel to the above developments, and also as mentioned in the Editorial for our previous first issue of 2023, SARS 53(1), last year we expanded our Editorial Collective from three to five editors and early this year have also attained two new PhD students to serve as Book Editors. We can report that by the middle of this year, this team of 5 plus 2 has been consolidated and is working well in developing SARS into, hopefully, a leading sociological and broader social science journal for the African continent including “countries of the South” more broadly. We have also had some important responses to our “Call for Proposals” for a series of Special Issues to be hosted in 2024–26 and would still welcome further such proposals on a range of themes which may be submitted to us later this year. We look forward, too, in receiving further new articles for publication within the new two categories that we have introduced alongside our “traditional” Research Article category; namely “Discussion Articles” (normally about 4000–6000 words):",South African Review of Sociology,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/21528586.2023.2253621?needAccess=true', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/21528586.2023.2253621?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/21528586.2023.2253621, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

84189729a13049d608c101869043101d20690763,Petroleum++: SPE’s Uses of Artificial Intelligence and Board Meeting Update,"In this month’s column, I will share news on the recent SPE Board of Directors meeting in Saudi Arabia and SPE’s utilization of artificial intelligence (AI).
 The first of the Board’s quarterly meetings of the year is usually held virtually where several administrative items are discussed and the nomination process for the new Board members gets started. The last meeting of the year is held in conjunction with the SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition (ATCE). The middle two meetings are usually held in areas with significant industry operations that gives the Board an opportunity to meet the leaders of SPE sections and regions. The spring 2023 meeting was held for the first time in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
 Below are some of the key decisions reached at the meeting.
 - Approved the nominating committee’s recommendations for the 2025 SPE President—Olivier Houzé; Data Science and Engineering Analytics Technical Director—Sushma Bhan; Asia Pacific Regional Director—Hazli Sham Kassim; Europe Regional Director—Pierre Emmanuel d’Huart; Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Director—Carlos Alberto Pedroso; North American Regional Director—Kim Oracheski; and the Russia and Caspian Regional Director—Alexey Borisenko. More information about these volunteers was published in the April JPT.
 - Approved the budget for SPE’s fiscal year 2024, which runs from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.
 - Reviewed the activities for selling the building in Richardson, Texas.
 - Updated the process for countries/sections that wish to be considered for an exception to the membership dues.
 - Removed the requirement for students to provide a full technical paper for participation in the Regional Student Paper Contest.
 - Approved SPE CCUS International Conference and Exhibition, October 2023, in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia.
 - Formed a work group to develop a long-term plan for SPE’s flagship event, ATCE.
 - Approved SPE policy on AI-generated content in publications (details on the policy are available here).
 - Updated the Charitable Contribution Policy when SPE donates to areas where our members are affected by natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes.
 In conjunction with the meeting in Dhahran, Board members attended the monthly meeting of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Section, with about 500 members, to discuss local and Society-level activities. Saudi Aramco arranged for the Board to visit the Shaybah field operations and the natural wildlife sanctuary in the Rub’ al-Khali, or Empty Quarter.
 It is interesting how the challenges of operating a large oilfield facility in a remote area like the Empty Quarter are like what I used to see with operations of the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk fields in the North Slope of Alaska. It is telling the extent of what we do to provide the world with energy it needs when at airports like in Anchorage next to the counters of United, American, and Alaska Airlines, there were counters for ARCO, BP, and ExxonMobil.
 The next Board meeting in July 2023 will be held in Kuala Lumpur.

Hipparcos has now been superseded by the results of the Gaia mission. The second Gaia data release contained astrometric data for almost 1.7 billion sources with tens of microarcsec (or microarcsec per year) accuracy in a vast volume of the Milky Way and future data releases will further improve on this.

5be5c8744e855c6125f616370a5f925c4dba7a15,Rapid Surge of Chikungunya in Pakistan Demands Urgent Action,"Chikungunya virus infection is a vector-borne disease that has emerged as a serious public health concern around the world over the past two decades. The disease is associated with a significant morbidity rate with an increased risk of lifelong impairment along with psychological and economic consequences.  Although severe complications are uncommon, chikungunya virus disease (CHIKVD) causes debilitating and persistent joint pain, neurological symptoms, inflammation in the heart muscle, liver damage as well as multiple organ failure in severe cases, which can be life threatening mostly in infants and elderly population.1  The first Chikungunya vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023 is currently licensed in the United States, however, there is no vaccine available in the endemic countries.2 
CHIKV was first identified in Pakistan in 1983 to be circulating in rodents with a limited number of human infections. Since 2015, outbreaks of CHIKV in human population have become more frequent primarily during dengue epidemics.3 The local transmission was confirmed by February 28, 2016 and according to National Institute of Health, Pakistan, a total of 8,521 laboratory confirmed cases were reported from December 2016 till March 2018, with Sindh and Balochistan accounting for the majority of reported cases.4 According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, as of November 30 2024, around 480,000 cases of CHIKVD have been reported worldwide, with over 200 deaths in 2024. Pakistan is among the 23 countries reporting the CHIKVD with approximately 5,726 cases confirmed during the latest outbreak in 2024.5 
Pakistan being a subtropical country, is becoming more vulnerable to the transmission of chikungunya and other vector-borne diseases including dengue, malaria and leishmaniasis due to changes in the climate patterns such as longer summers, shorter milder winters, and an increased frequency of unpredictable and severe weather events. The CHIKVD appears to have overlapping symptoms (fever and severe joint pains) with other viral illnesses such as dengue, which often leads to misdiagnosis resulting in the mistreatment of both illnesses causing serious challenges for healthcare professionals. In addition, an underestimated disease burden is reported. The mosquito vectors responsible for Chikungunya virus transmission are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, species prevalent in Pakistan during and after the monsoon season and the same species also transmit dengue and Zika viruses.6 All of these factors including the upcoming monsoons are likely to contribute to the endemicity of the CHIKVD in Pakistan over the coming year. 
In Pakistan, the overall impact of the CHIKVD is multifaceted with ambiguous consequences due to an underestimated disease burden. The increasing prevalence associated with Chikungunya alongside other vector-borne infections underscores an urgent need for further scientific exploration and public health interventions to alleviate the effects of this emerging infectious 
disease. The impact of Chikungunya on human health can be overwhelming, particularly in countries like Pakistan already burdened by dengue and malaria outbreaks. This emphasizes an immediate and rigorous strategy, including public health campaigns, to be prepared and implemented by the coordinated actions of various health departments including the Ministry of National Health Services Regulations and Coordination (NHSR&C), National Institute of Health (NIH) Pakistan, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and other related divisions.

3ac81a49b28366f525307010a05e6aa969b29882,A cluster randomized stepped wedge implementation trial of scale-up approaches to ending pregnancy-related and -associated morbidity and mortality disparities in 12 Michigan counties: rationale and study protocol,"Background Hospital-focused maternal health safety and quality guidelines have been found to reduce pregnancy-related and -associated morbidity and mortality (PRAMM). Unfortunately, quality of obstetric care can improve without affecting disparities. This project is the first controlled implementation trial to test approaches to implementing safety guidelines that: (1) target PRAMM disparities; and (2) focus on community care (care provided outside hospitals in outpatient and other community settings, and coordination among care settings), where most deaths occur. It is also one of the first to test scale-up or sustainment implementation approaches to addressing maternal morbidity and mortality disparities. Methods This project, one of three in the federally funded Multilevel Interventions for Raci.a.l Equity (MIRACLE) Maternal Health Research Center of Excellence, will develop and evaluate an implementation approach for scaling up bundled equity-focused maternal health safety guidelines in community care settings county-wide. The scale-up approach will be co-developed with partners, and then tested using a cluster randomized stepped-wedge trial of 12 Michigan counties with a total population of nearly 6 million. Randomization occurs at the county level; birthing people and providers are clustered within counties. PRAMM outcomes (individual level; primary) will be extracted from a pre-existing statewide linked dataset that includes Medicaid claims and vital records data. The sample will include all Medicaid insured individuals in the 12 counties observed during pregnancy, at birth, and up to 1 year postpartum during the project period (~ 151,920 births, including ~ 49,110 births to Black and/or Hispanic mothers). Implementation outcomes (provider level) will be collected using annual provider (n = 600) surveys and will include scale-up (penetration, reach, control for delivery, and intervention effectiveness at scale) and sustainment (maintenance of fidelity to core elements, health benefits, and capacity to deliver core elements over time) of bundles and cost-effectiveness of implementation approaches. Discussion This implementation trial will be the first to evaluate an implementation approach to scaling community health equity-focused maternal safety guidelines, addressing an understudied aspect of implementation science (i.e., scale-up). The study will also provide information about implementation cost-effectiveness needed to drive policy decisions.

b5325c6e96f4baa7a415f9c52526653d96f69e07,The algorithm to determine the highest priority of enrollees in the 2023 admissions campaign,"В 2023 году вступили в силу изменения в части процедуры организации и проведения приема на обучение по образовательным программам высшего образования – программам бакалавриата, программам специалитета, программам магистратуры на 2023/2024 учебный год. Основное нововведение будущей приемной кампании – зачисление абитуриентов на основании приоритетов. Расстановкой приоритетов поступающий демонстрирует свое желание быть зачисленным на конкретные направления подготовки/специальности в определенной последовательности. Авторами сделан вывод о существовании проблемы, связанной с отсутствием алгоритма, который позволяет автоматически определить высший приоритет абитуриента на каждом этапе зачисления. Таким образом, обозначена цель исследования – разработать соответствующий алгоритм. Рассмотрен алгоритм Гейла-Шепли и сферы его применения, в частности, возможность применения для установления паросочетаний между абитуриентами и конкурсными группами. Сделан вывод, что данный алгоритм не может быть использован образовательными организациями высшего образования при проведении приемной кампании 2023 года в связи с имеющимися допущениями в его работе. Предложены собственные методы решения задачи определения высшего приоритета в соответствии с утвержденными правилами приема на 2023/2024 учебный год. В статье представлена математическая модель задачи и разработанная вычислительная часть компьютерной программы на языке программирования Python. Апробация алгоритма будет осуществляться в ГУМРФ имени адмирала С.О. Макарова при проведении приемной кампании 2023 года. Материалы статьи представляют практическую ценность для приемных комиссий образовательных организаций.
 In 2023, changes to the admissions procedure came into force which affected enrollment in educational programs of higher education – bachelor's programs, specialty programs, master's programs for the academic year 2023/2024. The main innovation of the future admission campaign is the enrollment of applicants based on priorities. By prioritization, the applicant demonstrates his or her desire to be enrolled in specific fields of study in a particular order. The authors concluded that there is a problem associated with the lack of an algorithm that helps to automatically determine the highest priorities of the applicant at each stage of enrollment. Therefore, the purpose of the study is indicated – to develop an appropriate algorithm. The Gale-Shapley algorithm and its scope are considered – in particular, the possibility of using it to stable matching between applicants and competition groups. It was concluded that this algorithm cannot be employed by educational organizations of higher education in the 2023 admissions campaign due to the existing assumptions in its operation. We have proposed our own methods for solving the problem of determining the highest priorities according to the approved admission rules for the academic year 2023/2024. The article presents a mathematical model of the problem and the computational part of a computer program using Python programming language.

01f8eec44c46fab9e4a12ae4fed2eb5a1ecdcb58,GMAP – European Mapping efforts for Geologic Mapping of Planetary bodies,"<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> One essential part of NASA&#180;s planetary geologic mapping program [1] is to coordinate and standardize the geological map process and products in planetary science. This important role is taken by the Astrogeology Team as USGS since the early sixties.</p>
<p>Within the scope of an EU project called <em>PLANetary MAPping </em>(PLANMAP, [2]), which ended this year, initial steps to develop complementary expertise in the EU was done. To continue addressing<strong> </strong>the major scientific and technological challenges facing modern planetary science and strengthen Europe&#180;s position and the forefront of space exploration a new pan-EU infrastructure, the <em>EUROPLANET 2024 Research Infrastructure</em> (EPN-2024-RI), is coordinating mapping efforts in the EU and with international partners. &#160;</p>
<p>One component of this 4-year-project is the<em> Geologic MApping of Planetary bodies </em>(GMAP). This aims to serve the European planetary community through an infrastructure to foster, support, and sustain the production of planetary geological maps and related products following standard procedures [e.g., 3]). In order to do so, GMAP is directly building on the PLANMAP work [2], and several partners and institutions with previous experience in planetary geologic mapping are involved. That means a planetary scientist can produce a geological map or a derived higher-level product through GMAP <em>Virtual Access</em> (VA) with the help and advice of the GMAP partner institutions, who will provide base-maps and technical aid as part of the <em>Joint Research Activity</em> (JRA). The maps will provide support for ongoing and future planetary missions, training activities, and non-standard science-driven mapping projects, such as space resource mapping.</p>
<p><strong>GMAP &#8211; motivation and focus: </strong>The primary focus of GMAP is to streamline the processes which are involved in the production of geological and geomorphological maps of planetary surfaces. Here, we are mainly collecting existent approaches and related documents which handle the standardization of GIS-based mapping processes to enable the European community in creating cartographic products. The aim is to describe, develop, store, combine (!), access, update, revise, and finally, visualize scientific cartographic products. As soon as these steps can be handled in well-defined workflow and distributed among researchers and mappers, the highest possible level of homogenization, and thus standardization, is reached. This is the essential step to use these research products as a basis for broader studies. During the first year, coordination activities targeted the planning and the initial setup of digital infrastructure services that will be needed for supporting VA and JRA activities. The domain europlanet-gmap.eu was acquired by GMAP and will serve as the entry point for presenting the GMAP initiative, collecting most notable resources, for users&#8217; access, for providing basic guidance for publishing new maps, request support and contribute to the overall project. The website is built on the same open source Content Management System (<em>WordPres</em>s, [4]) already employed for the main Europlanet website, on https://europlanet-society.org. The GMAP data portal (see figure 1, [5]) and additional services and tools are being setup.</p>
<p><strong>GMAP &#8211; requirements and developments: </strong>In order to extract the requirements to support the European community in streamlining their planetary geological maps, a document was produced during the last year of JRA activities. The document contains state of the art information in this field and addresses the geologic mapping and cartographic aspects of the various Solar System bodies.<br />Geologic process-specific and body-specific best practice and published case studies are included in [1]. The approaches for two-dimensional mapping and three-dimensional geologic mapping and modelling are introduced, as well as the range of non-standard map types that are envisaged within GMAP activities.<br />In particular the following main topics are in development: 1) a mapping guide with essential information for the GIS-based mapping process, including CRS symbology, metadata, and naming conventions; 2) mapping templates for GIS-based mapping and for final map layout, as well as instructions about naming conventions [6].<br />Mapping review directions are indicated, as well data sharing, distribution and discovery. Proposed standards, best practices, and tools are based on those existing, as well as on additional or new developments and adaptations [e.g. 7]. The document will be periodically updated.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p><strong>GMAP &#8211; summary and outlook: </strong>The development of the GMAP data portal [5] was initiated, based on existing developments from PLANMAP. The availability of GMAP products and underlying datasets is going to be FAIR (<strong>f</strong>indable, <strong>a</strong>ccessible, <strong>i</strong>nteroperable, and <strong>r</strong>eusable [8]), as also recommended by the VA Review Board (see also [9]), and building on the practices of PLANMAP [10], see also e.g. [11]). The use of existing tools by NASA and USGS such as <em>Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers</em> (ISIS, [12]), and <em>Ames Stereo Pipeline </em>(ASP, [13]) will be promoted. Moreover, in addition to the community support by the GMAP VA, interaction with the community via OpenPlanetary [14] is also planned. All further information and current developments are available via [15] and [16].</p>

While effective rehabilitation of patients with SCI remains a significant challenge, novel neural engineering technologies have emerged to target and promote dormant neuroplasticity in the central nervous system. Objective This study aims to develop, pilot test, and optimize a platform based on multiple immersive man-machine interfaces offering rich feedback, including (1) visual motor imagery training under high-density electroencephalographic recording, (2) mountable robotic arms controlled with a wireless brain-computer interface (BCI), (3) a body-machine interface (BMI) consisting of wearable robotics jacket and gloves in combination with a serious game (SG) application, and (4) an augmented reality module. The platform will be used to validate a self-paced neurorehabilitation intervention and to study cortical activity in chronic complete and incomplete SCI at the cervical spine. Methods A 3-phase pilot study (clinical trial) was designed to evaluate the NeuroSuitUp platform, including patients with chronic cervical SCI with complete and incomplete injury aged over 14 years and age-/sex-matched healthy participants. Outcome measures include BCI control and performance in the BMI-SG module, as well as improvement of functional independence, while also monitoring neuropsychological parameters such as kinesthetic imagery, motivation, self-esteem, depression and anxiety, mental effort, discomfort, and perception of robotics. Participant enrollment into the main clinical trial is estimated to begin in January 2023 and end by December 2023. Results A preliminary analysis of collected data during pilot testing of BMI-SG by healthy participants showed that the platform was easy to use, caused no discomfort, and the robotics were perceived positively by the participants. Analysis of results from the main clinical trial will begin as recruitment progresses and findings from the complete analysis of results are expected in early 2024. Conclusions Chronic SCI is characterized by irreversible disability impacting functional independence. NeuroSuitUp could provide a valuable complementary platform for training in immersive rehabilitation methods to promote dormant neural plasticity.

619364db777e50c2371dcc42a69e17008b1f843f,Improving the Mechanisms for Attracting Foreign Researchers to World-Class Research Centres: Practical Aspects,"Introduction. According to the target indicators of the national project “Science” in the six-year period from 2019 to 2024 inclusive, a network of world-class research centres (WCRC) should be created in Russia to carry out research and development in mathematics, genetics, and other priority areas of scientific and technological development in Russia. As the new centres are predicated upon a completely new vision of the organisation of Russian science in a global context, to achieve maximum effectiveness, certain measures must be taken to simplify migration regimes for foreign citizens who plan to conduct scientific and/or pedagogical activities in the Russian Federation. 
Methods. To study the experience of other countries, as well as the experience of leading Russian universities and research organisations in simplifying migration policies for foreign scientists, this article uses comparative and retrospective methods of analysis; to develop proposals for simplifying the entry procedure for foreign scientists participating in WCRC projects, the deductive method is used. 
Results and Discussion. It is recommended that: 1) organisations where the world-class research centres have been set up, as well as organisations participating in world-class research centres, should use the best Russian practices for attracting foreign researchers developed and adopted by Skolkovo, the Higher School of Economics, Tomsk State University, The A. Steklov Mathematics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and others; 2) amendments should be made to Federal Law No. 115-FZ dated 25 July 2002 in the form of a new article outlining special conditions for the entry of foreign researchers into Russia and their employment by organisations affiliated with Russian worldclass research centres (this category of foreign nationals will not need to obtain a work permit, the time for reviewing their application to enter Russia should be reduced from 14 to 5 days, etc.); 3) amendments are to be made to the Russian Government's Resolution No. 335 dated 9 June 2003, to reduce the time it takes to issue a visa to researchers employed by Russian worldclass research centres from 20 to 10 business days from the date the application is submitted, plus a new type of visa is to be introduced and issued to such individuals: a research visa. 
Conclusion. The recommendations made in this article on how to improve the migration policy for foreign researchers who plan to take part in projects run by Russian world-class research centres may in future be considered by specialised agencies when making management decisions, as well as used as the foundation of new amendments to regulatory documents governing migration. The proposed amendments may subsequently become an impetus for more active efforts to draw the attention of the international scientific community to the work carried out by Russian world-class research centres and for more concerted efforts to bring more world-class researchers onboard in research and development efforts taking place in Russia.",Science Governance and Scientometrics,2020.0,3,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.33873/2686-6706.2020.15-3.270-306', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33873/2686-6706.2020.15-3.270-306?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33873/2686-6706.2020.15-3.270-306, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Therefore, population policies in most countries are mainly focused on reducing or increasing fertility. Nowadays, we are facing a decrease in the tendency to have children in Iran, so that the total fertility rate (TFR) has decreased to 6.5 since mid-1978 and reached replacement level fertility in 1999 and is expected to decrease to 1.13% during 2020 - 2024. According to the Low Population Growth Scenario released by the United Nations in 2010, if Iran continues replacement level fertility and has no plan to balance it, its population will reach 31 million in the next 80 years, and 47 percent will be the elderly over 60 years. These statistics and reports have caused serious concerns for the authorities, and the Supreme Leader of Iran has mentioned this issue several times and called for serious planning and legislation to get out of this situation. This has made population growth policies one of the priorities of the government. Meanwhile, according to previous researches, Markazi province is ranked as the third city in terms of the low desire of women to have children. This study aimed to determine the factors related to childbearing willingness in 18-45 -year old women referring to Arak health centers in 2019. Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 255 women aged 18-45 years, in 2019. The women were unwilling to have children. Data were collected from these women referring to 10 health centers in Arak who were selected through cluster sampling. Sampling was performed in January 2019. The data were collected through a questionnaire and included demographic information and variables related to childbearing willingness taken from Piltan et al.' questionnaire (2015) which included 78 items on religious beliefs (21 items), economic status (15 items), social participation (14 items), marital satisfaction (6 items), childbearing problems (7 extracurricular activities such as education, employment, and social activities while caring for their children, and on the other hand, the tendency to have children may increase by reducing the problems of childbearing. One of the limitations of the present study was that self-report of marital satisfaction and economic status may have affected the accuracy of the results, which was beyond the control of the researcher.",Iran Journal of Nursing,2021.0,3,"{'url': 'http://ijn.iums.ac.ir/files/site1/user_files_e64ade/rozayaz12343-A-10-2677-2-a356538.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.52547/ijn.34.130.15?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.52547/ijn.34.130.15, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

40a2b3728998fd481e92a623bfd3a0b7210ea8ba,FPGA Based Hardware Abstraction of Quantum Computing System,"
 The number of transistors per unit area are increasing every year by virtue of Moore’s law. It is estimated that the current rate of evolution in the field of chip design will reduce the transistor to atomic scale by 2024. At atomic level the quantum mechanical characteristics dominate, affecting the ability of transistors to store information in the form of bits. The quantum computers have been proposed as one way to effectively deal with this predicament. The quantum computing circuits utilize the spinning characteristics of electron to store information. This paper describes a proposition of resource efficient FPGA based quantum circuit abstraction. A non-programmable embedded system capable of storing, introducing a phase shift in the qubit and its measurement is implemented. The main objective of the proposed abstraction is to provide a FPGA based platform comprising of fundamental sub blocks for designing quantum circuits. A primary quantum key distribution algorithm i.e BB84 is implemented on the proposed platform as a proof of concept. The distinguishing feature of the proposed design is the flexibility to enhance the quantum circuit emulation accuracy at the cost of computational resources. The proposed emulation exhibits two principal properties of the quantum computing i.e. parallelism and probabilistic measurement.",,2021.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-467244/latest.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21203/rs.3.rs-467244/v1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-467244/v1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This project aims at developing a game that supports VR, mobile, and computer concurrently with a single codebase. With broader hardware coverage, not only more players can enjoy the game, but also the game revenue will increase drastically. The final deliverable of this final year project will be a cross-platform multiplayer cooperative game that supports VR Devices (Oculus Quest 2), computers (Windows machines), and mobile phones (Android). Unity is chosen as the game engine for the project because it can deploy the game on more than 20 platforms and Photon is the chosen multiplayer engine because of its compatibility with Unity . Currently, 2 puzzle levels have been implemented and the boss fight level development is still in progress. The project will soon be moving into the VR control integration stage. With limited budget and time, it is impossible to support all kinds of gaming consoles/hardware and produce a standard-length, polished game.

This leads to changes in educational environment considering the requirements for the development of digitalization in agro – industrial complex (AIC). In this regard, the conditions of education and training of engineering personnel with competencies for working in AIC digital economy are also changing. 
The authors studied influence of the main trends in the development of digital fluency and digital competencies on the formation of engineering human resources in AIC. Particular attention was paid to the analysis of the development of the human resources component of the digital economy of AIC in this region, in particular, according to the parameters of “Personnel for Digital Economy” project in the Chelyabinsk Region, it is planned to increase the share of population with digital fluency and key competencies in digital economy from 27% in 2019 to 80% by year 2024. 
Human resources are the most important strategic resource for the development of AIC digitalization. At the same time, labor requirements are constantly growing. Formation of digital competencies should be the goal of engineers, and the development of a mechanism to achieve this goal is the main task of state personnel policy, science and education.

7ba0b648d4cbd27228edb2b2b2032bbab770fe82,Impact of policies regulating foreign physician migration to Switzerland: a modelling case study in anaesthesia,"BackgroundSeveral countries have developed policies that restrict or limit duration of stay, clinical privileges or the number of residency permits allocated to migrating physicians. Switzerland is currently preparing a new law limiting overall foreign immigration. The impact of such restrictive policies is currently unknown. In a case study of anaesthesia care in Switzerland we modelled, trends in the size of physicians’ workforce until 2024, following the implementation of a strict quota policy for foreign medical trainees.MethodsWe developed a computer-based Markov model with Monte-Carlo simulations to project, in the context of a strict quota policy for foreign trainees, supply and demand for anaesthesia positions until 2024. We used data from a cross-sectional study performed in the French- and Italian-speaking cantons of Switzerland and the Health dataset from the OECD.ResultsWith 8 to 12 (95 % CI 4–20) anaesthetists retiring per year, the implementation of strict quotas of foreign graduates would result in a 38 % decrease in the number of anaesthetists in intermediary (senior registrars) positions by 2024. This decrease would be particularly important in district hospitals where nearly half (49 %) of the non-Swiss anaesthetists are practising. Swiss graduates are unlikely to balance the shortage. Despite efforts by Swiss universities to increase the number of medical graduates, their number has dropped from 10.5 to 9.7/100 000 inhabitants between 2000 and 2012, due to the growth of the population.ConclusionsThis case study in Latin Switzerland shows that a restrictive policy limiting foreign immigration of trainees would result in a major deficit in the number of anaesthetists available to meet population needs. These aspects should be carefully considered when countries develop restrictions and limitations of foreign immigration.",BMC Health Services Research,2015.0,4,"{'url': 'https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12913-015-0867-3', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4440310, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There are two upcoming total solar eclipses that can be seen from different parts of the United States (August 21, 2017 and April 8, 2024), and they provide teachers with an amazing opportunity to engage students with a remarkable astronomical event. We summarize the science behind eclipses and describe an inexpensive activity for students from third grade up through middle school that will let them use models to see the differences between total, annular, and partial solar eclipses. The activity lets students explore why, during a solar eclipse, people in different areas will see different types of eclipses.

b2428627d12e5c2e1ab53c20c6301728c7c865b8,Space Technology and Africa's Development: The Strategic Role of Small Satellites,"In 2014 the African Union adopted a 10-year Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa (STISA-2024). The strategy provides a flexible framework for adopting flagship programs that involve a number of countries based on their needs, capabilities and long-term development objectives. Some areas of technological endeavor, however, represent foundations upon which economic activities are constructed. One of those areas is building geospatial data infrastructure. This can be achieved through a variety of data-collecting measures ranging from large satellites to unmanned aerial vehicles. The opportunity to use remote sensing technology for development has never been greater. There are over 100 remote sensing satellites currently in orbit, with over half designed to gather imagery that could be used for development. The industry is also growing: the OECD estimates that over 250 satellites will be launched during this decade alone, compared to half that amount during the last decade. Recent innovations around satellite technologies have also driven down costs and made it viable for low-income countries to develop cost-effective satellite programs. This paper examines small satellite programs as windows of opportunity for countries to achieve their development goals. First, it locates the potential socioeconomic benefits of satellites in low-income countries. Next, it explores the recent history of, and lessons learned by, South Africa, Brazil, and South Korea. While tens of other countries have developed satellite programs, these case studies offer insights into how and why countries have created successful programs. Next, this chapter examines the latest technologies and focuses on emerging opportunities for current and future space programs. Lastly, it develops concrete options and a clear strategy for policymakers in emerging markets to consider when designing future programs.",,2017.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/ssrn.3078914?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3078914, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Employers seek technical computer specialists who can write software and invent new applications, but American universities are only training enough students to fill about 40% of the projected 1.1 million technology and computing jobs expected by 2024 (National Center for Women and Information Technology, 2016). Moreover, a lack of gender parity within the U.S. technology industry has long been viewed as a critical problem, detracting from innovation and prosperity. Pursuit of information technology (IT) majors depends, to a great extent, on students’ attitudes toward IT. This study developed an Attitude toward IT Scale with a gender subtext to measure certain attitudes toward IT, held by college students. The norm group consisted of mostly freshmen enrolled in 2011 (N = 373), at a large four-year public university in Illinois. Reliability and validity of the 30-item Scale were examined by using Cronbach’s alpha and a principal components factor analysis with orthogonal rotation using varimax with Kaiser normalization; the rotation converged in seven iterations. Results of data analyses showed that overall reliability is high (0.85), and factor analyses revealed five orthogonal factors with high coefficient alphas—factors that represented relevant attitude constructs. This Scale may be used by educators at the senior high school and college levels to evaluate the effectiveness of different teaching/learning strategies in promoting positive student attitudes toward IT, and in improving learning among students. The Scale is unique in that it includes attitudes toward gender equality of opportunity in IT.

We evaluate the programmatic alignment of Chile’s statelessness reduction plan, #Chilereconoce, with policy enacted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in that office’s campaign to eradicate statelessness by the year 2024. In addition to evaluating the structure of Chile’s statelessness reduction plan, we explore the policy outcomes of this plan in achieving its desired goal of reducing statelessness in Chile. We use Chile as a case study because it implemented the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ 2014-2024 Action Plan and, therefore, can shed light on if such a plan can put a nation-state on the path to remedy the deleterious effects of statelessness. Our central argument is that Chile’s statelessness reduction plan can, in-fact, serve as a blueprint for governmental institutions to follow towards achieving the goal of reducing statelessness.

8bdd5a3046e957c4e7b1d4b80262f8def0c371d3,The Significance of ICT Services for the Balance of Payments in the Republic of Serbia,"Abstract The balance of payments deficit is the problem faced by numerous countries. To solve the problem of the balance of payment deficit, the creators of economic policy try to stimulate the sectors that secure the largest inflow of foreign currencies and have a beneficial impact on the reduction of deficit. The international trade in informational, computer and telecommunication services records enormously high growth rates in the 21st century. The specificity of ICT sector opens a perspective even to less developed economies to take part more significantly in the exports, which hold a large percentage of a value-added. The goal of this paper is to determine the significance of ICT services for the balance of trade and the current account adjustment, as well as the contribution to generating the surplus of the total balance of services. In the case of the Republic of Serbia, the surplus of ICT sector covers almost one-fifth of the balance of trade deficit, almost one-third of the current account deficit, while every fourth dollar achieved by the services’ exports is achieved by the exports of ICT services. If the same trend of ICT sector’s growth continues, the predictions say that the surplus of this sector will be enlarged by almost 60% till the year of 2024, when compared to the level in 2020. Finally, potentially the most significant advantage, which ICT sector brings with itself, is the reduced brain drain, which is the most destructive consequence brought to the less developed countries by the liberalization of workforce’s movement.",Economic Themes,2022.0,3,"{'url': 'https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/ethemes-2022-0011', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2478/ethemes-2022-0011?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2478/ethemes-2022-0011, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8108243279d4394516382778d0cff9cecf7539d7,Environmentalism in surgical practice.,"Most surgeons equate environmentalism with the softer sciences related more to personal philosophy than with anything connected to the harder science and business of healing patients. Only after we can get beyond the jokes about “saving whales” and “hugging trees” and “going green,” canwe truly appreciate environmentalism in surgery for what it is: a smart, efficient, and cost effective way to do business in 2016. In the past decade, and especially in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, there has been national emphasis on improving the quality of health care delivery and increasing transparency while decreasing cost. Ironically, this is happening at a time when rapidly evolving technology is making health care more and more expensive. By evaluating the current system and eliminating waste and unnecessary expense, providers and health care systems can achieve that balance between quality and affordability. When waste accounts for at least 20% of health care costs, the current system of tight operating margins and hypersensitive awareness to expense is bound to fail. Medicare and Medicaid estimates that health care spending is growing at a rate of 1.1% per year (faster than Gross Domestic Product [GDP] itself). By 2024, it would account for 19.6% of GDP. Overall, 60% of all hospital costs are accrued in the operating room (OR). Surgeons are stewards of the medical profession and leaders, not just in the OR, but in their communities as well. As such, it is the surgeon’s obligation to proactively address the issues of quality and cost at the same time as environmental concerns such as global warming, landfill burden, toxic waste disposal, and limited and dwindling precious resources. Luckily for surgeons, these issues are",Current problems in surgery,2016.0,46,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1067/j.cpsurg.2016.02.001?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1067/j.cpsurg.2016.02.001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b6b6662990b344b15edaa6736356e29308a5acb7,THE NINTH FORUM OF THE EUROPEAN & DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CLINICAL TRIALS PARTNERSHIP,"The EDCTP community meets biennially to share research findings, plan new partnerships and collaborations, and discuss maximising impact from EDCTP-funded research. In 2018, the Ninth EDCTP Forum took place in Lisbon, Portugal, from 17–21 September 2018. The Lisbon meeting was the largest international conference focusing on clinical research on poverty-related infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. It started with a strong commitment, from European and African EDCTP member countries, for a successor programme to EDCTP2 (2014–2024). It provided a platform for the presentation of project results and discussion of progress in clinical research and capacity strengthening in sub-Saharan Africa. The theme of the Ninth Forum was ‘Clinical research and sustainable development in sub-Saharan Africa: the impact of North-South partnerships’. This reflected not only the broader scope of a larger EDCTP research programme but also the growing awareness of the need for global cooperation to prepare for public health emergencies and strengthen health systems. The theme highlighted the impact of Europe-Africa partnerships supporting clinical research and the clinical research environment, towards achieving the sustainable development goals in sub-Saharan Africa. A central topic of the Forum was the discussion of the character and scope of an EDCTP successor programme, which should start in 2021 under the next European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, Horizon Europe. On 17 September, a high-level meeting on this topic took place immediately before the opening of the Forum1. On 19 September, the plenary session continued this discussion through a panel of representatives of strategic partners. There was consensus on the added value of the programme for Europe and the countries in sub-Saharan Africa and political commitment to a successor programme. Poverty-related infectious diseases and a partnership approach will remain central to the programme. There was also a general awareness that all participating countries would need to engage more strongly with a successor programme, both in its governance and in their financial contributions to its objectives. The Forum hosted 550 participants from more than 50’countries. The programme consisted of keynote addresses by policy makers, research leaders, and prominent speakers from Europe and Africa in 5 plenary presentations. There were 9 symposia, 45 oral presentations in parallel sessions, and 74 electronic poster presentations. Abstracts of the plenary, oral and poster presentations are published in this supplement to BMJ Global Health. EDCTP is proud of its contribution to strengthening clinical research capacity in Africa, with more than 400 postgraduate students and 56 EDCTP fellows supported under the first EDCTP programme. The second programme developed a comprehensive fellowship scheme. More than 100 EDCTP fellows (former and current) participated in a one-day pre-conference to discuss the further development of our Alumni Network launched in 2017. The Forum also offered scholarships to many early and mid-career researchers from sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. With the support of the European Union, EDCTP member countries and sponsors, they were able to present results of their studies and meet colleagues from Africa and Europe. The Forum also provided the appropriate platform for recognising individual and team achievements through the four EDCTP 2018 Prizes. With the support of the European Union, EDCTP recognised outstanding individuals and research teams from Africa and Europe. In addition to their scientific excellence, the awardees made major contributions to the EDCTP objectives of clinical research capacity development in Africa and establishing research networks between North and South as well as within sub-Saharan Africa. Dr Pascoal Mocumbi Prize Professor Souleyman Mboup (Professor of Microbiology, University of Cheikh Anta Diop, Dakar; Head of the Bacteriology-Virology Laboratory of CHU Le Dantec, Dakar; and President of IRESSEF, Senegal) was recognised for his outstanding achievements in advancing health research and capacity development in Africa. Outstanding Research Team Prize The prize was awarded to the team of the CHAPAS (Children with HIV in Africa – Pharmacokinetics and acceptability of simple antiretroviral regimens) studies, led by Professor Diana Gibb (MRC Clinical Trials Unit, United Kingdom). Outstanding Female Scientist Prize The prize was awarded to Professor Gita Ramjee (Chief Specialist Scientist and Director of the HIV Prevention Research Unit of the South African Medical Research Council, Durban, South Africa) for her outstanding contributions to her field. Scientific Leadership Prize The prize was awarded to Professor Keertan Dheda (Head of the Centre for Lung Infection and Immunity and Head of the Division of Pulmonology at Groote Schuur Hospital and the University of Cape Town, South Africa) for his research contributions and leadership. Partnership is at the core of the EDCTP mission. In the year before the Forum, Nigeria and Ethiopia were welcomed as the newest member countries of the EDCTP Association, while Angola became an aspirant member. Partnership was also demonstrated by the many stakeholders who enriched the programme by organising scientific symposia, collaborative sessions and workshops.

ade466ad5a67da3b168416a88ad62f3a9d3c91a3,Rival giant telescopes join to seek U.S. funding.,"Two U.S.-led giant telescope projects, rivals for nearly 2 decades, announced this week that they have agreed to join forces. The Giant Magellan Telescope, a 25-meter telescope under construction in Chile, and the Thirty Meter Telescope, which backers hope to build atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are still short of partners and money. They will now work together to win funding from the National Science Foundation, which could help the projects catch up to a third giant telescope, the 39-meter European Extremely Large Telescope, due to begin operations in 2024. It is a historic peace accord to end a conflict that has divided funders and delayed both projects. The partnership commits the two projects to developing a joint plan that would allow astronomers from any institution to use the telescopes; under previous plans observing time was available only to researchers from nations or institutions that had provided funding. The projects are discussing awarding at least 25% of each telescope9s time to nonpartners through a competitive process to be administered by the National Center for Optical-Infrared Astronomy—an umbrella organization that will replace the National Optical Astronomy Observatory sometime in fiscal year 2019. Telescope backers hope the public access plan will help persuade the federal government to pay for at least 25% of the total cost of the two facilities, a share that could reach $1 billion.",Science,2018.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1126/science.360.6391.839?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1126/science.360.6391.839, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

76ec31c29f4e1ebfe710b806344f2f1ca3923391,THE NATIONAL LICENSING EXAMINATION: A COMPARISON WITH OTHER MAJOR MEDICAL LICENSING EXAMINATIONS AND PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR WIDER ACCEPTANCE,"Heads: A medical student completes their Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree after five years of mentally exhausting and back-breaking toil. They then go on to complete one demanding year of internship in a hospital. Now they want to start their clinical practice. The regulatory body of physicians has some other ideas though. It wants them to give yet another exam, covering the same subjects they have cleared during MBBS. When they think they have the right to be practicing independently, they have to study hard and undertake an exam again. 
Tails: A regulatory body of physicians in the country knows the quality of medical teaching in the country is not uniform. The standard of training during internship also varies greatly. Yet, after attaining MBBS degree and completing internship, every medical doctor is deemed qualified enough to manage the patients without any supervision. The regulatory body, therefore, introduces a uniform licensing exam that every doctor needs to pass before starting independent clinical practice. It believes that only those who had attained a minimum acceptable level of competence will eventually be capable enough to pass the exam and thus be qualified to treat people. 
Medical licensing examinations are considered a tool to gauge a doctor’s competence for unsupervised clinical practice. The National Licensing Examination (NLE) was announced on 24th September 2020 in Section 20 of the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) Act 2020.1 The idea was inspired by similar exams in many other countries.2 Fast forward more than one year, this exam still faces stiff resistance from many medical students and Pakistan Medical Association (PMA).3,4 Broadly, there are two main objections: The nature of the exam itself, and its applicability. The medical students deem it unfair to be asked to appear in another exam after obtaining their MBBS degree. Another point of contention is in including all current medical students. It is argued that only those students should be asked to undertake the exam that began their MBBS education after the PMC Act 2020. A petition filed in Lahore High Court to this effect was dismissed by the adjudicating judge, making it mandatory for all current and future medical students to pass the NLE.5 
Is this exam really so flawed that it should be abandoned altogether? Is PMC justified in taking this exam? Are the concerns of the protesting students valid? Is there a middle ground in this conflict? Let us analyze the current format of the NLE and compare it with the two most coveted medical licensing exams in the world. 
The NLE is designed as a two-step examination. The first step is the multiple-choice questions (MCQ) based theory component containing 70% MCQs from clinical sciences and 30% MCQs from basic sciences. A student has to pass this first step in order to qualify for the second Clinical Skills Examination (CSE). The CSE aims to evaluate essential clinical skills required by a general medical practitioner through a structured clinical examination. The students can appear in the first theory component only after acquiring their MBBS qualification. Both steps need to be passed in order to attain permanent medical license from PMC.6 
The United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) is the most well-known medical licensing exam in the world. It is a three-step exam comprising of Step 1, Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK), and Step 3. Step 1, an MCQ exam, is attempted by the local students at the end of 2nd year of medical education. It is designed to test the examinee’s aptitude to apply basic and integral science concepts to clinical scenarios. Step 2 CK is an MCQ exam that assesses the examinee’s grasp on the medical knowledge and understanding of clinical sciences that are considered essential for patient care under supervision. Local students appear in this exam in the 4th year of their medical education; passing this exam is essential to receive medical graduation. Step 3 is again an MCQ exam that assesses the candidate’s caliber to apply medical knowledge for unsupervised practice of medicine. This exam is attempted after obtaining medical graduation and passing the exam is necessary to practice independently in the US. After the decision to abandon the Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) examination in February 2021, there is currently no clinical examination in the USMLE. International Medical Graduates (IMGs) need to clear Step 1 and Step 2 CK (not necessarily in order and at no fixed time) to become eligible for Step 3.7 
The Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board test (PLAB) is a two-part exam taken by General Medical Council (GMC) of the United Kingdom (UK).PLAB 1 is an MCQ based exam that tests the examinee’s ability to apply the acquired medical knowledge to answer clinical-scenario based questions. PLAB 2 is a clinical exam that tests the candidate’s clinical and communication skills on standardized patients.8 Currently, only IMGs need to appear in the exam in order to practice medicine independently in UK. This is set to change from 2024; GMC has announced Medical Licensing Assessment (MLA) that both UK locals and IMGs will need to pass from 2024 onwards in order to attain the medical registration.9 
It is clear from the above discussion that regulatory bodies in many countries including the US test their local students with standardized exam in addition to their medical college graduation. The UK has also announced a similar system for their local students from 2024. Therefore, concept of the NLE is a sound one, based on the international practices. The problem may lie in the format and timing of the exam. 
MBBS curriculum is broadly divided into two categories: Basic sciences and clinical sciences. Basic sciences, as the name suggests, contain core subjects that are essential to understand the basics of human body. These include subjects like anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology etc. These are typically focused more during the first three years of MBBS. Clinical sciences deal with more practical subjects like medicine, surgery, paediatrics, gynaecology etc. These subjects are given more emphasis during the final two years of MBBS. 
The key to the deadlock may lie in the timing and curriculum of NLE. Currently, a student is asked to study all the subjects again after obtaining MBBS degree for the MCQ based theoretical exam.6 This means studying the basic sciences again, the portions of which they may have studied years ago. The exam may be divided into three separate portions comprising of a) MCQ exam of basic sciences, b) MCQ exam of clinical sciences, and c) a clinical skills exam. The idea is to take the exam when the students are actually studying the examined subjects, rather than taking it all together in the end. Table 1 demonstrates the proposed format and timing of the NLE.

Splitting the exam into the three proposed steps will be advantageous for all concerned, i.e. PMC, medical students, and the public. PMC will achieve the desired objective of assessing a physician’s competence before offering registration. Students will be appearing in NLE steps that will be covering subjects in accordance with their current/recent MBBS curriculum. This will reduce the burden for the students and make the exam more agreeable for them. The public will receive healthcare only from those doctors who would have proved their competence.

At least partly as a result, rates at which law school graduates pass the bar exam have declined and remain at historic lows. Yet, during this time, many schools have improved their graduates’ chances of success on the bar exam, and some schools have dramatically outperformed their predicted bar exam passage rates. This Article examines which schools do so and why. Research for this Article began by accounting for law schools’ incoming class credentials to predict an expected bar exam passage rate for each ABA-accredited law school. This Article then examines each law school’s aggregated performance on bar exams for which its graduates sat based on relative and absolute performance, weighing the difficulty of each state’s bar exam. Through this analysis, this Article identifies law schools with consistently higher and lower first-time bar exam passage rates over a period of six years between 2014 and 2019. In addition to identifying law schools that overperform on the bar exam, this Article is a novel contribution not only to the legal education literature but also to the quantitative methodological literature, given its unique tailoring of the classic value-added modeling design to the realities of the bar exam. In the second phase of research for this Article, the authors surveyed administrators at these overperforming and underperforming law schools, as well as law schools in the middle of the distribution, to qualitatively assess how these law schools approach the bar success of their students. Collectively, this Article provides significant insight into how law schools are responding to recent negative trends in bar passage rates, validates successful approaches to mitigate these negative trends, and * CJ Ryan is an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law and an Affiliated Scholar with the American Bar Foundation.

Although passing the bar exam is certainly not the singular reason that a prospective law student seeks to attend law school, success on the bar exam is an important factor—at varying degrees, dependent on the student—in the calculus for why many current students are attending law school.2 After all, without a Juris Doctor School Enrollment for 2020 Remains Stable, AM.

And many law schools have considered a variety of curricular changes, only occasionally with empirical support. See Louis N. Schulze, The Science of Learning Law: Academic Support Measures at Florida International University College of Law, 88 BAR EXAM’R, Summer 2019, at 2, 9, 11; Mario W.

REV. 545, 554–55, 596 (2016). 2. Of course, the decision by a student to attend law school is multifactorial. There is a robust literature on student choice in the undergraduate context of the higher education sector. See generally, e.g., Robert K. Toutkoushian, Do Parental Income and Educational Attainment Affect the Initial Choices of New Hampshire’s College-Bound Students?, 20 ECON. EDUC. REV. 245 (2001); Laura Walter Perna, Differences in the Decision to Attend College among African Americans, Hispanics, and Whites, 71 J. HIGHER EDUC. 117 (2000); Stephen L.

Hearn, Determinants of Postsecondary Education Attendance: Some Implications of Alternative Specifications of Enrollment, 10 EDUC. EVALUATION & POL’Y ANALYSIS 171 (1988). Yet, there is little scholarly attention to student choice in the graduate education context and legal education in particular. Two recent and contemporaneous studies shed light on the factors that prospective students considered in deciding whether to attend law school and the factors that influenced their decisions. In both studies, bar exam success was a factor in most students’ decision to attend law school. However, the extent to which the bar passage rate of a given law school was an important factor in a student’s decision to attend law school varied with the student’s credentials on entry.

8b937ec1d2ec3d0a536fd247047545df6369081a,Success story – 25 years of digitalization of higher education institutions in Poland,"The year was 1999. Polish higher education institutions – HEIs (14 in number), with several European partner HEIs, started the Tempus JEP (New Educational Tools) project. The goal was to purchase or develop a student information system (SIS). At this time, only one Polish university had a system of this type with a central database, but it was not suitable for deployment in other HEIs. Other institutions either had separate systems in each dean's office, without a common database, or they had nothing and used Excel on an ad hoc basis. The conclusions from market recognition were not optimistic – there was no central system that could be purchased for everyone with the money available in the project. What to do?The year is 2024. Polish HEIs (96 in number) are gathered in the University Centre for Informatization (MUCI) consortium† and develop a student information system University Study Oriented System (USOS)‡ for their use. This is a non-profit venture. The USOS system supports all study-related processes, is integrated with other domain systems at the university, and with many central systems in Poland, including systems of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education (further referred to as Ministry), as well as with European networks exchanging data on student and staff mobility (EMREX§, Erasmus Without Paper – EWP**, eduGAIN††).How did it happen that almost 100 HEIs, differing in profile, scientific category, size and form of ownership, jointly develop a tool necessary in everyday operation? This endeavor covers approximately 50% of public HEIs and 23% of all HEIs in Poland, about 67% of students of public HEIs and 47,35% of students of all HEIs in Poland (data is from December 2022, the numbers are higher in 2024), including majority of the top twenty most prestigious Polish HEIs.The purpose of this article is to present the USOS system and the MUCI consortium, as well as the path that MUCI and USOS have taken between 1999 and 2024. I hope that readers will find inspiration in this story, both at the organizational and technical level. The history of USOS and MUCI shows that taking challenges pays off.",EPiC series in computing,,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.29007/xq85?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.29007/xq85, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The methodology involves the distribution of the grant to world-class research centers, depending on the volume of work performed. This is relevant in that at the moment, grants are distributed evenly between world-class research centers every year, and therefore there is no incentive for the centers to intensify work in order to achieve higher values of performance targets. The article thoroughly disclosed the logic of the proposed methodology, presented calculation formulas with explanations. The article discusses the implementation of the tasks of the national project “Science” in terms of creating world-class research centers. The number of centers created in 2019, their types and directions of scientific activity, as well as the number of world-class scientific centers that will be created in subsequent years are indicated in this article. Target performance indicators of the created centers and planned achievements by 2024 are presented.

00dbdc4827cf3feae58f5c874f282440ffd0657c,Status of the assessment phase of the ESA M3 mission candidate LOFT,"LOFT (Large Observatory For x-ray Timing) is one of four candidates for the M3 slot (launch in 2024, with the option of a launch in 2022) of ESAs Cosmic Vision 2015 – 2025 Plan, and as such it is currently undergoing an initial assessment phase lasting one year. The objective of the assessment phase is to provide the information required to enable the down selection process, in particular: the space segment definition for meeting the assigned science objectives; consideration of and initial definition of the implementation schedule; an estimate of the mission Cost at Completion (CaC); an evaluation of the technology readiness evaluation and risk assessment. The assessment phase is divided into two interleaved components: (i) A payload assessment study, performed by teams funded by member states, which is primarily intended for design, definition and programmatic/cost evaluation of the payload, and (ii) A system industrial study, which has essentially the same objectives for the space segment of the mission. This paper provides an overview of the status of the LOFT assessment phase, both for payload and platform. The initial focus is on the payload design status, providing the reader with an understanding of the main features of the design. Then the space segment assessment study status is presented, with an overview of the principal challenges presented by the LOFT payload and mission requirements, and a presentation of the expected solutions.

In a clinicopathological retrospective epidemiological study we investigated benign tumors and tumor-like lesions located in the orofacial region, diagnosed at the Universiy of Szeged, Department of Oral Medicine.


METHOD
During a 54-year period (1960-2014), 14 661 biopsies were taken. The included subjects were 7491 patients diagnosed with benign tumors and tumor-like lesions.


RESULTS
The average age of patients was 55.3 years, 2823 (37.7%) patients were male and 4668 (62.3%) female. The male : female ratio was 1 : 1.65. Most of the patients included in the study were aged 51-60 (1280, 17.1%). The number of children was 1014 (13.6%) and the number of adults was 6477 (86.3%). The number of non-neoplasms was 6420 (85.7%), being significantly higher than the number of neoplasms (1071, 14.3%). Most of the lesions were of mesenchymal origin (5574, 77.4%); the number of lesions of non-mesenchymal origin was 982 (13.1%). The most prevalent type of lesions was traumatic fibroma (fibrosis): 1806 (32.4%). The most common lesion type in the group of lesions of infectious/inflammational origin was pyogenic granuloma, the number of which was 465 (8.3%). The most common cystic lesion was mucocele (805, 10.7%). Hemangioma was the most frequent lesion type among developmental anomalies with the number of 815 (14.6%). The most common location of the lesions was the lip in 2081 cases (27.8%), followed by the gingiva in 2024 cases (27.0%), bucca in 1069 cases (14.3%), tongue in 981 cases (13.1%), and the facial skin in 695 cases (9.3%). After taking biopsy, the majority of benign lesions were treated with cryo-, laser-, or combined (cryo and laser) surgery.


CONCLUSION
The present computer-aided study showed that irritational fibroma was the most common orofacial benign tumor, and the lip was the most frequent location. The diagnostic classification and the methodology are considerably different in the majority of the studies, which may hinder the exact comparison with other surveys from different regions of the world.

Wen-Hua Kuo, who has served as editor-in-chief since 2016, will pass the editorship to Professor Wen-ling Tu, who is currently our associate editor. As Professor Kuo’s term was entering its final year in 2021, the search for a new editor was set in motion in spite of the pandemic. Although Professor Tu was soon chosen as the most qualified candidate for the post, the editorial transition took longer than anticipated due to the administrative reorganization of our sponsor, Taiwan’s Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), which last July changed its name to the National Science and Technology Council. Professors Tu and Kuo have been working together to discuss the editorial board for 2022–2024, and planning with our publishing partner to ensure that the transition goes smoothly and maintains our high editorial standards. Widely recognized for her scholarship in science governance and communication and her devotion to solving science controversies on energy transition and nuclear waste storage, Professor Tu is currently dean of the International College of Innovation and director of the Center for Innovative Democracy at National Chengchi University in Taiwan. She has been engaged in STS in Taiwan since its emergence. Before serving at EASTS, she was editor-in-chief of the Taiwanese Journal for Studies of Science, Technology and Medicine (科技、醫療與社會), the official journal of the Taiwan STS Association, and convener for the reviewing committee of the Discipline of STS and Science Communication (科技、社會與傳播) at MOST. She is also known internationally as the 2018 recipient of the Society for Social Studies of Science’s STS Making and Doing Award (see News and Events, Vol. 12, no. 4), and as an organizer of the Theater of Negotiations at the Taipei Biennial 2020, which was curated by renowned STS scholar Bruno Latour (News and Events, Vol. 15, no. 1).

For example, one SSA victim might lose the ability to compose music after a lifetime of work in musical composition while another SSA victim might forget how to spell or to do arithmetic. The symptoms are varied, but scientists are quite sure that we are seeing the development of a new, devastating disease whose cause has yet to be determined. However, there is a growing suspicion that SSA's are somehow related to the increasing human dependence upon computer technology. The federal study showed that there were 119,450 new cases of SSA in the United States during 2027, as compared to about 99,087 new cases in the previous year, which, according to my wrist calculator, represents an increase of about 20%. SSA's are fast becoming the number one health concern among older Americans, now that Alzheimer's disease has more or less been cured by the use of drug therapies and changes in life style. Alzhe imer ' s reached its peak during the 1990s and 2000s. Late in the 1990s scientists proved that Alzheimer's had a variety of causes, some environmental and some genetic. Changes in lifestyle alone, including engagement in a lifelong program of creative activities and reduced television viewing, helped to e l iminate nearly half of all Alzheimer 's cases. Powerful drugs that stimulate the growth of neurons and atrophied dendritic connections helped to eliminate almost all of the remaining Alzheimer's cases by 2020. Ironically, it was during the year 2020 that the first cases of SSA were diagnosed. Actually, SSA's were probably around since as early as 2000, but not in sufficient numbers to raise concern. However, by 2020 the medical establishment realized that an ailment that could be potentially devastating to human cognitive and intellectual abilities was raging through the population. Unlike Alzheimer's, which affected mostly senior citizens, SSA's affect people starting around age forty, although SSA's are also of concern to the senior population. SSA's cause a patient to ""black out"" in certain subject areas. For example, one SSA patient that we interviewed had been a composer of show tunes. However, as computers became to be used more frequently in composing show tunes and other forms of music, this patient found that his own music composition skills were diminishing. Now, this patient cannot remember or communicate even the most rudimentary rules of musical composition. Indeed, he has lost the ability to read and write musical notation. Yet, his disability is specific to musical knowledge. Outside of this specific domain his memory and his communications skills are perfectly normal. Thus, this ailment is called ""specific subject aphasia"", aphasia being the medical term that applies when a patient can no longer speak. Some researchers have noted that these aphasias are often in areas that were once a passionate interest in a patient's life. For example, the composer that we alluded to had once been very passionate about composing music. He told us that it was a great blow to his ego when a computer system beat him in a competition to provide music for the Broadway show, O.J., that eventually became a major hit. There is growing evidence that SSA's are a direct consequence of human dependence upon computer technology. This theory was first posed by Dr. Arlene Totter at the 2024 International SSA Conference. Her theory is that SSA's are the result of a global deterioration in the microscopic physiology of the human brain that is a direct consequence of human dependence upon computer technology. Earlier this year, at the 2028 International SSA Conference that was held in Buenos Aires, researchers from Oxford University in England have come up with the first concrete evidence that the human brain is changing on a planetary scale due to the use of computer technology, as predicted by Professor Trotter's theory. This work is the research of Drs. Stephen Falcon and Isabella Wilson. Drs. Falcon and Wilson have detected a change in human brain structure in the period 2017-2027 that they attribute to the growing dependence upon computer technology. Many scientists expect Drs. Falcon and Wilson to earn the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. Their research takes us to the cutting edge of brain research. Drs. Falcon and Wilson discovered specific patterns of brain deterioration that they believe is proof of a theory that was presented in the 1980s by British biologist Rupert Sheldrake . Sheldrake postulated that learning is a species-wide phenomenon. According to Sheldrake, when one thousand people learn some new technology, the entire human race is actually learning that new technology on some level. Once a critical mass of pioneers learn that new technology, that learning transfers more easily to the rest of humanity, because all human beings arise from a common biological field that is bePlease see APHASIAS, p. 47",Computer Science On-line Conference,1997.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/270858.581266?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/270858.581266, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1f4b24162f4874da0ef518a945e296daa57aa780,Evaluation of Magnesium Extrusion Production,"Compared with any other pressure processing methods, extrusion is more prone to develop the plasticity of the metal. Extrusions have much better size precision and surface quality than products by rolling and forging. As one-shot molding process, extrusion can eliminate some machining. In addition, extrusions have very high strengths and elongations because of their compact interior structures and fine grains. This paper summarizes some experiences and plans in extrusion production of CQMST(Chongqing Magnesium Science & Technology Co.Ltd). Magnesium, a plentiful element with density of 1.78g/cm3，2/3 of aluminum and 1/4 of steel, is characterized by its high specific strength and toughness, good dumping performance, thermal conductivity and electromagnetism shielding as well as recyclability. Following the advancing technologies of magnesium smelting, high pressure processing, surface treatment and soldering since 1990’s, the prices of magnesium and its ingot stepped down. As an important light engineering material, magnesium application is growing at annual speed of 15%, much higher than aluminum, copper, zinc, nickel and steel. In China, magnesium and magnesium alloy development, application and industrialization has been placed on the National “Tenth Five-year Plans” and the National “863” Scheme, which indicated the coming of new age for magnesium and magnesium alloy development and application in China. In the past, most of the magnesium products were produced by casting, especially die casting and thixomolding. It’s always considered that the crystal structure of magnesium is hexagonal close-packed, and only two slip planes exist at room temperature, so compared with other alloys, it’s very difficult to produce magnesium parts by forging, rolling or extrusion. Nevertheless, practice showed that if heated to a certain temperature, magnesium extrusion may not be hard work, and even easier than 5056 and 2024 aluminum. When extruded with distributary die, magnesium alloy can have better soldering performance than aluminum alloys mentioned above, just because new slip system forms along with increasing temperature (>225°C) and accordingly increases the plasticity of magnesium.",,2005.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.488-489.483?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.488-489.483, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As you doubtless know, you are going to receive a free one year subscription to the Silicon Valley Sentinel-Observer just because you were chosen for This is Your Life. You attended Grover Cleveland Elementary School where you had to be called to the principal's office in the fifth grade because you set fire to a roll of toilet paper in the boy's room. Naughty you! You also put a dead mouse in poor Betty Natale's book bag and that got you snspended fi:om school for a while. At John F. Kennedy Middle School you were caught smoking in the boy's room and were suspended from school for an entire week, At Bjarne Stroustroup High School you straightened out a bit and maintained a Caverage. Of course, in your job application to ComputerCosmos (see below) you claimed that you had a B average in high school. Naughty, Naughty. You scored at the 38th percentile in mathematics and at the 29th percentile in verbal skills on your SATs. You gave up on the idea of becoming a brain surgeon (good thlnking!) and decided to join the ranks of the working man. You graduated from Stroustroup High in 2018 and went on to work as a salesperson at the ComputerCosmos computer emporium in Silicon Heights. It was shortly after graduation that you moved to the swinging single's apartment complex at 1213 Meandering Road in Silicon Heights. It was there that you received your first charge card, VISA card # 1245938431223, which has since expired. It would not be legal for us to reveal your present Master Card card number., but your present balance is $1,234.54 which ineludes a $231.45 interest charge. You bought many interesting tlfings with your original VISA card, but on the positive side you had a love for culture, being an avid reader of Henry Miller. You made repeated visits to Le Sex Shoppe where you purchased all sorts of interesting clothing items, hopefully for your girlfriends. It was at about this time that you opened an account on one of the Global Landscape movie services.

2c0d34406b53d2a8dd210f8bda8547beaea396d3,Fast-track cardiac care for adult cardiac surgical patients.,"BACKGROUND
Fast-track cardiac care is a complex intervention involving several components of care during cardiac anaesthesia and in the postoperative period, with the ultimate aim of early extubation after surgery, to reduce length of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital. Safe and effective fast-track cardiac care may reduce hospital costs. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, updated in 2012 and updated now in 2016.


OBJECTIVES
To determine the safety and effectiveness of fast-track cardiac care compared with conventional (not fast-track) care in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Fast-track cardiac care intervention includes administration of low-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia or use of a time-directed extubation protocol, or both.


SEARCH METHODS
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (January 2012 to May 2015), Embase (January 2012 to May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; January 2012 to May 2015) and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (January 2012 to May 2015), along with reference lists of articles, to identify additional trials. We applied no language restrictions.


SELECTION CRITERIA
We included all randomized controlled trials of adult cardiac surgical patients (coronary artery bypass grafts, aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement) that compared fast-track cardiac care and conventional (not fast-track) care groups. We focused on the following fast-track interventions, which were designed for early extubation after surgery: administration of low-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia during cardiac surgery and use of a time-directed extubation protocol after surgery. The primary outcome was risk of mortality. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, reintubation within 24 hours of surgery, time to extubation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital, quality of life after surgery and hospital costs.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted study data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated a Peto odds ratio (OR) for risk of mortality and used a random-effects model to report risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for all secondary outcomes.


MAIN RESULTS
We included 28 trials (4438 participants) in the updated review. We considered most participants to be at low to moderate risk of death after surgery. We assessed two studies as having low risk of bias and 11 studies high risk of bias. Investigators reported no differences in risk of mortality within the first year after surgery between low-dose versus high-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia groups (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.12; eight trials, 1994 participants, low level of evidence) and between a time-directed extubation protocol versus usual care (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.45; 10 trials, 1802 participants, low level of evidence).Researchers noted no significant differences between low-dose and high-dose opioid-based anaesthesia groups in the following postoperative complications: myocardial infarction (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.99; eight trials, 1683 participants, low level of evidence), stroke (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.78; five trials, 562 participants, low level of evidence) and tracheal reintubation (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.38 to 8.27; five trials, 594 participants, low level of evidence).Comparisons with usual care revealed no significant differences in the risk of postoperative complications associated with a time-directed extubation protocol: myocardial infarction (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.31; eight trials, 1378 participants, low level of evidence), stroke (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.16; 11 trials, 1646 participants, low level of evidence) and tracheal reintubation (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.41; 12 trials, 1261 participants, low level of evidence).Although levels of heterogeneity were high, low-dose opioid anaesthesia was associated with reduced time to extubation (reduction of 4.3 to 10.5 hours, 14 trials, 2486 participants, low level of evidence) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (reduction of 0.4 to 7.0 hours, 12 trials, 1394 participants, low level of evidence). Use of a time-directed extubation protocol was associated with reduced time to extubation (reduction of 3.7 to 8.8 hours, 16 trials, 2024 participants, low level of evidence) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (reduction of 3.9 to 10.5 hours, 13 trials, 1888 participants, low level of evidence). However, these two fast-track care interventions were not associated with reduced total length of stay in the hospital (low level of evidence).


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Low-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia and time-directed extubation protocols for fast-track interventions have risks of mortality and major postoperative complications similar to those of conventional (not fast-track) care, and therefore appear to be safe for use in patients considered to be at low to moderate risk. These fast-track interventions reduced time to extubation and shortened length of stay in the intensive care unit but did not reduce length of stay in the hospital.",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2016.0,235,"{'url': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6457798?pdf=render', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/14651858.CD003587.pub3?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003587.pub3, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e71d09293c983f9148be7b2b1ae99b712cac5b23,Digital Rights and Mobile Health in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Protocol for a Scoping Review,"Background Digital technology is a means to uphold or violate human rights in various domains, including business, military, and health. Given the pervasiveness of mobile technology in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), mobile health (mHealth) interventions present an opportunity to reach remote populations and enable them to exercise civil and political rights and economic, social, and cultural rights, such as the right to health and education. Simultaneously, the ubiquity of mobile phones involves processing sensitive data which can threaten rights, including the right to privacy and nondiscrimination. Digital health is often promoted as advancing human rights and health equity; however, digital rights are underexplored in the literature on mHealth in LMICs. As such, creating an understanding of the digital rights topics covered in the 2022 literature is important to avoid exacerbating existing inequities relating to digital health design, use, implementation, and access. Objective This scoping review aims to identify digital rights topics in the 2022 peer-reviewed literature on mHealth in LMICs. Methods The Arksey and O’Malley framework for scoping reviews guides this review. Searches were performed across 7 electronic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, and PubMed). The screening processes were guided by the research question “What digital rights topics have been explored in the 2022 literature on mHealth in LMICs?” Only papers addressing mHealth in LMICs and digital rights topics were included. Data extraction will include publication title, year, and type; first author’s affiliation country; LMICs implicated; infrastructure challenges; study aims, design, limitations, and future work; health area; mHealth technology, functions, purpose or application, and target end users; human or digital right terms used; explicit rights topics cited; and implied rights topics. The results will be reported using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. Results This scoping review was registered in Open Science Framework (December 22, 2022). Title and abstract screening and full-text paper screening were completed in 2023. This resulted in 56 papers being included in the study. The target date for completing data extraction and publishing a case study of the initial findings is the end of 2023. The full scoping review findings are expected to be disseminated through various pathways benefiting academia, practice, and policy making by the end of 2024. These include journal papers, conference presentations, publicly available toolkits for research and practice, public webinars, and policy briefs with evidence-based policy recommendations emerging from this review. Conclusions The planned scoping review will identify digital rights topics in the 2022 literature at the intersection of mHealth and LMICs. Furthermore, it will highlight the importance of patient empowerment, data protection, and inclusion in mHealth research and related policies in LMICs.

fe2bf9e01495d23b630554b3272e45eda671b1de,Spontaneous Scaling of a Primary Care Innovation in Real-Life Conditions: Protocol for a Case Study,"Background Scaling effective primary care innovations to benefit more people is of interest to decision makers. However, we know little about how promising innovations are being scaled “spontaneously,” that is, without deliberate guidance. Objective We aim to observe, document, and analyze how, in real-life conditions, 1 primary care innovation spontaneously scales up across Quebec, Canada. Methods We will conduct a participative study using a descriptive single-case study. It will be guided by the McLean and Gargani principles for scaling and reported according to the COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) guidelines. Informed by an integrated knowledge translation approach, our steering committee will include patient users throughout the project. Inspired by the Quebec College of Family Physician’s “Dragons’ Den” primary care program, we will identify a promising primary care innovation that is being or will be scaled spontaneously. We will interview the innovation team about their scaling experiences every month for 1 year. We will conduct interviews and focus groups with decision makers, health care providers, and end users in the innovation team and the target site about their experience of both scaling and receiving the scaled innovation and document meetings as nonparticipant observers. Interview transcripts and documentary data will be analyzed to (1) compare the spontaneous scaling plan and implementation with the McLean and Gargani principles for scaling and (2) determine how it was consistent with or diverged from the 4 McLean and Gargani guiding principles: justification, optimal scale, coordination, and dynamic evaluation. Results This study was funded in March 2020 by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Recruitment began in November 2023 and data collection began in December 2023. Results are expected to be published in the first quarter of 2024. Conclusions Our study will advance the science of scaling by providing practical evidence–based material about scaling health and social care innovations in real-world settings using the 4 guiding principles of McLean and Gargani.

c5157c6dd51a53756c6a7509396e64ae5e45390c,Foreign language education in Louisiana: A cluster analysis,"Louisiana is currently the only state in the United States that requires foreign language (FL) study for some, but not all of their high school students, and these requirements are undergoing seismic changes. Considering that geographic, economic, and integration factors contribute to whether a school can provide FL at all—and biased counseling dissuades minoritized students from taking FL—this study asks: has FL education been equitably accessible to all Louisiana high school students who want to pursue it, regardless of race or economic background? To address this question, this paper presents results from two analyses. First, program‐internal equity variables (e.g., [dis]similarity between school‐wide and FL student demographics) were clustered to produce “profiles” of FL programs. Next, a multinomial logistic regression using program‐external factors (e.g., federal funding status, desegregation orders) was conducted to isolate the factors impacting equity. Federal funding and rurality were both found to be significant, with schools receiving federal Title I funds and rural schools being much more likely to exhibit inequitable access to FL courses. In (a) identifying schools with enrollment inequities and (b) the outside factors associated with greater inequity, this paper aims to provide policymakers with empirically based tools to address (in)equity in Louisiana high school FL education. These findings can be especially helpful in light of the state's recent (2023‐2024 school year) expansion of FL requirements to accept computer science courses.",Foreign language annals,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/flan.12737?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/flan.12737, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6077db0e71b4356d50812566a8df46c56ccb5b40,Stunting in Indonesian Children and Its Contributing Factors: Study through Bibliometric Analysis,"Children's stunting is a problem because it is associated with an increased risk of pain and death, suboptimal brain development resulting in late motor development, and inhibition of mental growth. This study aims to examine the factors that influence the occurrence of stunting and risk in children in Indonesia. The research method used is a traditional review. The results of the review found that many factors cause the high incidence of stunting in toddlers, including energy intake, birth weight, maternal knowledge level, family economic status, parental parenting, and food security. WHO estimates the prevalence of stunting worldwide at 22 percent or as many as 149.2 million in 2020. According to the Indonesian Nutritional Status Study (SSGI) results of the Ministry of Health, the prevalence of stunting in children under five in Indonesia reached 24.4% in 2021. The prevalence of stunting of toddlers in Indonesia continues to show a decline. In 2018 the prevalence of stunting toddlers was still 30.8%. Then, it dropped to 27.7 in 2019 and continued to fall to 24.4% in SSGI 2024. The government even targets to drop to 14% by the end of 2024. Furthermore, WHO also recommends reducing stunting by 3.9% per year to meet the target of 40% stunting reduction by 2025.

286b798d4b149f740527445e0d42cb96caf678fc,Triggerless data acquisition system for the AMBER experiment,"We developed a novel free-running data acquisition system for the AMBER experiment. The system features a hybrid architecture containing a scalable FPGA-based system for data collection and conventional distributed computing for data reduction. The current implementation can collect up to 10 GB/s sustained data rate. The FPGA system substitutes high-performance networks by merging time-correlated data and distribution between computers. The data reduction is performed by a filtering farm decreasing the incoming data rate by a factor of 50 to 100-200 MB/s. The filtering framework implements various data reduction algorithms for different physics programs. These algorithms perform partial data decoding, time, and spatial analysis of the data in order to select predefined event topology in a semi-online manner. Our system also performs continuous and iterative time calibration of detectors, which is required by the continuously running acquisition system. Additionally, we developed a simulation tool able to emulate detector responses to particles passing the AMBER spectrometer and convert them into correctly formatted raw data. These generated data are used to test and validate the readout chain and the filtering framework. The entire system will be tested with a limited number of detectors this year.

9df3c72454a5c5351455057f1ea3f1276c6b62a7,Introduction: Processes and Palaeo-Environmental Changes in the Arctic from Past to Present (PalaeoArc) special issue,"PalaeoArc (Processes and Palaeo-Environmental Changes in the Arctic: From Past to Present) is an international network research programme, the aim of which is to understand and explain the climatically induced environmental changes in the Arctic that have taken place throughout the Quaternary and continue in the present-day (see http://www.palaeoarc.no/). This network builds on and extends the impressive legacy of previous palaeo-Arctic network programs and projects extending back to the 1980s. This began with the “Polar North Atlantic Margins—Late Cenozoic Evolution” project (PONAM: 1990–1994; Hjort and Persson 1994; Landvik and Salvigsen 1995; Elverhøi et al. 1998), which was followed by the “Quaternary Environment of the Eurasian North” project (QUEEN: 1996–2002; e.g., Larsen, Funder, and Thiede 1999; Thiede et al. 2001, 2004; Kjær et al. 2006). These were then followed by the “Arctic Palaeoclimate and Its Extremes” project (APEX: 2004–2012; Jakobsson et al. 2008, 2010, 2014) and the “Palaeo-Arctic Spatial and Temporal Gateways” project (PAST Gateways: 2012–2018; Ó Cofaigh et al. 2016, 2018). The latest incarnation of the network—PalaeoArc— was conceived at the final meeting of the PAST Gateways project in Durham, UK, in April 2019, when a new international steering committee was appointed to organize a series of activities and annual conferences for the following six years (2019–2024). The new international network held its first meeting in Poznań (20– 24 May 2019), hosted by the Faculty of Geographical and Geological Sciences, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań (see Lyså et al. 2019), comprising the usual mix of talks, posters, discussions, workshops, and a field excursion. The network planned to organize a conference hosted by the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Pisa in May 2020, but this had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was eventually held online in May 2021, endorsed by the International Arctic Science Council, Italian Geological Society, and Italian Association for the Study of the Quaternary. The meeting proved incredibly popular and was “attended” by over 250 Arctic scientists from twenty-six different countries over a four-day period, allowing glacial and marine geologists, palaeoceanographers, palaeoecologists, and specialists in permafrost and numerical modeling to discuss records of Arctic environmental change over decadal to millennial timescales. The collection of articles in this special issue stems from this second PalaeoArc International Conference and encompasses the diverse range of topics presented at the meeting, each of which addresses the overarching aims of PalaeoArc (detailed below). The third international PalaeoArc conference took place (in person) in Rovaniemi in August 2022. The network has been extended for a year, with further meetings planned in Akureyri (2023), Stockholm (2024), and Tromsø (2025).","Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research",2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15230430.2022.2154985?needAccess=true&role=button', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/15230430.2022.2154985?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2022.2154985, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem-solving symposium, a collaborative initiative of the American Heart Association and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, was the first-ever annual multidisciplinary scientific forum focused on race/ethnic inequities in cerebrovascular disease, with the overarching goal of reducing inequities in stroke and accelerating the translation of research findings to improve outcomes for race/ethnic minorities. The symposium featured esteemed invited plenary speakers, lecturing on determinants of race/ethnic inequities in stroke and interventions aimed at redressing the inequities. The Edgar J. Kenton III Award recognized Ralph Sacco, MD, MS, for his lifetime contributions to investigation, management, mentorship, and community service in the field of stroke inequities. Early career investigators were provided with travel awards to attend the symposium; presented their research at moderated poster and Think Tank sessions; received career development advice at the Building Momentum session; and networked with experienced stroke inequities researchers. Future conferences-The Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem-solving 2021 to 2024-will broaden the focus to include 5 major persistent inequities (race/ethnic, sex, geographic, socioeconomic, and global). Each year will focus on a different theme (community and stakeholder engagement; clinical trials; implementation science; and policy and dissemination). By fostering a community of stroke inequities researchers, we hope to highlight promising work, illuminate research gaps, facilitate networking, inform policy makers, recognize achievement, inspire greater interest among junior investigators to pursue careers in this field, and provide networking opportunities for underrepresented minority scientists.",Stroke,2020.0,8,"{'url': 'https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030423', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030423?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030423, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Three years later, the Apollo programme ended. The longest time on the lunar surface? Three days. Relegated to low Earth orbit by mission and hardware, subsequent programmes – the US Space Shuttle and the International Space Station (ISS) – enabled impressive scientific strides (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018). We now understand much more about the conditions necessary for humans to thrive as planetary explorers. Thanks to the ISS, humans have been living continuously off of our planet for 19 years, the longest stay being 340 days. For this and future generations, a continuous human presence in space has become the norm. As a base for accumulating long duration exposure to the microgravity (free-fall) environment, the ISS program has helped physiologists define previously unrecognized risks. Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome is characterized by papilloedema and macular swelling that appears to be associated with persistent elevations in cephalad (and therefore capillary) hydrostatic pressure (Zhang & Hargens, 2018). Perhaps sharing a similar aetiology, thrombi have recently been documented in the jugular veins of some long-duration astronauts (Marshall-Goebel et al., 2019). Such findings suggest that restoration of venous pressure dynamics may need to become part of occupational health routines for future space workers. With lowearth orbit emerging as an innovationhub for the research and manufacturing sectors, we’re poised to leave low earth orbit with a renewed focus on exploration. The Artemis programme, announced by NASA last year, will place the first woman and the next man on the lunar surface in 2024 (National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, 2019). InGreekmythology,Artemis is the twin sisterofApollo. Thenameof the programme – like the composition of its crews – signifies a promise that space exploration will remain gender-inclusive. But the Artemis programmebears little resemblance to its Apollo predecessor. Enabled by the Space Launch System – the most powerful rocket ever created – and the Orion spacecraft – a joint American and European venture – Artemis will deliver tons of equipment to the vicinity of the Moon and eventually Mars. The first launch is less than a year away. In less than 10 years, women andmenwill live on theMoon for months at a time. Artemis will place a transfer station, or Gateway, in a near rectilinear halo orbit which is extremely stable in the vicinity of the Moon.
