b6efbb462178dea7402463d331135449c3ee1832,Integrating Computer Science across Wyomings K-12 Curriculum from Inception to Implementation: Analysis Using Systems Theory,"In 2001, the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled in State v. Campbell County that every Wyoming K-12 student has constitutional protection for a fair, complete, and equal education appropriate for the times. This protection results in the universal availability of a ""basket of goods,"" or a set of educational deliverables guaranteed to each student independent of the resources of individual school districts. In 2019, an executive action by Governor Matt Mead added to the deliverables ""the use and understanding of computer science."" His executive action initiated a system in which universal computer science became available to every Wyoming K-12 student by the 2022-2023 school year. The purpose of this paper is to use archival research methods through the lens of systems theory to explore the process of conceiving and implementing universal K-12 computer science education in Wyoming by considering the research question: How does systems theory provide a model for understanding Wyoming's universal K-12 computer science education delivery? Systems theory has been used to study organizational components and to analyze engineering systems since the 1950s, and a review of the literature indicates that many social systems can be understood through systems theory. However, using systems theory to study educational systems has not been studied in a comprehensive manner, resulting in a literature gap. This study analyzes how Wyoming's universal K-12 computer science delivery acts as a system. This paper provides recommendations from existing conditions to full availability, based on autopoiesis (the ability of a system to maintain itself) and summum bonum, or the ultimate good.",CoED,2023.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/b024-8d-49004?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/b024-8d-49004, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It expands and accelerates the exchange of ideas and commodities over vast distances. Regional economies, societies, and cultures have become integrated through a global network of communications, transportation, and computer technology. These have given impetus and make the world more interdependent than ever (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization). Globalization is no longer about trade in things that can be put in a box, but about trade in everything that can be digitalized. Digital technology makes everything simple. A big problem appears in a trade is distance, but it can be solved by using computer and internet connection. Sale and purchase transaction can be done by using computer with the Internet connection. Computer gives important contribution in globalization. Hornby (1995: 235) states that computer is an electronic device for strong and analyzing information fed into it, for calculating, or for controlling machinery automatically. Computer is used in vary of field and computer also used in instruction. Computer used in instruction provides virtually instantaneous response to the students input, has extensive capacity to store and manipulate information, and is unmatched in its ability to serve many individual students simultaneously. It has the ability to control and integrate a wide variety of media – still pictures, graphics, and moving images, as well as printed information. The computer can also record, analyze, and react to students’ responses that are typed on a keyboard or selected with a mouse (Heinich, 1996: 228).",JUPE : Jurnal Pendidikan Mandala,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.58258/jupe.v8i1.4887', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.58258/jupe.v8i1.4887?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.58258/jupe.v8i1.4887, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

de81352789c75598a7d1d2ab5545e122e64de2cc,Predictive Analytics Model for Optimizing Carbon Footprint From Students’ Learning Activities in Computer Science-Related Majors,"Global warming poses a significant challenge to environmental sustainability due to the high greenhouse gas emissions originating from human activities. Among the various sectors contributing to these emissions, the education sector, particularly at the university level, plays a crucial role in generating carbon footprints. While several studies have examined carbon footprints within universities, few have focused on understanding the behavior and activities of individuals. Statistics show that students are the primary contributors to carbon emissions in higher education. Despite the availability of various methods for calculating carbon emissions, limited studies have utilized such data to predict future trends. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a predictive analytics model that leveraged students’ learning activities as a significant factor to predict future trends in university carbon emissions. Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) was used as a case study, especially computer science-related majors. The carbon emission calculation utilized a formula that incorporated various emission sources, including electricity, transportation, and paper consumption. In the 2022/2023 academic year, ITB generated 612.8 tons of CO $_{2}\text{e}$ . The prediction modeling employed the SVR algorithm and utilized historical data, such as carbon emissions from the last 30 days, and external information, such as weather, event-related data, and university data. The model’s performance was evaluated using metrics, yielding values of 129.41 for MAE, 158.03 for RMSE, 0.98 for R2, and 15.83 for MAPE. The results provided insights for universities to assess their carbon footprint and raised awareness among the academic community, supporting decision-making to optimize carbon emissions at the students’ level.",IEEE Access,2023.0,7,"{'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/10285846.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3324725?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3324725, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

44a798982b1d1de1471fc048e3a2447eeea93116,Student Attitudes During the Pilot of the Computer Science Frontiers Course,"Motivation. We have created a modular project-based learning curriculum, Computer Science Frontiers (CSF) [1, 8], for secondary students in attempts to increase the persistence of computer science (CS) students in higher education. The CSF course is divided into four different modules (Distributed Computing, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering), each centered around a topic typically introduced to students only in higher education. Using the block-based programming environment NetsBlox [4], students are able to access various Application Programming Interfaces related to their interests [2, 3]. The goal of this course is to increase student interest in CS during high school - when first career choices occur [7] - in hopes they will persist in CS during their undergraduate studies. Research question. The research question for this study was: How does the Computer Science Frontiers course affect student attitudes towards computer science? Research Methods. We conducted over 20 interviews with students throughout a CSF pilot course that took place over the 2022-2023 school year. Interviews were conducted with at least five students at the end of every module. Two researchers have conducted thematic analysis with student responses from the first two modules [5]: Distributed Computing (DC) and Internet of Things (IoT). First, the two researchers developed a norm by tagging one interview together [6]. Next, the researchers independently coded the rest of the interviews for each module. After completing a single module’s interviews, the researchers met to rectify any discrepancies. Finally, the tags were grouped together based on common themes. Through this process, we found a total of seven themes. Results. The themes found through thematic analysis include: computer science, attitudes towards course, student wants, student struggles, attitudes towards projects, collaboration, and student progression. As a result of this study, we have identified different needs for secondary students with varying background in CS when studying more advanced CS topics, such as IoT. For example, a need of students who have less prior CS knowledge than others may be to review programming concepts in order to be successful in the course. We have also identified a positive change in student’s attitudes towards computer science after the first two modules. These insights provide the CS education community with ways to engage students with concepts that they have not been exposed to and how to increase their interest in CS. Implications. The CSF curriculum is currently online, and is available to computer science instructors. Each module is separated into eight to nine units which are accompanied by activities and teaching guides. This curriculum provides educators with materials and activities to introduce students to more advanced CS topics, either through individual modules or as an entire course. In future research, we plan to use CSF in an outreach program and implement the course in two secondary classrooms in the 2023-2024 school year.",International Computing Education Research Workshop,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3568812.3603483?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3568812.3603483, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

61372faa71db32532fc535e9eecfbf25d46d9664,The potential of large language models for improving probability learning: A study on ChatGPT3.5 and first-year computer engineering students,"In this paper, we assess the efficacy of ChatGPT (version Feb 2023), a large-scale language model, in solving probability problems typically presented in introductory computer engineering exams. Our study comprised a set of 23 probability exercises administered to students at Rey Juan Carlos University (URJC) in Madrid. The responses produced by ChatGPT were evaluated by a group of five statistics professors, who assessed them qualitatively and assigned grades based on the same criteria used for students. Our results indicate that ChatGPT surpasses the average student in terms of phrasing, organization, and logical reasoning. The model's performance remained consistent for both the Spanish and English versions of the exercises. However, ChatGPT encountered difficulties in executing basic numerical operations. Our experiments demonstrate that requesting ChatGPT to provide the solution in the form of an R script proved to be an effective approach for overcoming these limitations. In summary, our results indicate that ChatGPT surpasses the average student in solving probability problems commonly presented in introductory computer engineering exams. Nonetheless, the model exhibits limitations in reasoning around certain probability concepts. The model's ability to deliver high-quality explanations and illustrate solutions in any programming language, coupled with its performance in solving probability exercises, suggests that large language models have the potential to serve as learning assistants.",arXiv.org,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05686', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05686, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f08213f8839663bb5b197d4ac23afc20b842014a,29th NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC PRACTICAL CONFERENCE “NATURAL SCIENCE EDUCATION IN A COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL – 2023”: CONFERENCE REVIEW,"This year, the scientific conference ""Natural Science Education in a Comprehensive School - 2023"" was held in its usual format. It is worth mentioning that during the Covid-19 pandemic, three conferences were held remotely, in 2020, 2021 and 2022.
This two-day conference focused on science and technology education, which is a recent priority in society. There is a need to improve the teaching of science subjects and technology at all levels of general education. Particular attention should be paid to early science education. Ensuring adequate science and technology education means providing children with an education that teaches them to reason, think logically, explore, be creative and active. 
The plenary session of the conference was international and very interesting. A total of four keynote speeches were presented during this session. It is clear that the Plenary ""bridged"" different continents - Africa, Latin America, Europe. Professor Andris Broks discussed systemic issues in science and technology education, with a particular focus on the major challenges and changes of the present. Speakers from South Africa and Brazil shared their experiences in organising research activities for future teachers. Experiences from both countries in the training of science teachers were explored. The plenary also discussed developments in science education in the updated General Curricula in Lithuania. 
Informal discussions at the conference focused on educational experiences during the pandemic. All participants acknowledged that education in a pandemic is significantly more difficult. This is especially true for various non-formal education activities, or activities that take place outside the regular classroom (e.g. various project activities, research activities, etc.).
Participants, especially those who are more or less regular attendees, stressed the importance of a ""live"" meeting. After all, informal communication has the main purpose of enabling a person to understand and be understood. This cannot be achieved in an online (remote) conference. It was hoped that the work of the conference would continue.
Most conference reports were presented in the form of articles and published in the conference proceedings. One can find full texts in the database at: https://oaji.net/journal-archive-stats.html?number=1984&year=2023&issue=20002

The subject of the study was the articles with the keywords «Ukraine» and «war» in the title in the international scientometric databases Scopus and Web of Sciences for the year 2023. It was noted that in quantitative terms, in the last two years, precisely because of large-scale hostilities on the territory of the country, interest in Ukrainian studies has increased sharply. It is considered from favorable positions for our country, precisely as «war», «invasion», «aggression», but not «conflict» or «crisis». Unlike domestic publications, which are mostly devoted to internal issues, the authors of foreign articles focus their attention on the external effects of the Russian-Ukrainian war in a broad socio-economic and geopolitical context. The largest specific weight is made up of publications on media topics. The review of military aspects is limited to a discussion of the use of aviation, small drones, and the possibility of nuclear escalation. Most of the few articles, the subject of which can be attributed to the field of culture, are related to the such topics as: a) art, b) national identity, c) cultural policy and cultural heritage, which are also published by domestic authors in specialized Ukrainian journals on cultural studies. Instead, the topic of «women and war» is considered much more broadly. However, so far there are no attempts to conceptualize the essence and limits of the new socio-cultural reality, the formation of which was created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

2a5b408d3c43db9f51f54012ef4d8c451f469b71,Preface: 5th International Conference on Management Science and Innovative Education (MSIE 2023),"The 5th International Conference on Management Science and Innovative Education (MSIE 2023) was held from November 25-26, 2023 in Singapore. This conference was sponsored by Research Center of Engineering and Science, and was attended by academicians, researchers, entrepreneurs, government agencies and policy-makers, postgraduates from China and all over the world. 
The aim of MSIE 2023 is to provide a platform for educators, scholars, managers and graduate students from different cultural backgrounds to present and discuss research, developments and innovations in the fields of Social Science. It provides opportunities for the delegates to exchange new ideas and application experiences, to establish business or research relations and to find global partners for future collaboration. 
MSIE 2023 has received 87 manuscripts. By submitting a paper to MSIE 2023, the authors agree to the review process and understand that papers undergo a peer-review process. Manuscripts will be reviewed by appropriately qualified experts in the field selected by the Conference Committee, who will give detailed comments and-if the submission gets accepted-the authors submit a revised version that takes into account this feedback. All papers are reviewed using a double-blind review process: authors declare their names and affiliations in the manuscript for the reviewers to see, but reviewers do not know each other's identities, nor do the authors receive information about who has reviewed their manuscript. The Committees of MSIE invest great efforts in reviewing the papers submitted to the conference and organizing the sessions to enable the participants to gain maximum benefit. 
Hopefully, all participants and other interested readers benefit scientifically from the proceedings and also find it stimulating in the process. We look forward to the exciting moments of the 6th International Conference on Management Science and Innovative Education next year.

207d445d4908fe4b922ed4a3752621e3fce5a352,Ten new insights in climate science 2023,"Abstract Non-technical summary We identify a set of essential recent advances in climate change research with high policy relevance, across natural and social sciences: (1) looming inevitability and implications of overshooting the 1.5°C warming limit, (2) urgent need for a rapid and managed fossil fuel phase-out, (3) challenges for scaling carbon dioxide removal, (4) uncertainties regarding the future contribution of natural carbon sinks, (5) intertwinedness of the crises of biodiversity loss and climate change, (6) compound events, (7) mountain glacier loss, (8) human immobility in the face of climate risks, (9) adaptation justice, and (10) just transitions in food systems. Technical summary The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports provides the scientific foundation for international climate negotiations and constitutes an unmatched resource for researchers. However, the assessment cycles take multiple years. As a contribution to cross- and interdisciplinary understanding of climate change across diverse research communities, we have streamlined an annual process to identify and synthesize significant research advances. We collected input from experts on various fields using an online questionnaire and prioritized a set of 10 key research insights with high policy relevance. This year, we focus on: (1) the looming overshoot of the 1.5°C warming limit, (2) the urgency of fossil fuel phase-out, (3) challenges to scale-up carbon dioxide removal, (4) uncertainties regarding future natural carbon sinks, (5) the need for joint governance of biodiversity loss and climate change, (6) advances in understanding compound events, (7) accelerated mountain glacier loss, (8) human immobility amidst climate risks, (9) adaptation justice, and (10) just transitions in food systems. We present a succinct account of these insights, reflect on their policy implications, and offer an integrated set of policy-relevant messages. This science synthesis and science communication effort is also the basis for a policy report contributing to elevate climate science every year in time for the United Nations Climate Change Conference.

0dce2dedbc607bc990a84d2294b4c99aabee7853,Chest CT Lung Abnormalities 1 Year after COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background Radiological lung sequelae may explain the persistence of respiratory complaints in post-COVID-19 condition (long-COVID). Purpose To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and type of COVID-19 residual lung abnormalities at 1-year chest CT. Materials and Methods A literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Medline databases was performed from January 2020 to January 2023. Full-text reports of CT lung sequelae in adults (≥18 years) with confirmed COVID-19 at 1-year follow-up were included. The prevalence of any residual lung abnormality and type (fibrotic or not) was analyzed according to the Fleischner Glossary. The meta-analysis included studies with chest CT data assessable in no less than 80% of individuals. A random-effects model was used to estimate pooled prevalence. Multiple sub-group (country, journal category, methodological quality, study setting, outcomes) and meta-regression analyses were performed to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. I2 statistics estimated low (25%), moderate (26-50%) and high (>50%) heterogeneity. 95% Prediction Intervals (95% PIs) were computed to describe the expected estimates range. Results Of 22 709 records, 21 studies were reviewed (20 prospective, 9 from China, and 7 in radiology journals). The meta-analysis included 14 studies with chest CT data in 1854 of 2043 individuals (M/F: 1109/934). Estimates of lung sequelae were highly heterogeneous (7.1-96.7%), with a pooled frequency of 43.5% (I2=94%; 95% PI: 5.9%, 90.4%). This also applied to single non-fibrotic changes, including ground glass opacity, consolidations, nodules/masses, parenchymal bands, and reticulations. The prevalence range of fibrotic traction bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis was 1.6-25.7% (I2=93%; 95% PI: 0.0%, 98.6%;); honeycombing was unremarkable (0-1.1%; I2=58%; 95% PI: 0%, 60%). Lung sequelae were unrelated to any characteristics of interest. Conclusion The prevalence of COVID-19 lung sequelae at 1-year chest CT is highly heterogeneous among studies. Heterogeneity determinants remain unknown suggesting caution in data interpretation with no convincing evidence.

The goal of this study was to use imaging biomarkers of disc biochemical composition to distinguish degenerative changes associated with cLBP from normal aging. Methods T1ρ MRI data were acquired from 133 prospectively enrolled subjects for this observational study (80 cLBP, 53 controls; mean ± SD age = 43.9 ± 13.4 years; 61 females, 72 males). The mean T1ρ relaxation time in the nucleus pulposus (NP-T1ρ; n = 650 discs) was used as a quantitative biomarker of disc biochemical composition. Linear regression was used to assess associations between NP-T1ρ and age, sex, spinal level, and study group, and their interactions. Results NP-T1ρ values were lower in cLBP patients than controls (70.8 ± 22.8 vs. 76.4 ± 22.2 ms, p = 0.009). Group differences were largest at L5–S1 (ΔT1ρ_cLBP-control = −11.3 ms, p  < 0.0001), representing biochemical deterioration typically observed over a 9–12 year period (NP-T1ρ declined by 0.8–1.1 ms per year [95% CI]). Group differences were large in younger patients and diminished with age. Finally, the age-dependence of disc degeneration was stronger in controls than cLBP patients. Conclusion Aging effects on the biochemical composition of the L5–S1 disc may involve a relatively uniform set of factors from which many cLBP patients deviate. NP-T1ρ values at L5–S1 may be highly relevant to clinical phenotyping, particularly in younger individuals.",European spine journal,2023.0,4,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00586-023-07542-6.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10205694, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4b25e1ea1447430dbe9bba5982dc1e69b2e5a78f,"Year of sustainability, openness, and new roles: A Ukrainian university library in wartime","One year of russia’s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine to seize its territory and destroy the Ukrainian people as a nation, its language, culture, scientific achievements, and educational traditions have demonstrated the incredible adaptability of universities and their libraries. This paper aims to analyze the administrative aspect of the urgent adaptation of library teams of Ukrainian higher education institutions to martial law conditions in the example of the Scientific Library of the Ukrainian State University of Science and Technologies (USUST). The paper considers the experience of survival, resilience, and adaptation of the USUST library to the war, which can be extrapolated to other libraries of Ukrainian higher education institutions. In addition, the study comparatively analyzes quantitative indicators of five university libraries as of January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2023. The main vectors of library activity are distance, openness, unification, and improvement of the single information space. The primary motivating factors for librarians’ resilience and adaptation to wartime working conditions are belief in the Armed Forces and the victory of Ukraine. The study emphasizes the importance of university libraries’ support of open educational resources as one of the methods of overcoming the Ukrainian linguocide. Library directors in wartime, with predominantly female staff, note the impact of psychological factors on their professional activities. Despite the threatening trends, libraries continue to support educational and scientific processes in their universities, launching new directions of activity.",Problems and Perspectives in Management,2023.0,7,"{'url': 'https://www.businessperspectives.org/images/pdf/applications/publishing/templates/article/assets/17991/PPM_2023_02(si)_Kolesnykova.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21511/ppm.21(2-si).2023.14?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21511/ppm.21(2-si).2023.14, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Objective: Since the inception of three-dimensional printing (3DP), various studies have been conducted worldwide to investigate the utilization of 3DP in craniomaxillofacial (CMF) surgery. Analyzing the current state of global research in medical 3DP in CMF surgery is a crucial first step in identifying knowledge gaps and focusing research resources on pressing problems that have not yet been addressed. Therefore, the current study was designed to present a comprehensive review of scientific research data to discover trends in the last 30 years of global research on 3DP in CMF surgery. Methods: All publications from 1994 until 14 February 2023 were retrieved from the core collection of Web of Science using a defined search. Detailed bibliographic data for all retrieved publications were collected. The bibliometric analysis was performed using VOS viewer, Histcite, and Microsoft Excel. Results: A total of 1367 evaluable articles were retrieved. Results showed that although there is an exponential increase in the number of publications related to 3DP in CMF surgery, there is a substantial regionalization of research, with the U.S.A. and China being the most significant contributors to the retrieved articles. It was also observed that there is a scarcity of published literature related to bioprinting in CMF surgery. Conclusion: This is the first study that specifically analyzed the published literature concerning 3DP in CMF surgery in a structured quantitative manner. The study found a concentration of research in specific geographies and indicated a need for more diversified research in this field. The study also identified a need for public sector involvement in such research to aid in the further dissemination of knowledge.",Craniomaxillofacial Research &amp; Innovation,2023.0,8,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/27528464231170964?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/27528464231170964, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aims to evaluate the scientific activity related to this complication through a bibliometric analysis. The search was performed on a single day, 23 January 2023, to ensure the inclusion of all articles and to avoid bias caused by the daily updates of the open access database. The data were recovered from Web of Science. The sample comprised a total of 1596 publications that met the inclusion criteria. The United States was the country with the largest number of publications, citations, and international cooperation with respect to phlebitis and vascular access. The most important author was Rickard CM. Of all the publications selected, a total of 1586 (99.37%) were original articles. The highest number of articles on the subject was recorded in 2021, and the most common research areas were General Internal Medicine and Nursing. The analysis of the clusters (KeyWords Plus and Author keywords) and co-occurrences enabled identification of areas of interest and their possible development. These areas included the prevention, risk, and associated complications of catheter-associated phlebitis. Other aspects that are a priori relevant, such as assessment and treatment, were found to be little investigated. While research on this subject is increasing internationally, more collaborations are still required between researchers, as well as new approaches related to the management of catheter-associated phlebitis. The dimensions that should continue to be considered in new research, according to the findings of this review, are instruments for phlebitis assessment and their validation, and the treatments to follow in the case of established phlebitis.

06a3edaece013e3c7dfded937cae57c711e3ff93,Over 40 years (1981–2023) assessing stigma with the Community Attitudes to Mental Illness (CAMI) scale: a systematic review of its psychometric properties,"Background The Community Attitudes to Mental Illness (CAMI) scale measures social stigma towards people with mental illness. Although it has been used worldwide, the psychometric properties of the CAMI have not been systematically reviewed. The main aim of this study was to systematically review the psychometric properties of the different versions of the CAMI more than 40 years after of its publication. Methods A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and EMBASE from 1981 (year of publication) to 2023 (present). A double review was performed for eligibility, data extraction, and quality assessment. Results A total of 15 studies enrolling 10,841 participants were included. The most frequently reported factor structure comprises 3 or 4 factors. Overall, the internal consistency seems adequate for the global scale ( α  ≥ 0.80), except for CAMI-10 ( α  = 0.69). Internal consistency of the subscales are not supported, with authoritarianism being the weakest factor ( α  = 0.27 to 0.68). The stability over time of the total scale has been assessed in the CAMI-40, CAMI-BR, and CAMI-10 ( r  ≥ 0.39). Few studies have assessed the temporal stability of the CAMI subscales. Most of the correlations with potentially related measures are significant and in the expected direction. Conclusions The 3 and 4 factor structure are the most widely reported in the different versions of the CAMI. Even though reliability and construct validity are acceptable, further item refinement by international consensus seems warranted more than 40 years after the original publication.

Utilization of multiple choice questions serves as a data collection method in the realm of the eleventh grade English course, especially with regard to Personal Correspondence subject matter. Initial and successive iteration of evaluations have the potential to provide in-depth discernment while scrutinizing student progress. The scientific findings from the student experiment showed a noteworthy increase from cycle I to cycle II, with a sizable jump from 58.06% to 93.55%. Empirical evidence suggests that involvement in TGT may have the capacity to enhance one's personal aptitude for understanding English. Eleventh graders of Science 1 SMA Negeri 1 West Malaka have succeeded in carrying out an innovative approach to English mastery pedagogy that is in line with the prescribed protocol.","PROSIDING SEMINAR NASIONAL PENDIDIKAN, BAHASA, SASTRA, SENI, DAN BUDAYA",2023.0,5,"{'url': 'https://badanpenerbit.org/index.php/MATEANDRAU/article/download/267/243', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.55606/mateandrau.v2i1.267?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.55606/mateandrau.v2i1.267, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation plays an important role in the progression of aortic aneurysm. However, there is a lack of literature-based quantitative analysis in this field. Methods Up to March 30, 2023, we collected 3,993 articles related to aortic aneurysm and inflammation from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database for bibliometric analysis. The collected literature data were subjected to visual analysis of regional distribution, institutions, authors, keywords, and other information using tools such as CiteSpace, VOSviewer, the R package “bibliometric,” and online platforms. Results The number of publications in this research field has been steadily increasing each year, with the United States and China being the main contributing countries. Harvard University in the United States emerged as the most active and influential research institution in this field. Jonathan Golledge and Peter Libby were identified as the authors with the highest publication output and academic impact, respectively. Researchers in this field tend to publish their findings in influential journals such as the Journal of Vascular Surgery and Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology. “Abdominal aortic aneurysm,” “giant cell arteritis,” “arterial stiffness,” and “smooth muscle cells” were identified as the hottest topics in the field of aortic aneurysm and inflammation. In terms of keyword co-occurrence analysis, “Clinical relevant studies of AA“ (red), “Inflammatory activation” (green), “Inflammatory mechanisms related to pathogenesis” (dark blue), “Cytokines” (yellow), “Risk factors” (purple), and “Pathological changes in vascular wall” (cyan) formed the major research framework in this field. “Inflammation-related pathogenesis” and “inflammation activation” have emerged as recent hot research directions, with “monocytes,” “progression,” and “proliferation” being the prominent topics. Conclusion This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the knowledge network framework and research hotspots in the field of aortic aneurysm and inflammation through a literature-based quantitative approach.

Looking back at 2022, KJR experienced a significant increase in the two-year journal impact factor (JIF), published annually by Clarivate Analytics, from 3.5 to 7.109, which may be the first (if not the most important) thing that comes to mind of many people. Unlike its name, JIF has multiple pitfalls as an index of a journal’s impact [1]. Furthermore, JIF is not the only metric of scholarly citations as several other related indices exist, such as CiteScore [2], Scimago Journal Rank [3], and h-index [4]. Nevertheless, in general, authors still strongly consider JIF when determining where to submit their research studies [5]. Similar to KJR, substantial increases in JIF were noted across numerous journals in various fields of medicine and science, including radiology, infectious diseases, respiratory medicine, general/internal medicine, etc. While the increase in JIF may be attributed to various factors, it cannot be denied that a substantial fraction was due to the number of studies on COVID-19, as they affected acutely and massively scholarly publications and citations [5-14].

21babe6c81ec59ece6a5fdf4868b459340a7b496,"Owen Gingerich, 1930–2023","We regret to inform our readers of the death of Owen Gingerich, the distinguished astronomer and historian of astronomy, on May 28, 2023. Owen was a long-standing member of the Journal’s editorial team and he served as reviews editor for more than three decades (1973–2007). Owen was professor emeritus of astronomy and of the history of science at Harvard University and an astronomer emeritus at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Owen was born in Washington, Iowa, to Verna Roth-Gingerich and Melvin Gingerich, members of Mennonite communities. Owen’s father was a high school teacher, who completed a Ph.D. in history when Owen was about 8 years old. After a period of insecurity and frequent moves, his father landed at job at Bethel College, a Mennonite institution in North Newton, Kansas. There Owen attended the first 3 years of high school, where he developed an interest in journalism and had an inspiring chemistry teacher. In 1947, before Owen’s senior year, his father moved to a new job at Goshen College, another Mennonite liberal arts college in Goshen, Indiana. In an unusual arrangement, even for the time, Owen skipped his last year of high school and matriculated at Goshen College. As Owen said in a 2005 oral history interview with David DeVorkin, “I skipped my senior year and did not graduate from high school until a year ago [i.e., 2004], when I was finally given an honorary degree by the Newton, Kansas School Board.”1 When he was about nine, his father helped him build a telescope from a mailing tube and purchased lenses. And his father’s interest in photography gave him the chance to learn some darkroom work. In high school, Owen built a more serious telescope, for which he ground his own mirror. He used this for a few years with a cardboard tube but then moved over to an open framework (Figure 1). In his junior year of college he wrote an article about telescope construction for a Mennonite weekly aimed at young people.2 At Goshen College, Owen majored in chemistry but continued also to pursue his interest in journalism, becoming editor of the student newspaper. Upon joining the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), headquartered at the Harvard College Observatory, Gingerich wrote Harlow Shapley, HCO Director and one of America’s best known astronomers, to ask whether he might work as a summer intern at the Observatory. Shapley, also from the Midwest and with a strong journalistic background, agreed and Owen spent the summer of 1948 at Shapley’s beck and call, fetching plates3 and breathing the astronomical air in Cambridge. The following summer he returned, this time to a job at Sky & Telescope, housed at the HCO and formed in 1941 by the merger of The Sky and The Telescope. These experiences seem to have won him for astronomy—for he had previously had no idea that one could make money at astronomy as an undergraduate. His connection with Sky & Telescope proved to be 1195409 JHA0010.1177/00218286231195409Journal for the History of Astronomy obituary2023",Journal for the History of Astronomy,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/00218286231195409?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/00218286231195409, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Prevention and control of dog-transmitted rabies require mapping the level of understanding, perception, and existing practices to minimize its impacts on health. Therefore, we undertook this systematic review and meta-analysis to pool evidence from available data on knowledge, attitudes, and prevention practices regarding the disease from studies conducted in various areas of Ethiopia. Methods Articles were searched in electronic bibliographic medical databases such as the Excerpta Medica database, PubMed, Web of Science, African Journals Online, Google Scholar, and Scopus. We used Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and STATA software version 16 for the data excerption and analysis, respectively. The variability among studies was evaluated via Higgins and Thompson’s I2 statistics and the x2 test (significant at p ≤ 0.1). The Dersimonian and Laird random-effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate the pooled effect at a 95% uncertainty interval (UI). Visual inspection and Egger’s test (significant at p ≤ 0.05) were used to identify the presence of small-study effects. Results The search identified 1,249 electronic records. Of them, 27 studies involving 11,150 participants met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of a good level of knowledge was 62.24% (95% UI: 48.56, 75.92). Furthermore, the pooled prevalence of a favorable level of attitudes towards rabies and a good level of rabies prevention practices was only 56.73% (95% UI: 47.16, 66.29) and 52.73% (95% UI: 43.32, 62.15), respectively. Conclusion The study revealed credible gaps in attitudes and prevention practices, though some level of knowledge about dog-mediated rabies was demonstrated.

70810edeee3e0cde306af926ddf7088f81759822,Research trends of Janus Kinase inhibitors: a bibliometric and visualized study from 2012 to 2023.,"OBJECTIVE
Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been extensively evaluated for their potential in the management of various diseases. Despite previous research on this topic, there is a lack of bibliometric analysis that summarizes research trends on JAK inhibitors. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the top 100 most frequently cited studies on JAK inhibitors over the last ten years.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Web of Science database was used to screen and extract relevant studies on JAK inhibitors. The top 100 studies most cited within the JAK inhibitor-related research were identified and evaluated, and various data such as the year of publication, study focus and keywords, author information, and number of citations were extracted and analyzed for further examination.


RESULTS
In the top 100 most cited studies of JAK inhibitors, more than 70% of studies focused on the role of JAK inhibitors in disease treatments, with 42% of these studies focused on using JAK inhibitors as treatment for autoimmune diseases and 19 of them focused on the treatment of neoplasms. Time trend analysis revealed that the keywords ""tofacitinib"", ""atopic dermatitis"", and ""rheumatoid arthritis"" were widely mentioned in 2016, while new trends emerged in 2018, with ""ruxolitinib"" and ""baricitinib"" being more commonly mentioned.


CONCLUSIONS
The top 100 most frequently cited studies on JAK inhibitors focused primarily on the safety and efficacy of these inhibitors in the management of various diseases, particularly inflammatory diseases and neoplasms. The results can serve as a valuable reference for rheumatologists and immunologists interested in the development of JAK inhibitors and expanding future research fields.",European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences,2023.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.26355/eurrev_202312_34807?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202312_34807, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The goal of this machine learning/data science challenge is to recognize eight locomotion and transportation activities (Still, Walk, Run, Bike, Bus, Car, Train, Subway) from the motion (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) and GPS (GPS location, GPS reception) sensor data of a smartphone in a user-independent manner. The training data of a “train” user is available from smartphones placed at four body positions (Hand, Torso, Bag and Hips). The testing data originates from “test” users with a smartphone placed at one, but unknown, body position. We introduce the dataset used in the challenge and the protocol of the competition. We present a meta-analysis of the contributions from 15 submissions, their approaches, the software tools used, computational cost and the achieved results. The challenge evaluates the recognition performance by comparing predicted to ground-truth labels at every 10 milliseconds, but puts no constraints on the maximum decision window length. Overall, five submissions achieved F1 scores above 90%, three between 80% and 90%, two between 70% and 80%, three between 50% and 70%, and two below 50%. While the task this year is facing the technical challenges of sensor unavailability, irregular sampling, and sensor diversity, the overall performance based on GPS and motion sensors is better than previous years (e.g. the best performance reported in SHL 2020, 2021 and 2023 are 88.5%, 75.4% and 96.0%, respectively). This is possibly due to the complementary between the GPS and motion sensors and also the removal of constraints on the decision window length.

Telkom University has a Center for e-Learning and Open Education (CeLOE) LMS which is a platform for student learning when online classes. However, the achievement of student learning outcomes has not yet been achieved maximum. This research uses process mining algorithms, specifically the process cube, to analyze event log data from CeLOE LMS. The formulation of the problem of this research itself includes the pattern of student learning path, the best pattern in achieving learning outcomes in the Accounting and Management Systems course Finance as well as Business Process Engineering course, and the performance of the teaching process for lecturers. The purpose of this research is to find out activity pattern student learning, find the best patterns in achieving learning outcomes, and evaluate teaching process performance. This research has limitations on the data obtained from odd semester 2022/2023 and even 2021/2022 and focus on second year students of Information Systems. The research results show that students need to do activities such as doing assignments, attending virtual meetings, doing quizzes, and accessing material learning to achieve pass status, while students who fail just do view action only on the activity. It is important for students to do assignments and quizzes well. In the course Accounting Systems and Management Finance as well as Business Process Engineering, the best pattern of learning includes doing assignments and quizzes simultaneously in appropriate time. This research provides benefit for science, research objects (second year students of Information Systems), and writers itself.

7c888cde24fcceb85fd8e3551da6291b995e399b,2023 Jessberger Award to Jamie Elsila,"I am delighted to introduce Jamie Elsila as the recipient of this year’s Jessberger Award. I met Jamie after she returned from service in the Peace Corps in Tanzania between college and graduate school, where she taught chemistry and math. She visited NASA Ames with Society Fellow Scott Sandford where she had done undergraduate research and published her first paper (Elsila et al., 1997) (Figure 1). I was a post-doc and had the pleasure of working with her when she was a graduate student with Dick Zare where she had her first meteoritic publication 20 years ago (Plows et al., 2003) and received her PhD in 2004. As large cuts to NASA’s astrobiology program were being proposed in 2006, Society Nier Prize winner, Danny Glavin and I had the fortune to get funding for a new isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Figure 2) as well as a hiring point for a civil servant scientist to join our laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center for compound-specific isotope measurements needed to firmly establish the origin of amino acids detected in meteorites and in samples returned from comet Wild 2 by the Stardust mission. As a senior post-doc at that same laboratory at Ames, Jamie had modest experience with stable isotope work but a keen interest in astrobiology and extraterrestrial organic chemistry. I encouraged her to apply; she did and was hired as the top candidate. Then, as now, she can master a new topic and became expert at the challenging field of compound-specific isotope measurements of trace organics in extraterrestrial samples. In particular, the analysis of amino acids in Stardust foil extracts proved to be extremely difficult. Interferences with the chemical derivatization method used for the analyses due to borate contamination from the aerogel, the low abundances of the amino acid and amine targets in the samples, coupled with the loss of amino acid precursors from the foils over time in curation, all needed to be overcome to make the challenging measurement. After years of instrument optimization, she was able to spot the signature of extraterrestrial C to make the first detection of an amino acid, glycine, derived from a comet (Elsila et al., 2009). It is heartening to know that the same compound was observed in the coma of 67P/ChuryumovGerasimenko by Rosetta’s ROSINA instrument many years later (Altwegg et al., 2016; Hadraoui et al., 2019). The mechanism of glycine formation at 67P was further investigated by the COSIMA instrument, which of course Elmar Jessberger contributed to developing (Kissel et al., 2007). Jamie is an expert in the analysis of meteoritic soluble organic compounds, having built a strong and successful research program in this area over the past decade. Her research in this area focuses on understanding the abundances, distributions, and stable isotopic composition of soluble organic compounds, and interpreting this information to answer important questions about the origin of these molecules and their potential astrobiological and astrochemical contributions to the Solar System. Her meticulous and systematic approach includes the search for bias in sample workup as well as the analysis. For example, she performed the first analysis of the H, C, and N stable isotopes of the same amino acids from the same extract from a range of CM and CR meteorites (Elsila et al., 2012). This finally eliminated the complication of different extractions, different methods, different instruments often invoked to explain conflicting results. She has generated the most extensive published studies of isotopic composition of various soluble organic compounds in carbonaceous chondrites to create a database used by the community in interpreting astrochemical reactions. She collaborates with modelers to use these new results to examine models for extraterrestrial chemical reactions, thereby FIGURE 1.

339c3dc9fbf639818e757009229454ba0880bfa6,Editorial for interactive learning environments August 2023 vol 31,"Thinking about metrics and quality. This journal is receiving record numbers of submissions from academics across the globe, which is great news; the editorial team is increasing its review work and has been expanded, and the metrics are looking strong. Over the last year, the journal had 655,000 downloads/views, though this only relates to articles read via Taylor & Francis online, as open-access articles can be read via a subject or institutional repository. There are varying metrics to review if readers and authors are looking for a way to judge quality, both at article level (citations on Web of Science, CrossRef and Scopus as well as Altmetric Attention Score) and journal level, such as Impact Factor over 2–5 years, Impact Score, h-index, SNIP, CiteScore and SCImago Journal Rank. But to what extent do these metrics help you decide a journal’s quality? They can give an indication, but there is much more to explore before making a choice of which journal is best for a specific paper, for example, speed and acceptance metrics in relation to the author’s context, but more importantly the aim and scope of the journal and its coverage of a particular subject domain. As an editorial team, we are sometimes bemused by the variation of subject content in submissions. We have a 25% acceptance rate and regularly in editorials we try to encourage papers on topical and innovative studies relating to online interactive learning or learning with digital and interactive tools. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been increased interest in remote learning and how much or how little interactivity this can engender. But of course current trends in interactive learning tend to focus on artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality and gamification, linking these factors to learning motivation, engagement and achievement. That does not mean that we would only welcome papers in these topical and trending areas: it is important to facilitate debate in the educational research community about the impact of increasingly ubiquitous technologies, and we have definitely moved on from explaining learning management systems and flipped learning as innovative topics for study. But there is often a new context, be it geographical or practical, in which well-known interactive technologies or strategies can offer useful insights provided the research methodology is sound. What surprises us is that in any 20 or so submissions there is likely to be at least one which doesn’t relate to the specific journal scope, wasting everyone’s time, not least the author’s. We ask ourselves whether the authors have actually looked at the journal’s scope (on the website) and read some of the journal’s articles in their field. We often have to encourage authors to submit to other journals which do relate to their own subject content and do not relate to interactive learning environments. In addition, we sometimes have to reject interesting papers which are sound academically but cover already very well-published ideas. The fundamental questions here are: why and for whom are you writing? If we consider what prompted the idea, we understand that a well-received conference paper is often the basis for a journal submission. But while the conference delegates and reviewers may have found a study unusual and exciting, particularly as this could be something delegates might relate directly to their own practice, when it comes to journal submission it really is worth plunging into the journal and reviewing what has been published there. This will help guide authors to the style, preferred methodologies and trending arguments which readers find useful.

It seeks to uncover researchers' perspectives, behaviours, and the impact of data management on their work, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective data sharing practices that align with the evolving needs of the research community. 
Now in its eighth year, the 2023 survey findings, presented in this poster, shed light on the evolving landscape of research data sharing and emphasise the critical need for adaptable, nuanced approaches. 
This poster will give a preview of the 2023 results, pulling out some of the main findings and analysis of year-on-year trends, with key regional differences highlighted. 
One main theme to emerge is that a one size fits all approach for research data management does not work, rather there should be a move to a more nuanced strategy. Researchers across different disciplines and regions have unique needs, and their approaches to research data management vary significantly. This underscores the necessity of moving towards a more adaptable and nuanced data management strategies tailored to specific research contexts.

Published by BMJ. Introduction Scientific progress, including in evidencebased medicine, requires all available evidence to be accessed, scrutinised, interpreted and used. Missing or incomplete evidence creates biases and errors in later research. Open science practices are movements and procedures that aim to increase transparency in science production. They aim to make scientific knowledge available, accessible and reusable, benefitting scientific collaboration and all society. Open access is a core component of open science that aims to help solve the problem of accessibility. Traditional publication behind a paywall can hide evidence from the public, clinicians, policymakers and other researchers. Whether online or print, traditional scientific journals maintain their content behind a paywall, with only abstracts freely available to read. Readers access articles by purchasing the individual article, the entire journal issue or through a subscription. These journal subscriptions are purchased by institutions like universities and libraries. However, readers whose institutions cannot afford these subscriptions or who are not affiliated to an institution are often unable to pay to access every article they need. Members of the public and readers in lowresourced countries are disproportionately affected. Open access is defined as making a document freely available for anyone to read and, depending on the licence model, share and use (Box 1). Scholarly publishers now offer open access routes for publishing journal articles such as protocols, commentaries, reviews and result articles. The academic community expects these publishers to adhere to the same quality standards as in traditional closed access publication, such as peer review, indexing and permanent archiving. Biomedical research has progressively adopted open access, with yearly increases in the percentage of articles available as open access publications and the number of countries and policies mandating open access. 6 Online supplemental text 1 summarises national and international open access mandates. Open access has the potential to solve the problem of accessibility. It benefits the final users of the evidence produced, who are patients and healthcare professionals in the case of evidencebased medicine. It also benefits researchers, who can avoid waste from reproducing investigations unnecessarily or having to reinvent procedures that are not clearly explained. To help authors to decide whether to choose open access and how, we summarise the main benefits of open access, the routes for open access and their challenges.",BMJ evidence-based medicine,2023.0,11,"{'url': 'https://ebm.bmj.com/content/ebmed/early/2023/09/28/bmjebm-2022-112126.full.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11287529, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

About 303,000 mothers die globally, and one in every 180 is at risk from maternal causes. Developing regions account for 99% of maternal deaths. Maternal near miss (MNM) resulted in long-term consequences. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the prevalence and predictors of maternal near miss in Ethiopia from January 2015 to March 2023. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis cover both published and unpublished studies from different databases (PubMed, CINHAL, Scopus, Science Direct, and the Cochrane Library) to search for published studies whilst searches for unpublished studies were conducted using Google Scholar and Google searches. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Duplicated studies were removed using Endnote X8. The paper quality was also assessed based on the JBI checklist. Finally, 21 studies were included in the study. Data synthesis and statistical analysis were conducted using STATA Version 17 software. Forest plots were used to present the pooled prevalence using the random effect model. Heterogeneity and publication bias was evaluated using Cochran’s Q test, (Q) and I squared test (I^2). Subgroup analysis based on study region and year of publication was performed. Result From a total of 705 obtained studies, twenty-one studies involving 701,997 pregnant or postpartum mothers were included in the final analysis. The national pooled prevalence of MNM in Ethiopia was 140/1000 [95% CI: 80, 190]. Lack of formal education [AOR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.09, 3.10], Lack of antenatal care [AOR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.33, 3.03], history of cesarean section [AOR = 4.07, 95% CI: 2.91, 5.24], anemia [AOR = 4.86, 95% CI: 3.24, 6.47], and having chronic medical disorder [AOR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.53, 3.29] were among the predictors of maternal near misses from the pooled estimate. Conclusion The national prevalence of maternal near miss was still substantial. Antenatal care is found to be protective against maternal near miss. Emphasizing antenatal care to prevent anemia and modifying other chronic medical conditions is recommended as prevention strategies. Avoiding primary cesarean section is recommended unless a clear indication is present. Finally, the country should place more emphasis on strategies for reducing MNM and its consequences, with the hope of improving women's health.",BMC Women's Health,2023.0,5,"{'url': 'https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12905-023-02523-9', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10357694, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

dd446abecfb7c0e5cb384d4054b15fef2c3a02ed,Tooth intentional replantation from 1964 to 2023: A bibliometric analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIM
There is no thorough overview of intentional tooth replantation techniques. We performed a bibliometric analysis of the development of intentional tooth replantation.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A comprehensive search of the Web of Science and SCOPUS databases was conducted in February 2023. Original articles and reviews of human studies with ""intentional replantation"" or synonyms in the titles, abstracts, or keywords were included. A descriptive analysis of bibliographic data, co-occurrence analysis, and coupling of publications was performed. Multivariate analysis was used to explore the bibliometric parameters associated with the citation counts.


RESULTS
The study included 171 papers, which were co-authored by 500 individuals affiliated with 217 institutions from 28 countries/regions. The USA contributed the greatest number of publications, followed by China, and Japan. The USA had 694 citations, followed by Japan (210), and Turkey (210). The Journal of Endodontics and Dental Traumatology contributed the most citations. Five directions for future research were identified based on the coupling relationships of publications, including ""managing vertical root fractures with adhesive resin using the intentional replantation technique,"" ""intentional replantation for periodontally hopeless or endodontically compromised teeth,"" ""intentional replantation for treating abnormalities of morphological development,"" ""outcomes and prognosis factors of intentional replantation,"" and ""treating root replacement resorption by intentional replantation."" Multivariate analysis showed that the publication year, Journal Citation Reports ranking of journals, study design, and disease type were predictors of citation counts.


CONCLUSIONS
This bibliometric analysis provides a comprehensive description of the intentional replantation technique. The USA published the greatest volume of papers and generated the most citations. The Journal of Endodontics and Dental Traumatology are considered the most influential. The Journal Citation Reports journal ranking (Q1, Q2), study design (case reports, cohort studies), and disease type (crown root fractures) were associated with the citation counts.",Dental Traumatology,2023.0,4,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/edt.12884?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/edt.12884, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study was conducted to compare the undergraduate nursing program in Iran and the nursing school of the University of Maryland, USA. 
Methods: The present study is a descriptive-comparative study that was conducted in the 2023 year by searching the Persian and English keywords: Curriculum, Nursing, Nursing Education, and Educational Plan in databases. We used curriculums which were downloaded from the website of the Iranian Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education and the website of the University of Maryland, USA. To compare the approach of George F. Brady was carried out in four stages: Description, Interpretation, Juxtaposition, and Comparison. 
Results: The bachelor of nursing program in Iran and the university of Maryland in the United States deferred in the way of admission to the field, perspective, research-based approach, and variety of values. Also, they were similar in terms of the lack of specialized interview in entering the field, early presence in the clinical environment, diversity in teaching strategies, and the use of various basic science courses.

66ffd946aa0dca4d299cc8cfed032829e8828aca,The Awareness of Sudden Infant Death Among Saudi Arabian Women in 2023,"Background Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) refers to the unexpected and unexplained death of a child under one year old. The pathogenesis of SIDS remains unclear. However, certain factors such as the child’s sleeping position, sleeping on a soft mattress, and maternal smoking have been suggested to contribute to its occurrence. The objective of this study was to evaluate the level of awareness of SIDS among Saudi Arabian women in 2023. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 mothers in Saudi Arabia, over a period of three months, from June to August 2023, using an online questionnaire to gather socio-demographic information from mothers of infants younger than one year old in Saudi Arabia, the sleeping practices of their infants, and their knowledge about SIDS risk factors. Data were coded using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY), and statistical significance tests were employed for data analysis. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results Among the 277 participating mothers, 44% were 31-40 years old, 93% were Saudi, 60% were employed, 65% were nonsmokers, and 64% placed babies in a supine position for sleep. About 37% of mothers used a duvet for bedding during summer, compared to 66% who used a duvet during winter, and 81% utilized a soft mattress cover in their children’s beds. Additionally, 67% of mothers reported that their children used a pacifier while sleeping. More than half (54%) of mothers were aware of SIDS with media as their primary source of information. Among those under 21 years old, 50% demonstrated a high level of awareness, compared to 36% of those aged over 50. Conclusion Most women in this study were found to be unaware of SIDS. Among those who were aware, the media was the primary source of information. Higher educational attainment was associated with better understanding.",Cureus,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/196221/20231208-16291-15d8jlc.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10771711, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

39b9e546c0cde2a2279d389f98977466f9aa0ee3,Welcoming More Participation in Open Data Science for the Oceans.,"Open science is a global movement happening across all research fields. Enabled by technology and the open web, it builds on years of efforts by individuals, grassroots organizations, institutions, and agencies. The goal is to share knowledge and broaden participation in science, from early ideation to making research outputs openly accessible to all (open access). With an emphasis on transparency and collaboration, the open science movement dovetails with efforts to increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science and society. The US Biden-Harris Administration and many other US government agencies have declared 2023 the Year of Open Science, providing a great opportunity to boost participation in open science for the oceans. For researchers day-to-day, open science is a critical piece of modern analytical workflows with increasing amounts of data. Therefore, we focus this article on open data science-the tooling and people enabling reproducible, transparent, inclusive practices for data-intensive research-and its intersection with the marine sciences. We discuss the state of various dimensions of open science and argue that technical advancements have outpaced our field's culture change to incorporate them. Increasing inclusivity and technical skill building are interlinked and must be prioritized within the marine science community to find collaborative solutions for responding to climate change and other threats to marine biodiversity and society.

This was done during the First Quarter of School Year 2022-2023 to the 81 Grade 10 students of Sarrat National High School. 35-item researchers-made test (pretest and posttest) and a motivation checklist were used to gather data. Teaching using traditional lecture-discussion methods was done in both groups but with the addition of QQTIHPRS in the experimental group. Students’ pretest and posttest scores were analyzed using frequency distribution and percentage. The t-test was used to find out if there exists significant difference between the students’ mean scores in the pretest, posttest, and pretest and posttest in both experimental and control groups. The mean was used to analyze data from the students’ motivation checklist. Results showed that both groups have gained significantly higher scores in the posttest than in the pretest. However, the posttest mean score of the experimental group is significantly higher than that of the control group. This implies that the students in the experimental group performed better than those in the control group. It was also found that when QQTIHPRS were utilized in teaching Earth Science, students were actively involved; excited and thrilled; motivated to work, shared their ideas, and established camaraderie and teamwork.

About 22% of obstructed labor is complicated by obstetric fistula. Skilled birth attendants during delivery are essential for the prevention of obstetric fistula. However, little is known about the status of the knowledge and practice of obstetric fistula prevention in the Gamo zone. Objective We aimed to assess the knowledge, practice, and associated factors of obstetric caregivers on the prevention of obstetric fistula in public health facilities of the Gamo zone in southwest Ethiopia 2023. Method A cross-sectional study was employed among 372 obstetric caregivers in selected public health facilities of the Gamo zone in southwest Ethiopia from 1 December 2022 to 30 January 2023. Study participants were selected by a simple random sampling technique, and data were collected by using a pre-tested and self-administered questionnaire. The collected data were coded and entered into Epi-Data version 4.6 computer software and exported to SPSS version 27 for analysis purposes. Bivariable and Multivariable Logistic analyses were applied. The level of significance was declared at a P-value ≤0.05 and a 95% confidence interval. Results About 57% [95% CI (53.00–62.00)] of participants had good knowledge, and about 55.4% [95% CI (50.00–60.00)] of obstetric caregivers showed good practice for obstetric fistula prevention. The factors significantly associated with knowledge were service year [AOR = 2.50, 95% CI = (1.12–6.73)], types of a health facility [AOR = 1.99, 95% CI = (1.01–3.92)], age [AOR = 2.38, 95% CI = (1.03–5.49)], and in-service training [AOR = 4.61, 95% CI = (2.35–9.05)]. In-service training [AOR = 14.86, 95% CI = (12.75–18.73)], service year [AOR = 3.58, 95% CI = (1.24–10.29)], and knowledge [AOR: 13.24, 95% CI = (6.18–14.34)] were factors which were significantly associated with the practice of obstetric caregivers towards obstetric fistula prevention. Conclusion The knowledge and practice of obstetric caregivers on the prevention of obstetric fistula was low in public health facilities of the Gamo zone. In this study, practicing at a hospital was a factor significantly associated with the knowledge of obstetric caregivers.

4035ab73f8197586d151f585046d1852b2cb227f,Science with the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST),"The Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is a dedicated photometric surveying facility being built jointly by University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO). It is equipped with a 2.5-meter diameter primary mirror, an active optics system, and a mosaic CCD camera with 0.73 gigapixels on the primary focal plane for high-quality image capture over a 6.5-square-degree field of view. The installation of WFST near the summit of Saishiteng mountain in the Lenghu region is scheduled in summer of 2023, and the operation is planned to start three months later. WFST will scan the northern sky in four optical bands ( u, g, r and i ) at cadences from hourly/daily in the deep high-cadence survey (DHS) program, to semi-weekly in the wide field survey (WFS) program. During a photometric night, a nominal 30 s exposure in the WFS program will reach a depth of 22.27, 23.32, 22.84, and 22.31 (AB magnitudes) in these four bands, respectively, allowing for the detection of a tremendous amount of transients in the low- z universe and a systematic investigation of the variability of Galactic and extragalactic objects. In the DHS program, intranight 90 s exposures as deep as 23 ( u ) and 24 mag ( g ), in combination with target of opportunity follow-ups, will provide a unique opportunity to explore energetic transients in demand for high sensitivities, including the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave events, supernovae within a few hours of their explosions, tidal disruption events and fast, luminous optical transients even beyond redshift of unity. In addition, the final 6-year co-added images, anticipated to reach g ≃ 25.8 mag in WFS or 1.5 mags deeper in DHS, will be of fundamental importance to general Galactic and extragalactic science. The highly uniform legacy surveys of WFST will serve as an indispensable complement to those of the Vera C.

f4898412b6cda01a9519f7ee2291a6c675bd5799,Interdisciplinary Review of Demonic Possession Between 1980 and 2023: A Compendium of Scientific Cases,"Episodes of demonic or spirit possession, where individuals perceive their bodies and minds as being controlled by supernatural entities, have been the subject of extensive research across various disciplines. Despite this, the extent to which existing scientific explanations can account for these phenomena is still uncertain, especially in terms of the aspects that remain unexplained. This official review aims to clarify the current scientific understanding of the origins, mechanisms, and causes of these seemingly extraordinary experiences. Our analysis includes 52 documented cases of possession, reviewed from literature published between 1890 and 2023 and incorporating insights from psychology, medicine, anthropology, and theology. We examine common symptom patterns, delve into the research conducted, and evaluate how many cases are still unexplained within the existing behavioral science framework. Quantitative models indicate a 0.01923 probability of a possession case being scientifically unexplained. The likelihood of discovering new, truly unexplained cases of demonic possession in the future is estimated at 0.0031, with a 0.0023 probability of encountering five such cases in a single year. Moreover, we assess the medical and psychological interventions employed in these cases and propose practical guidelines for the safe use of exorcisms and specific pharmacological treatments. This study advocates for the integration of therapeutic interventions, combined with the expertise of anthropologists for culturally sensitive actions and Catholic Church priests for spiritual guidance, including exorcisms where appropriate as determined by ecclesiastical authorities. Our conclusion suggests that integrative approaches provide the most comprehensive clinical support in such cases and underscore how possession episodes challenge our scientific understanding of consciousness and its boundaries.",Journal of Scientific Exploration,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://journalofscientificexploration.org/index.php/jse/article/download/3235/2009', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31275/20233235?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31275/20233235, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

05d8444d04257f204b45853bfef3fd8a70f68682,"Journal of Biogeography Innovation Awards, 2023","The Journal of Biogeography (JBI) is committed to developing new opportunities that complement and extend biogeography's reach and impact, in addition to publishing the broadest and best existing biogeographic research. Thus, we are delighted to introduce a new Virtual Issue that does all these things, collating papers submitted in response to the announcement of the JBI Innovation Awards, a venue for manuscripts firstauthored by early career researchers that encourages new ideas and perspectives in the discipline. The virtual issue begins with the inaugural (Carvalho et al., 2023; Vasconcelos et al., 2023; Windsor et al., 2023) and most recent (Korábek et al., 2022; Schrader et al., 2023) papers and will continue to grow each year. The manuscripts were considered using JBI's standard editorial and peer review processes and were additionally ranked in terms of the originality of their ideas, identification of a gap in knowledge, and impact of findings. The collection illustrates the creativity and vigour of biogeographical research. We congratulate Ondřej Korábek and Julian Schrader as the recipients of the most recent JBI Innovation Awards and their coauthors for sharing in this success. Korábek and colleagues' paper, ‘In both directions: Expansions of European land snails to the north and south from glacial refugia’, presents a fascinating picture of dispersal by classically slowmoving creatures across Central Europe since the Last Glacial Maximum. Using genetic data and radiocarbon dating of fossils, they reconstruct a complex tale of postglacial movements, finding that some species have moved more than others, recolonization has happened more or less in all directions, and some snails made surprisingly rapid leaps (likely associated with translocation by humans or other animals). Their detailed data add substance to postglacial biogeographic theory (Pielou, 1991) while also highlighting hidden assumptions— as might be implicit in, for example, the idiom ‘a snail's pace’— and so cautioning against underestimating the limits of reconstructing movements in other taxa and across other spatial and temporal scales for which data are less plentiful. Putting a timescale on dispersal events further emphasizes the relevance of their work to understanding the dynamics of movements of slowmoving taxa such as snails in other parts of the world, with richer endemic faunas and critical conservation implications (Perera et al., 2021). Such studies can fill gaps in our understanding of dispersal in general, building bridges between theoretical biogeography and invasion science which is of critical importance in the face of climate change. Schrader and colleagues likewise advance longstanding theory in their paper ‘ETIBT: An Equilibrium Theory of Island Biogeography for plant traits’. They build on the foundational Equilibrium Theory of Island Biogeography (ETIB; MacArthur & Wilson, 1963, 1967), which inspired countless island studies. However, the core theory and subsequent papers have focussed largely on species richness, downplaying other aspects of diversity. Schrader et al. (2023) extend the ETIB's core principles to assess the processes affecting plant functional traits over time. Using plant distribution and trait data from islands of varying size in Western Australia, the authors tested whether individual traits, and functional diversity as a whole (FD), remained at equilibrium through time, similar to the equilibrium species richness predicted by the ETIB. They found that while there was turnover in species on the islands, locally extinct species tended to be replaced by new species possessing similar traits. As such, Schrader and colleagues indicate that several core concepts of the ETIB can be extended to functional traits and FD, opening up many novel areas for future island research, including the applicability of the extended theory to other taxa. The consequential science in both papers is accentuated by easytoread text and attractive informative figures that engage the reader and emphasize the logical flow of the narrative. Both papers also bring multiple perspectives (data types, places, species, and traits), thus illustrating how ‘comparative biogeography’— an approach that is key for JBI articles— can improve the power of inferring effects and our confidence in inferences. Coincidentally, these papers also presage two upcoming special issues of the journal, one on the Biogeography of the Carpathians and the other on Functional Island Biogeography. This suggests these are indeed two areas of growing interest. The Carpathian Mountains are an emerging model region where overlaying diverse biogeographic studies is yielding an integrated understanding of how intersections among processes and scales can shape biogeographic patterns. Likewise, functional biogeography is finally coming of age as it shifts from generic descriptions of FD to consideration of the effects of specific traits; and nowhere is there a richer theatre than in an update of the quintessentially neutral Equilibrium Theory of Biogeography, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this year (MacArthur & Wilson, 1963). By bringing these two burgeoning areas of research to the fore— and highlighting areas of overlap and synergy— the awards papers and forthcoming special issues will advance biogeographic concepts and theory globally.",Journal of Biogeography,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jbi.14630', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/jbi.14630?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14630, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

830d5923fc5dfafbb3c2afbf73454a411b58888a,Differentiated Instruction for an Enhanced Students’Academic Performance in Science 10 (PHYSICS),"The study aimed to determine the effectiveness of Differentiated Instruction strategy using selected Multiple Intelligences activities on the students’ performance in Science 10 (Physics). The researcher employed quasi-experimental research and a descriptive method utilizing questionnaires as the principal tool to gather the data. The respondents involved in the study were the One Hundred Twenty (120) Grade 10 Junior High School students of Bagong Nayon II National High School, Antipolo City, during the school year 2022-2023. They were grouped according to their dominant Multiple Intelligence. The study revealed that among the first five dominant multiple intelligences of the students, the majority of the students are more on intrapersonal intelligence rather than the other. This implies that some of the respondents perform more in intrapersonal tasks and skills which would then indicate that teachers should assess each learner's multiple intelligence to know and enhance students' performance in academics. The use of Differentiated Instruction in teaching Science 10 (Physics) greatly improved the performance of the students in terms of their academics. This was shown on the pretest and posttest performance of the students in which their posttest performance increased greatly after the utilization of  differentiated instruction in teaching Science 10. It can also be noted that the Intrapersonal Group of students got the highest increase in mean score. The average mean score in the pretest is 19.49 and 35.69 in the posttest with the mean increase of 16.20. This implies that although the students were given different activities, they all performed well. Based on the findings of the study, teachers can use differentiated instruction for the purpose of enhancing the academic performance of the students. This also implies that the prepared activities intended for these groups of students were effective. Therefore, a student-focused approach of teaching fosters an effective learning environment and excellent academic performance.",International Journal of Multidisciplinary Applied Business and Education Research,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://ijmaberjournal.org/index.php/ijmaber/article/download/1163/696', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.11594/ijmaber.04.08.21?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.11594/ijmaber.04.08.21, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

24c6da4621469ccc94f179aa3626e0428217ca73,"Dieter Stoeffler (1939–2023): Outstanding scientist, mentor, and friend","Dieter St€ offler was born on 23 May 1939 in Schramberg, County Rottweil, in the Black Forest region of southern Germany. He passed away after a considerable time of slowly decaying health in the evening of Wednesday, 5 April 2023, in the presence of his loved ones—his sons Bernd and Dirk St€ offler, and his dear partner Heide Schmidt-Schuberth. He is also survived by a granddaughter, Luca. Dieter was 83 years old. Dieter served his science over more than 5 decades with exceptional dedication and success. We are commemorating him for his prowess in science—to be more exact, in geology, mineralogy, and planetary science, as well as for having been our mentor and, later, colleague and dear friend. Dieter was truly exceptional in his dedication, his clarity in discussion and debate, his clear vision of issues to be dealt with, his analytical mind when it came to judging people and students, and his love for his family and professional community. We are missing him, as will many others in the scientific community. Dieter spent his childhood years in the forests and mountains around his hometown, where he already during those early years learnt about the fascinating geology of the Black Forest region and developed a keen interest in natural science. No wonder then, that he took up studies of geology, and soon thereafter, of mineralogy at the Eberhard Karls University in T€ ubingen in 1958. He graduated with a PhD in 1963—at the age of just 24. The PhD topic may surprise considering his later specialization—it was a thesis about the Saarland coal deposits. Until 1970, he served as an assistant docent (Wissenschaftlicher Assistant) in the research group of Professor Wolf von Engelhardt. That year he also received his Habilitation degree, which has been a prerequisite for application for professorial positions in Germany. Until 1974, he taught and carried out research as a Privatdozent at the University of T€ ubingen. In 1974, he was elected as a Professor of Petrography and Geology of Ore Deposits within the Institute of Mineralogy at the Westf€alische Wilhelms-Universit€at M€ unster. He held this position until 1987, by when he had achieved the creation of a new institute at M€ unster, the Institute of Planetology. He was appointed as the founding director of the new institute to the chair of Cosmic Mineralogy. In 1993, after reunification of East and West Germany, which was followed by enormous investments into all sectors of Eastern Germany, Dieter St€ offler took up a huge new challenge. He was appointed as the Director of the Museum f€ ur Naturkunde Berlin, which had been recognized as a world-class museum prior to World War II but then had gone into decline and even had substantial war damage. In 1993, the Museum was a so-called Central Institute of Humboldt Universit€at zu Berlin, where Dieter also held the chair for Mineralogy and Petrography. Dieter remained as Director of the Museum until 1999 and took his obligatory retirement from his professorship in 2004. He remained very active within the Mineralogy and Impact Cratering research group at the Museum until 2018, when he finally paid his farewell to active scientific work. Dieter St€ offler, throughout an exceptionally long and successful career, enjoyed the interaction with colleagues in Europe and abroad, and with his many postgraduate students, to the full. He supervised/co-supervised not less than some 60 Diploma/MSc and PhD candidates, and successfully supported many of them in establishing their career paths. Quite a few of his pupils have themselves had great academic or industrial careers, not in the least having benefitted from Dieter’s mentorship.

In today's fast-paced world, technology plays a crucial role in education. With the rise of the internet, technology-driven education has become the norm. However, it is essential to understand this impact on students, especially in the field of Hospitality Management. Hence, this study aimed to bridge the gap between technology-driven education and practical learning experiences. Quantitative description research was used in this study, which involved collecting data through a survey questionnaire. The study's respondents were 128 second, third, and fourth-year Hospitality Management students who were enrolled in the first semester of the academic year 2022-2023 at Gabaldon Campus, NEUST. A total sample technique was used to select the respondents. The results showed that most students preferred traditional face-to-face learning over distance learning. They felt that they could retain the information better when taught in a traditional classroom setting. The students also said they preferred the interaction and hands-on experience they got from traditional face-to-face learning. However, the study also found that students appreciated the flexibility distance learning offered. They felt that they could study at their own pace and had the option to pause the lecture whenever needed. This made the learning process less stressful for them. Based on the results, the researchers recommend that future studies may use this study as a basis for further research in the field. They also suggested that teachers may integrate brainstorming activities to improve the skills of their students. Additionally, they recommended that teachers integrate mobile phones into the classroom to enhance teaching flexibility. In conclusion, this study aimed to gather the perceptions of Hospitality Management students who have experienced both distance learning and traditional face-to-face learning.

Over the past decade, scientific periodicals have extensively discussed ways to improve the effectiveness of postgraduate studies, given the decline in researcher numbers and dissertation defense rates, stricter requirements for dissertation councils, and their evolving operational forms. This article attempts to explore the role of mentorship in science within the context of the scientific and technological development objectives set by the country's leadership. The study highlights trends in scientific mentorship development and defines its functions based on survey data from research advisors working in Russian universities and research organizations. The study identifies contradictions that need to be addressed and proposes ways to improve the work and status of research advisors. Methods. The empirical foundation of this study is based on a sociological survey of postgraduate students and applicants' research advisors with a candidate or doctoral degree — academic, scientific, and administrative and managerial personnel of universities and research organizations (N = 3000). The survey included representatives from all broad scientific fields (natural, technical, humanities, social, medical, agricultural). The survey was conducted in 2023. Results and Discussion. The study results reveal that the main challenges research advisors face when working with applicants for academic degrees are organizational and competence-related, tied to the high level of bureaucratization in scientific personnel training, lack of flexibility, insufficient time allocation, and poor competencies of the participants in this process, especially those responsible for scientific and technological development. The study notes an increase in the complexity of the functional roles of research advisors due to an outdated workload distribution system that hinders full participation in scientific personnel training to meet current demands. Research advisors believe they require specialized training and describe the current state of scientific personnel training as being in crisis, necessitating significant changes. The study identifies several directions for modernizing higher qualification personnel training to address scientific and technological development challenges: aligning postgraduate training with practical experience (transitioning to professional and industrial postgraduate education in experimental mode for certain fields); creating individualized tracks for dissertation preparation (implementing individual programs); conducting internships at enterprises oriented at knowledge-driven economy and academic mobility improvement; appointing consultants from companies alongside research advisors, etc. The study results are discussed in terms of gender, age, job differences, and affiliation to a specific field of science. Conclusion. The study suggests that adopting a hybrid model of scientific mentorship, which combines elements of the traditional model (the research advisor being the sole mentor) and other models (developmental mentorship, multiple mentors, supportive mentorship) prevalent in international practice, could help address certain organizational and competence-related issues. To enhance the benefits of postgraduate studies for the hightech sector, special attention should be paid to natural and technical sciences, interdisciplinary research, dissertations commissioned by the industry, organizations, or companies, joint supervision models, and strengthening ties between universities, research organizations, and the economy sector itself among others.",Science Governance and Scientometrics,2023.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33873/2686-6706.2023.18-4.544-577?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33873/2686-6706.2023.18-4.544-577, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The type of research used is pre-experimental design research through one group pretest-postest design. The subjects in this study were 22 students of class VII A in junior high school SMP Negeri 3 Sumberejo, Bojonegoro, in the 2022/2023 academic year. The data collection techniques used were tests and questionnaires. Research instruments are science literacy tests and student response questionnaire sheets. The results were analyzed using the N-Gain and t-paired tests with effect size. The implementation observation sheet and the response questionnaire were analyzed descriptively and quantitatively. The results showed that the science literacy ability of grade VII A students of SMP Negeri 3 Sumberejo increased from an average pretest score of 30.6 to 38,03 at the post-test. Students' science literacy ability is in a low category with an average N-Gain of 0.10 with an effect size of 0.63 in the moderate category. Improving students' science literacy skills is also supported by implementing learning that is carried out correctly. The application of project-based learning received a positive response from students. Students find learning using project-based learning environmental pollution material fun, attractive, and easy to understand and use, helping to understand the concept of environmental pollution and practicing science literacy.

How do, and how should, the social sciences, and particularly sociology, react to these pathologies of late modernity? I would argue that the bulk of the responses of the social sciences and/or sociology to these pathologies are defined as being classically liberal but politically illiberal – I call this peculiar combination ‘Symbolic Liberalism’.

This year, she was awarded the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for significant scientific achievements in explaining essential causes of gender differences in the labor market. For the first time, the laureate has provided comprehensive evidence of changes in women’s wages and their participation in the US labor market over two centuries, which had previously been largely unknown. Using historical and economic analysis, C. Goldin showed that despite technological development, economic growth and an increase in the share of employed women in the 20th century, the income gap between women and men almost did not disappear over a long period. However, women’s educational attainment has steadily increased, and in most high-income countries, it is now significantly higher compared with men. In her research, she demonstrated that, in addition to education, women’s access to contraceptives played a crucial role in accelerating revolutionary changes that provided new opportunities for career, marriage, and family planning. C. Goldin explained that most of the gender gap in income before the 1980s was caused by differences in education and career choices between women and men. Exceptionally, the situation changed when women got married and did not return to the labor market. Therefore, in her research on gender pay inequality, C. Goldin focused on analyzing the behavior of married women and changes in their incomes during marriage. Thus, the researcher proved that income inequality in married couples (woman and man) still exists, even if they both have high-paying jobs or are engaged in the same profession. This difference in income occurs mainly with the birth of the first child.",Ìstorìâ narodnogo gospodarstva ta ekonomìčnoï dumki Ukraïni,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.15407/ingedu2023.56.150', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15407/ingedu2023.56.150?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15407/ingedu2023.56.150, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d5bdc075fc0babbce7897af2caacaedce7523700,A Century of Evolution in Spine Surgery Publications: A Bibliometric Analysis of the Field From 1900 to 2023,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Spine surgery has advanced in concert with our deeper understanding of its elements. Narrowly focused bibliometric analyses have been conducted previously, but never on the entire corpus of the field. Using big data and bibliometrics, we appraised the entire corpus of spine surgery publications to study the evolution of the specialty as a scholarly field since 1900. METHODS: We queried Web of Science for all contents from 13 major publications dedicated to spine surgery. We next queried by topic [topic = (spine OR spinal OR vertebrae OR vertebral OR intervertebral OR disc OR disk)]; these results were filtered to include articles published by 49 other publications that were manually determined to contain pertinent articles. Articles, along with their metadata, were exported. Statistical and bibliometric analyses were performed using the Bibliometrix R package and various Python packages. RESULTS: Eighty-five thousand five hundred articles from 62 journals and 134 707 unique authors were identified. The annual growth rate of publications was 2.78%, with a surge after 1980, concurrent with the growth of specialized journals. International coauthorship, absent before 1970, increased exponentially with the formation of influential spine study groups. Reference publication year spectroscopy allowed us to identify 200 articles that comprise the historical roots of modern spine surgery and each of its subdisciplines. We mapped the emergence of new topics and saw a recent lexical evolution toward outcomes- and patient-centric terms. Female and minority coauthorship has increased since 1990, but remains low, and disparities across major publications persist. CONCLUSION: The field of spine surgery was borne from pioneering individuals who published their findings in a variety of journals. The renaissance of spine surgery has been powered by international collaboration and is increasingly outcomes focused. While spine surgery is gradually becoming more diverse, there is a clear need for further promotion and outreach to under-represented populations.",Neurosurgery,2023.0,6,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1227/neu.0000000000002648?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000002648, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f427eeb9ca40bddd57873ac3af1f156c0dc60071,A Data Science Maturity Model Applied to Students' Modeling,"Maturity models define a series of levels, each representing an increased complexity in information systems. Data Science appears in the Business Intelligence (BI) and Business Analytics (BA) literature. This work applies the _IABE maturity model, which includes two additional levels: Data Engineering (DE) at the bottom and Business Experimentation (BE) at the top. This study uses the _IABE model for students' modeling in the ModEst project. For this purpose, the Public Administration organism is the Directorate-General for Statistics of Education and Science (DGEEC) of the Portuguese Education Ministry. DGEEC provided vast data on two million students per year in the Portuguese school system, from pre-scholar to doctoral programs. This work presents the comprehensible _IABE maturity model to extract new knowledge from the DGEEC dataset. The method applied is _IABE, where after the DE level, wh-questions are formulated and answered with the most appropriate techniques at each maturity level. This work's novelty is applying the maturity model _IABE to a unique dataset for the first time. Wh-questions are stated at the BI level using data summarization; at the BA level, predictive models are performed, and counterfactual approaches are presented at the BE level. Doi: 10.28991/ESJ-2023-07-06-07 Full Text: PDF",Emerging Science Journal,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.ijournalse.org/index.php/ESJ/article/download/1968/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.28991/esj-2023-07-06-08?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.28991/esj-2023-07-06-08, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In general, students do not know how to start and what to talk about. In addition, speaking is a time-consuming process, starting from choosing a subject or topic of conversation, analyzing and classifying the science behind it, choosing the right words to express their ideas, and pouring them into a series of words. Students are also less motivated to practice speaking English.  This fact resulted in students' speaking scores still below KKM (Minimum Completeness Criteria).  To reduce the obstacles above, a way is needed by applying learning videos in learning English speaking skills. This research was conducted to improve English speaking skills by applying learning videos to grade IX students of SMPN 171 Jakarta, which in the end is expected to increase student achievement. This research was conducted in three cycles in three stages, namely pre-production, production process and post-production. The pre-production stage begins with curriculum review by identifying basic competencies that will be used as learning material, making the necessary instruments, looking for related references, preparing the equipment needed, selecting and training students as models. At the stage of the production process, namely carrying out the creation of learning videos sequentially according to the learning video scenario that has been made before. In the post-product stage, the learning video is ready for publication, which includes, video publication in the form of files.  The results of the study can be seen from the increasing confidence of students so that students become active in speaking, the sense of responsibility and cooperation is getting better. These positive attitudes helped improve the speaking ability of grade IX students of SMPN 171 with a significant average increase from 75.9 in cycle one to 78.9 and 81.9 in cycles two and three. Learning completeness also increased from 75.8% in cycle one to 87.9% and 93.9% in cycles two and three.   Thus, it can be concluded that the use of learning videos can improve English speaking skills in grade IX students of SMPN 171 Jakarta for the 2018/2019 academic year.",COMSERVA Indonesian Jurnal of Community Services and Development,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://comserva.publikasiindonesia.id/index.php/comserva/article/download/715/916', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.59141/comserva.v2i12.715?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.59141/comserva.v2i12.715, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Definition, Factors for Enhancing Students Comprehension, and Computational Bibliometric Review Analysis","The purpose of this study is to explain language education development research for improving student comprehension in learning science. This study also reviews the definition of these strategies, identifies factors that contribute to improving students' comprehension, and conducts a computational bibliometric review analysis to determine the efficacy of these approaches using Google Scholar with keywords ""Language"" and ""Learning Science"" from 2019 to 2023. There are also explanations for formal and informal learning, as well as educational levels for researching techniques and developing curriculum. The use of technology in media and laboratories is also a significant factor in increasing students' literacy and language impact. Language and student characteristics, motivation, teacher-student relationships, therapy, and psychological conditions are all inextricably linked. We also included information about language barriers for students with special needs, as well as new technologies that improve language learning, in which these can be factors in increasing student’s understanding of learning science. The bibliometric analysis results show that the trend of language research in learning science is decreasing year after year. This is due to the possibility that the focus of educational research has shifted to other areas, such as educational technology, science learning, or educational policy. The co-occurrence analysis results show several keywords that are frequently researched and should be paid attention to, including ""language model,"" ""natural language processing,"" ""deep learning,"" ""student,"" and ""language learning."" These keywords denote important parameters that can improve the learning experience because they enable personalized, interactive, adaptive educational interventions, particularly in language learning contexts, by adapting content and feedback to each student's needs and preferences.

62e2594d2af97347d2370c5a850c9bd8e5eb5b0b,Monitoring invasive macroalgae in southern Portugal: drivers and citizen science contribution,"Under certain environmental and oceanographic conditions, macroalgae can overgrow and accumulate in massive quantities on beaches, causing serious ecological and economic impacts. To address this problem, a citizen science monitoring platform was created to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of macroalgae accumulations along the beaches of Algarve in southern Portugal, with the aim to assess the extent of beach-cast events and their relationship with abiotic factors. A Redundancy Analysis (RDA) and a permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) were carried out to explore the relationship between macroalgae accumulation level and the abiotic variables: sea surface temperature, wind speed, wind direction, currents, maximum sea level, significant wave height, salinity, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, precipitation and radiation. The citizen science campaign showed great participation, resulting in 404 submissions between July 2021 and September 2023. The campaign revealed that three species of macroalgae accumulated on the beaches of Algarve, Ulva sp. (with the presence of Ectocarpales and Dyctiotales) along the sandy eastern coast, and the invasive species Asparagopsis armata and Rugulopteryx okamurae in the rocky central and western beaches, respectively. The accumulations of R. okamurae increased from 2021 to 2023, were registered throughout the year and were more abundant than those of Ulva sp. and A. armata, which were only observed in spring and summer. The highest levels of R. okamurae beach-cast depositions were related to strong wave conditions, and high sea surface temperature and salinity. The accumulation of Ulva sp. was related to high sea surface temperature and salinity whereas A. armata was also correlated with winds parallel to the shore (NW-W). PERMANOVA analysis revealed that sea surface temperature and wave conditions had a significant effect on the overall abundance of macroalgae beach-cast accumulations. Overall, our citizen science campaign effectively involved the public, leading to the collection of important data on monitoring macroalgae accumulations. Through these findings, we were able to pinpoint the environmental, atmospheric, and hydrodynamic factors that contribute to their development, movement, and buildup along the Algarve coastlines.",Frontiers in Environmental Science,2023.0,4,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1324600/pdf?isPublishedV2=False', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1324600?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1324600, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

caf17319d301616e6e77818b526751659e11ec2e,2023 Barringer Medal for Birger Schmitz,"Birger Schmitz has changed the way we think about how collisions in the asteroid belt can affect our planet. Unlike “classical” terrestrial impact research, which mostly studies direct effects of large impacts on Earth, Birger’s main focus is on small to tiny samples in terrestrial sediments deriving from large collisions in the asteroid belt, and inferring their consequences for Earth. He aptly describes his philosophy as “to link the history of the Earth and its life to the astronomical realm”. By establishing his unique Astrogeobiology Laboratory at Lund University, he created the field of paleometeoritics, allowing him to systematically study material that arrived on Earth much earlier than the oldest known meteorite falls recovered from Antarctic ice or old desert surfaces. It is mainly extraterrestrial spinels, dispersed in tiny amounts in sediments or preserved as relics in otherwise highly altered fossil meteorites, that tell this fascinating story. Birger became inspired during his postdoctoral stage in the group of Luis Alvarez at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, while his later scientific life was largely shaped by the unique treasure trove of by now more than 130 fossil meteorites recovered from a quarry in Sweden, followed by the discovery of abundant fossilized micrometeorites in several coeval Ordovician sediment layers around the world. These samples were classified as L chondritic and provided the unequivocal link between a major asteroid collision—the break-up of an L chondrite parent body—and a well-known resetting of the Ar-Ar clock in many L chondrites, precisely dated by the Heidelberg group at 470 million years ago, coinciding with the ages of the sediments in the quarry. To realize the full scientific potential of the fossil meteorites—and to convince the community that they are far more than just a nice but rather exotic research object—required enormous efforts. This included the separation of the rare extraterrestrial chromite grains out of sometimes hundreds of kg sediment, first by dissolving the latter in strong acids, followed by painstaking searches under a binocular microscope. The latter kept Birger busy during many late evening sessions, accompanied by his favorite opera recordings. Equally important, Birger’s charisma and dedication have enabled him to forge a multitude of close collaborations with colleagues and friends around the world, of which the three of us are proud to be a part. While the fossil meteorites provided a clear link to the break-up of the L chondrite parent body, it was the abundant micrometeoritic chromites and chrome-spinels found in coeval sediments in Sweden, Russia, and China that provided the ultimate evidence that this collision in the asteroid belt resulted in a global rain of extraterrestrial matter on Earth, exceeding the current flux by perhaps two orders of magnitude, while still accounting for a significant fraction of present-day meteorite falls. Surprisingly, the cosmic-ray exposure ages of the chromites from the fossil meteorites are very low for meteorite standards, providing direct confirmation of celestial mechanics simulations predicting that the orbits of bodies in the asteroid belt in resonance with the orbits of Jupiter or Saturn can become chaotic and Earthcrossing on a sub-million-year scale. How could the break-up of the L chondrite parent body, and possibly other large extraterrestrial impacts, have affected the climate and life on Earth? This is one of the central questions in Birger Schmitz’s current research agenda. He and his collaborators have shown that the onset of the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE), the most intense ~20 Ma phase of species radiation during the Paleozoic, coincided with the L chondrite parent break-up and also with a known increase in the formation rate of terrestrial impact craters in the mid-to-late Ordovician. This led to the suggestion that the frequent impacts of kilometer-sized asteroids accelerated the biodiversification process. In his latest work, however, Birger and colleagues suggest that the GOBE may have been triggered not by the large impacts themselves, but by the greatly increased amounts of fine dust in the inner solar system and the stratosphere caused by the L chondrite parent break-up and secondary collisions. This dust would have been the cause of the Ordovician Ice Age, which has been well studied for example in Baltoscandia. Schmitz and coworkers show that the break-up coincides with a major eustatic sea-level fall, also previously attributed to the Ordovician Ice Age, and suggest that the sea-level fall, ultimately caused by the high dust concentration in the inner solar system, is the direct trigger for the increase in biodiversity. Birger emphasizes that further scrutiny is required to test this hypothesis, calling, for example, for detailed climate Meteoritics & Planetary Science 58, Nr 8, 1165–1166 (2023) doi: 10.1111/maps.14037",Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/maps.14037', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'unspecified-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/maps.14037?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/maps.14037, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As with previous events, this was an opportunity to gather the growing community of scholars dedicated to improving political science education. Democracy requires functioning institutions and an informed and engaged citizenry. As a community that values undergraduate education and wants to find innovative ways to better educate our students, our goal is to help them become better citizens by stressing the importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and civic engagement. The organization of the day-long conference reflects this spirit. The day was divided into a series of workshops (held in the morning) and panels (during the afternoon). The panels were organized around four tracks: 1) Promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the classroom; 2) Simulations and games; 3) Civic engagement; and 4) Teaching research, writing, and information literary. Summaries of each track’s discussions are provided below. The conference’s theme this year was “Teaching Political Science in a Post-Pandemic Era.” Our experiences in the classrooms during this past year and a half tell us that we are experiencing a new moment in undergraduate education. Students and faculty are facing new challenges related to diminishing resources, overwork, the physical and mental legacies of the pandemic, and the consequences of uneven online learning, among others. How to reconnect with our students—while we rethink and restructure our teaching in the post-pandemic era—is a central question we confront. Responding to our call for proposals, our workshops and panels approached this challenge from diverse and innovative perspectives to improve quantitative reasoning, problem-solving, critical and analytical thinking, communication skills, global/intercultural fluency, leadership and teamwork, and accessibility. All participants and presenters took care in engaging fruitfully and thoughtfully in the discussions throughout the day. The morning workshops discussed a range of issues central to the mission of teaching in a post-pandemic era, and we can only briefly note them here: how to facilitate equity and access in the classroom, the use of DiploSim in International Relations courses, how to create a safe and challenging learning environment, the role of Political Science Honor Societies in engaging students, the foundational principles of antiracist pedagogy, the design of role-playing simulations in remote and hybrid classrooms, how to engage students in local government, and how to teach experimental political science. We were extremely lucky to have Terri Givens, Professor of Political Science at McGill University, and the Founder of Brighter Professional Development, as the keynote speaker during luncheon.

Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is an artificial intelligence technology that generates conversational interactions to user prompts. The trained model can answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. The functionality of ChatGPT in answering chemistry assessment questions requires investigation to ascertain its potential impact on learning and assessment. Two chemistry-focused modules in year 1 and year 2 of a pharmaceutical science program are used to study and evaluate ChatGPT-generated responses in relation to the end-of-year exam assessments. For questions that focused on knowledge and understanding with ""describe” and ""discuss” verbs, the ChatGPT generated responses. For questions that focused on application of knowledge and interpretation with nontext information, the ChatGPT technology reached a limitation. A further analysis of the quality of responses is reported in this study. ChatGPT is not considered a high-risk technology tool in relation to cheating. Similar to the COVID-19 disruption, ChatGPT is expected to provide a catalyst for educational discussions on academic integrity and assessment design. © 2023 The Authors.

The published thematic sections are not based on previously commissioned dossiers. On the contrary, the editor in chief, with feedback from the editorial team, organized freely submitted articles into thematic groups. This thematic organization makes LARR a great tool for learning about the significant and emerging themes in the field of Latin American studies. Salient topics in volume 57 (2022) were the political and decolonizing role of the arts, historical and epistemological reflections on the humanities and the social sciences in Latin America, the role of the middle classes in political changes in Brazil, disability studies, human rights, and political economy. The themes that our authors are working on in 2023 are gender and sexuality studies, Afro-Latin America, racism and xenophobia, environmental studies, the role of the judiciary, rethinking the war in Peru, puzzling socio-economic issues and, of course, public health and epidemics. Please, watch out for exciting debates coming up this year in LARR! Despite the shift to an interdisciplinary emphasis, submissions in the humanities and social science disciplines continue to be strong. I would like to highlight that the discipline of economics is taking off in LARR thanks to the efforts of our new associate editor Rosaluz Durán, affiliated with the University of Lima in Peru. Other disciplines like history, literature, anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies are also receiving high quality contributions. The political science discipline continues to be strong and has shifted its attention to less traditional topics for the field such as gender, sexual orientation, and race. Our film review section is also taking off with great contributions curated by our new associate editor Antonio Gómez of Tulane University. The book review section continues to produce quality reviews and its articles are amongst the most cited in LARR. We are delighted to announce that our impact and cite scores have increased significantly both in general and in the disciplines, as I will explain in more detail below. At the 2023 LASA meeting, LARR is sponsoring several featured panels including a workshop where the public will be able to interact with the editorial team and learn publishing strategies, and a panel celebrating our authors in volume 57 who work on the topics of the LASA meeting, democracy and human rights.

Computational data processing often poses significant challenges for individuals not professionally specialized in this area. In particular, the problem lies in finding suitable computational tools that, on the one hand, have the necessary functionalities and, on the other hand, are easy to use for users with intermediate or low-level competencies. During the academic year 2022/2023, the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Cracow University of Technology conducted classes on data processing for three diverse groups: the third- and fourth-year students of a public high school with a math-physics-computer science profile, undergraduate students in safety engineering, and undergraduate students in applied informatics. The needs regarding the functionalities of the computational tools and the competencies in their usage were compared, both in the assessment of the instructors and the participants themselves.

5b31f1f7ba29043cb7333cfae9f45ff50c6a6961,Is India’s largest fertilizer manufacturer misleading farmers and society using dubious plant and soil science?,"
 
 The accessibility and relatively low cost of nitrogen (N) fertilizers have been a gift to humankind and made it possible to feed the exponentially growing world population. The excessive use of N, in combination with a poor N use efficiency (NUE) in crop production, is associated with severe environmental impacts, and the scientific community has repeatedly warned that the safe operating space for N within the planetary boundaries has been exceeded. In the light of these considerations, a global player and India’s largest fertilizer manufacturer, the Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative (IFFCO), has recently developed and patented a nanotechnology-based fertilizer marketed as Nano Urea (liquid). Strikingly, the producers state that it is now possible to replace a 45 kg bag of conventional urea, containing 21 kg N, by foliar application of just 20 g N in the form of nano urea (NU). If so, N from this novel high-tech fertilizer product should be able to increase the NUE of crops more than 1000 times compared to conventional urea. This year, the Indian government and IFFCO announced plans to massively boost production by building 10 new factories, with an annual production capacity of 440 million bottles NU by 2025 and to expand export of the product to another 25 countries, mainly situated in Asia, Africa and South-America. In the marketing of NU, IFFCO states that there is scientific evidence for distinct beneficial properties in terms of higher crop yields and reduced negative environmental impacts. Similar ambitions have recently been presented for Nano Zinc, Nano Copper, and Nano Di-Ammonium-Phosphate, a product that entered the market in March 2023.
 
 
 In this Opinion Paper, we compare the claims made by IFFCO scientists to the existing scientific evidence in the field of foliar nanofertilizers.
 
 
 We observe that NU is a poorly described product with no scientifically proven effects. The product is marketed with misleading and wrong statements about its fertilizer efficiency, the underlying plant uptake pathways, and the environmental friendliness.
 
 
 The expectations raised by IFFCO are far from reality and may lead to large-scale yield losses with serious consequences for food security and the livelihood of farmers. At the same time, the confidence in innovative sustainable products as well as the science behind them may be threatened. Based on the IFFCO case, and considering the booming emergence of novel nano based fertilizers appearing all over the world these years, it is clear that much more priority should be given to scientifically prove their efficacy and mode of action, before they are launched on the markets.

PEs therefore might be useful within intervention research. We sought to systematically determine the incidence and persistence of PEs in the general population. Study Design A double-blind search of databases (Embase, Pubmed PMC, Psychinfo, Medline, and Web of Science) from inception to January 2023 and data extraction, were conducted. Study quality was assessed using the NIH assessment tool. Random effects models were conducted to calculate pooled incidence rate per person-year and proportion of persistent PEs per year. Age and study design were all examined using subgroup analyses. Demographic, risk factors, and outcomes for incidence and persistence of PEs were reported in a narrative synthesis. Study Results Using a double-blind screening method for abstract (k = 5763) and full text (k = 250) were screened. In total 91 samples from 71 studies were included, of which 39 were included in a meta-analysis (incidence: k = 17, n = 56 089; persistence: k = 22, n = 81 847). Incidence rate was 0.023 per person-year (95% CI [0.0129;0.0322]). That is, for every 100 people, 2 reported first onset PEs in a year. This was highest in adolescence at 5 per 100(13–17 years). The pooled persistence rate for PEs was 31.0% (95% CI [26.65,35.35]) This was highest in adolescence at 35.8%. Cannabis was particularly associated with incidence of PEs, and persistence of PEs were associated with multiple mental disorders. Conclusions Each year incidence of PEs is 2 of every 100 people, and persists each year in 31% of cases, this risk is highest in adolescents.",Schizophrenia bulletin,2023.0,31,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/schbul/sbad056/50001287/sbad056.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10318880, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The purpose is to analyze the impact of management decisions on the performance indicators of the university in the conditions of temporary occupation and relocation to a new place. The relocation of Berdyansk State Pedagogical University (BSPU) to a safer territory enabled the resumption of educational activities in May 2022, after 53 days of functioning under occupation by russian troops. University staff decreased by 13%, with 57% moving to Ukraine-controlled territories and 43% remaining in the occupied zone. In addition, the student contingent decreased by 15%. The university’s scientific activity during the war decreased for only 9% in publication activity, and funding for science in 2023 increased by 379% compared to 2021. The university continued its third mission of social cooperation by providing humanitarian and psychological assistance and documenting the testimonies of people affected by the occupation. The university community currently exists in a virtual format, with staff and students in different parts of Ukraine and the world. The university must look to the future and overcome existing problems, such as preserving academic potential and student contingent, restoring electronic systems, and continuing pedagogical education.

b5325c6e96f4baa7a415f9c52526653d96f69e07,The algorithm to determine the highest priority of enrollees in the 2023 admissions campaign,"В 2023 году вступили в силу изменения в части процедуры организации и проведения приема на обучение по образовательным программам высшего образования – программам бакалавриата, программам специалитета, программам магистратуры на 2023/2024 учебный год. Основное нововведение будущей приемной кампании – зачисление абитуриентов на основании приоритетов. Расстановкой приоритетов поступающий демонстрирует свое желание быть зачисленным на конкретные направления подготовки/специальности в определенной последовательности. Авторами сделан вывод о существовании проблемы, связанной с отсутствием алгоритма, который позволяет автоматически определить высший приоритет абитуриента на каждом этапе зачисления. Таким образом, обозначена цель исследования – разработать соответствующий алгоритм. Рассмотрен алгоритм Гейла-Шепли и сферы его применения, в частности, возможность применения для установления паросочетаний между абитуриентами и конкурсными группами. Сделан вывод, что данный алгоритм не может быть использован образовательными организациями высшего образования при проведении приемной кампании 2023 года в связи с имеющимися допущениями в его работе. Предложены собственные методы решения задачи определения высшего приоритета в соответствии с утвержденными правилами приема на 2023/2024 учебный год. В статье представлена математическая модель задачи и разработанная вычислительная часть компьютерной программы на языке программирования Python. Апробация алгоритма будет осуществляться в ГУМРФ имени адмирала С.О. Макарова при проведении приемной кампании 2023 года. Материалы статьи представляют практическую ценность для приемных комиссий образовательных организаций.
 In 2023, changes to the admissions procedure came into force which affected enrollment in educational programs of higher education – bachelor's programs, specialty programs, master's programs for the academic year 2023/2024. The main innovation of the future admission campaign is the enrollment of applicants based on priorities. By prioritization, the applicant demonstrates his or her desire to be enrolled in specific fields of study in a particular order. The authors concluded that there is a problem associated with the lack of an algorithm that helps to automatically determine the highest priorities of the applicant at each stage of enrollment. Therefore, the purpose of the study is indicated – to develop an appropriate algorithm. The Gale-Shapley algorithm and its scope are considered – in particular, the possibility of using it to stable matching between applicants and competition groups. It was concluded that this algorithm cannot be employed by educational organizations of higher education in the 2023 admissions campaign due to the existing assumptions in its operation. We have proposed our own methods for solving the problem of determining the highest priorities according to the approved admission rules for the academic year 2023/2024. The article presents a mathematical model of the problem and the computational part of a computer program using Python programming language. The algorithm will be tested at Admiral Makarov State University Maritime and Inland Shipping during the admission campaign in 2023. The materials of the article are of practical value for the admission commissions of educational organizations.","МОДЕЛИРОВАНИЕ, ОПТИМИЗАЦИЯ И ИНФОРМАЦИОННЫЕ ТЕХНОЛОГИИ",2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.26102/2310-6018/2023.42.3.026?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.26102/2310-6018/2023.42.3.026, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

82aaac9ee848017a947b856a9186c1787f305d85,GTH 2023: The Patient as a Benchmark,"Dear colleagues and friends, It is our great honor and pleasure to serve as guest editors for the congress issue of HÄMOSTASEOLOGIE Progress in Haemostasis on the occasion of the 67th Annual Meeting of the Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis Research (GTH), which will be held in Frankfurt am Main in February 2023. After 25 years, our annual meeting will again take place in the Rhine-Mainmetropolis, in the green heart of Germany, at one of the largest andmost modern trade fairs in Europe, the Messe Frankfurt. In recent years, there has been a groundbreaking increase in knowledge in haemostaseology, both preclinically in basic research and clinically in the development of innovative diagnostic and treatment strategies. In linewith the congress motto “The patient as the benchmark,” we aim to highlight the latest developments in research in the field of haemostaseology with regard to their impact on the current and future care of our patients. The focus on communicating the latest patient-relevant scientific findings is also reflected on the afternoon of the last day of the congress, where selected topics are communicated to practicing and clinically active colleagues, also from other disciplines. In parallel, the presentation of patient organizations with lectures on current topics will take place. Years after the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we hope to see many active contributions and exciting interactions, forwhich attractive opportunities have been created in the scientific program and in the industry exhibition. Special attentionwill be given to the discussion of controversial topics, which we have brought together in four Pro and Con sessions. Finally, another important aspect of this congress is the support of young haemostaseologists with a basic science methods seminar on methods of platelet research and a workshop on grant writing and publication writing. We are also pleased that last year’s young GTH awardees will be able to present and discuss their work in a dedicated scientific symposium. We are particularly delighted to welcome distinguished researchers and physicians who are leaders in the field of thrombosis and hemostasis to present their latest data at the 67th GTH Annual Meeting. In this issue of HÄMOSTASEOLOGIE Progress in Haemostasis, the speakers of the 67th Annual Meeting present the latest data from their area of expertise. The various contributions range from evidence-based medicine to laboratory diagnostics and new anticoagulants and illustrate very well the complexity of our scientific discipline with many points of connection to other disciplines. To underline the interdisciplinary character of haemostaseology with other scientific societies, we have planned joint sessions with Deutsche Gesellschaft für Hämatologie und Medizinische Onkologie (DGHO), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Chirurgie (DGCH), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhämatologie (DGTI), and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Klinische Chemie und Laboratoriumsmedizin (DGKL). The concept of patient blood management (PBM) has the potential to significantly improve perioperative patient care when its implementation is guided by substantiated recommendations that follow the principles of evidence-based medicine. Vandekerckhove’s plenary lecture focuses on the principles and values of evidence-based medicine as illustrated by PBM and has been summarized in the article by Van Remoortel et al.1 The article by Uzun and colleagues2 describes a retrospective analysis of the performance of a particle gel immunosorbent assay in detecting anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies in the setting of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. This elegantly introduces the plenary lecture by Bakchoul on thrombocytopenia in inflammatory diseases.

Recent evidence suggests a potential role of microRNAs (miRNAs) as feasible biomarkers for the early diagnosis of endometriosis. Following the recommendations in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, we systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct in January 2023. We provided no restriction on the country and year of publication, and considered English published articles. We selected studies including patients with endometriosis and describing miRNA regulation in the context of endometriosis. Overall, 45 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and 2045 patients with endometriosis and 1587 controls were screened. Patients were analyzed concerning miRNAs expression and sources, stage of disease, and symptoms, and compared to controls. Among DEMs, the ones with the widest delta between endometriosis patients and controls—Relative Expression ≥ 4 Log2(ratio)—were miR-145, miR-191, miR-195, miR-21-5p, miR-106b-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-451a, miR-200c, miR-20a-5p, and miR-15a-5p.

However, the effects of HOPE on morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation remain unclear. This meta-analysis evaluated the potential benefits of HOPE in liver transplantation. Materials and methods: The Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched for articles published up to 15 June 2023 (updated on 12 August 2023). Mean differences (MDs), risk ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: Eleven studies encompassing five randomized controlled trials and six matched studies were included, with a total of 1000 patients. HOPE did not reduce the incidence of major postoperative complications (RR 0.80), primary non-function (PNF) (RR 0.54), reperfusion syndrome (RR 0.92), hepatic artery thrombosis (RR 0.92), renal replacement therapy (RR 0.98), length of hospital stay (MD, −1.38 days), 1-year recipient death (RR 0.67), or intensive care unit stay (MD, 0.19 days) after liver transplantation. HOPE reduced the incidence of biliary complications (RR 0.74), non-anastomotic biliary strictures (NAS) (RR 0.34), early allograft dysfunction (EAD) (RR 0.54), and acute rejection (RR 0.54). In addition, HOPE improved the retransplantation (RR 0.42) and 1-year graft loss rates (RR 0.38). Conclusions: Compared with static cold storage (SCS), HOPE can reduce the incidence of biliary complications, NAS, EAD, and acute rejection and retransplantation rate after liver transplantation and improve the 1-year graft loss rate. These findings suggest that HOPE, when compared to SCS, can contribute to minimizing complications and enhancing graft survival in liver transplantation.

AutoNav has set multiple planetary rover records, including the greatest distance driven without human review (699.9 meters) and the greatest single-day drive distance (347.7 meters). The Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science (AEGIS) system analyzes wide-angle imagery onboard to autonomously select targets for observations by the SuperCam instrument, a multimode sensor suite capable of millimeter-scale geochemical and mineralogical analysis. AEGIS enables observations of scientifically interesting targets during or immediately after long drives without the need for ground communication. OnBoard Planner (OBP) is a scheduling capability planned for operational use in September 2023 that has the potential to reduce energy usage by up to 20% and complete drive and arm-contact science campaigns in 25% fewer days on Mars. This paper presents an overview of the AutoNav, AEGIS, and OBP capabilities used on Perseverance.

Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses) and MOOSE (Meta‐Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from January 1, 2013 to August 6, 2023. Observational studies reporting seizure and memory outcomes among different HS subtypes were included. We used the Newcastle–Ottawa scale to assess the risk of bias and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to grade the quality of evidence. Seizure freedom and improved outcome (Engel 1 or ILAE class 1–2) ≥1 year after surgery were defined as the primary and secondary seizure outcome. A random‐effects meta‐analysis by DerSimonian and Laird method was performed to obtain pooled risk ratio (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs). The memory impairment was narratively reviewed because of various evaluation tools. Fifteen cohort studies with 2485 patients were eligible for the meta‐analysis of seizure outcome. Six cohorts with detailed information on postoperative memory outcome were included. The pooled RRs of seizure freedom, with moderate to substantial heterogeneity, were .98 (95% CI = .84–1.15) between HS type 2 and type 1, 1.11 (95% CI = .82–1.52) between type 3 and type 1, and .80 (95% CI = .62–1.03) between the no‐HS and HS groups. No significant difference of improved outcome was found between different subtypes (p > .05). The quality of evidence was deemed to be low to very low according to GRADE.

No study has evaluated this literature from a bibliometric perspective. This bibliometric study analyzed the relevant research literature indexed in Web of Science, to unveil its growth and the most productive authors, institutions, countries, journals, and journal categories. In addition, this study aimed to identify the recurring themes of the literature. On July 2023, the Web of Science Core Collection database was accessed with the following search query: TS = (*mogroside* OR “luo han guo” OR “lo han kuo” OR “monk fruit*” OR “monkfruit*” OR “Siraitia grosvenorii”) AND TS = (sweet*). The search identified publications mentioning these terms in their title, abstract, or keywords. Only articles and reviews were included. No additional filters were placed on publication year, language, etc. Basic publication and citation frequency counts were recorded directly from the database. The complete record of the publications were exported into VOSviewer and CRExplorer, for visualization of recurring terms and identification of commonly cited references, respectively. The search yielded 155 publications. Publication and citation counts have increased steadily since the 2010s. The most productive authors and institutions were mostly based in Asian countries, such as China, Japan, and Singapore. Nearly half of the publications had contributions from China and were published in journals concerning food science technology. The health effects and biosynthesis of mogrosides were the recurring themes among the top 10 most cited publications. Most of the health effects, such as anti-hyperglycemic, anti-hyperlipidemic, and anti-diabetic properties, were demonstrated in animal models with limited evidence from clinical trials. Future studies should focus on testing in humans. Since monk fruit extracts were generally recognized as safe (GRAS) according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the affirmation of these health benefits in humans by future studies should advocate its use in the food industry and the society to generally improve the public health.",Frontiers in Nutrition,2023.0,9,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1253255/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10495570, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

306f7e19768f927f3272cbe6e94d80d8b2d1bf8d,Recent Developments in Ultralarge and Structure-Based Virtual Screening Approaches.,"Drug development is a wide scientific field that faces many challenges these days. Among them are extremely high development costs, long development times, and a small number of new drugs that are approved each year. New and innovative technologies are needed to solve these problems that make the drug discovery process of small molecules more time and cost efficient, and that allow previously undruggable receptor classes to be targeted, such as protein-protein interactions. Structure-based virtual screenings (SBVSs) have become a leading contender in this context. In this review, we give an introduction to the foundations of SBVSs and survey their progress in the past few years with a focus on ultralarge virtual screenings (ULVSs). We outline key principles of SBVSs, recent success stories, new screening techniques, available deep learning-based docking methods, and promising future research directions. ULVSs have an enormous potential for the development of new small-molecule drugs and are already starting to transform early-stage drug discovery.

Hence, this study aimed to evaluate Awareness, Perceptions, and Opinions towards Artificial intelligence (AI) among pharmacy undergraduate students at King Saud University (KSU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted between December 2022 and January 2023 using online questionnaires. The data collection was carried out using convenience sampling methods among senior pharmacy students at the College of Pharmacy, King Saud University. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26 was used to analyze the data (SPSS). Results: A total of one hundred and fifty-seven pharmacy students completed the questionnaires. Of these, most of them (n = 118; 75.2%) were males. About 42%, (n = 65) were in their fourth year of study. Most of the students (n = 116; 73.9%) knew about AI. In addition, 69.4% (n = 109) of the students thought that AI is a tool that helps healthcare professionals (HCP). However, more than half 57.3% (n = 90) of the students were aware that AI would assist healthcare professionals in becoming better with the widespread use of AI. Furthermore, 75.1% of the students agreed that AI reduces errors in medical practice. The mean positive perception score was 29.8 (SD = 9.63; range-0–38). The mean score was significantly associated with age (p = 0.030), year of study (p = 0.040), and nationality (p = 0.013). The gender of the participants was found to have no significant association with the mean positive perception score (p = 0.916). Conclusions: Overall, pharmacy students showed good awareness of AI in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the majority of the students had positive perceptions about the concepts, benefits, and implementation of AI. Moreover, most students indicated that there is a need for more education and training in the field of AI. Consequently, early exposure to content related to AI in the curriculum of pharmacy is an important step to help in the wide use of these technologies in the graduates’ future careers.",Medicina,2023.0,63,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/59/5/828/pdf?version=1682336414', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10221309, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There were 25 teachers in the participant group, of whom 7 were female and 18 were male. The data in this study, in which a phenomenological design was used, were collected using the semi-structured interview technique. The data analysis, which employed two different methods, namely descriptive and content analysis, was completed with a computer-aided qualitative analysis program. As far as the results obtained in the study are concerned, it can be said that the teachers predominantly had negative views about their job satisfaction. The outstanding factors for teachers’ job satisfaction were intrinsic motivation, physical conditions of the school, communication with the school administration, socio-economic level, and respect for the profession. In this sense, it is believed that strong communication established between the school administration and teachers, the improvement of the physical conditions in schools, and fair wage policies will contribute positively to the job satisfaction of teachers.",International Journal of Research in Education and Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ijres.net/index.php/ijres/article/download/3245/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.46328/ijres.3245?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.46328/ijres.3245, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) has been specifically developed to manage wide neck bifurcation intracranial aneurysms. A wide range of aneurysm occlusion rates and device-related complications are reported in different papers, and a lack of collective evidence in this regard.


OBJECTIVE
To clarify the long-term efficacy and safety outcomes of intracranial aneurysm treatment with WEB devices.


METHODS
A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases on April 25, 2023. Considering the eligibility criteria, all the studies reporting the outcomes of the intracranial aneurysm treatment with WEB device at 1 and/or more than 1 year were included. Data elements of interest were extracted and analyzed using R software version 4.2.1.


RESULTS
Twenty-seven articles were included. Complete occlusion rate was 56.85%, 67.10%, and 56.34% at one year, beyond one year, and at/beyond two years of follow-up, respectively. Adequate occlusion rate was 87.11% at one year, 91.16% beyond one year, and 88.87% at/beyond two years of follow-up. WEB compression and aneurysm recurrence rates increased from 17.62% and 0.58% at one year to 42.59% and 18.99% beyond one year of follow-up, respectively. An increase in retreatment rate from 3.45% at one year to 7.15% beyond one year of follow-up was found.


CONCLUSION
The current study supports the long-term efficacy of WEB devices for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. However, an increase in WEB compression, aneurysm recurrence, and retreatment rates beyond one year reveals the importance of follow-ups after the first year of WEB placement.",Interventional Neuroradiology,2023.0,8,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/15910199231184524?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/15910199231184524, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of L-carnitine supplementation on NAFLD. Methods We searched in four databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) from inception to 1 November 2022 (updated on March 20, 2023) for potentially relevant records without language restrictions. We collected information on the first author, publication year, country, setting, study design, population characteristics, duration of follow-up, outcome variables of interest, and sources of funding. We used a modified Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the risk of bias, used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence, and used the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN) tool to assess the credibility of any apparent subgroup effect. Results This systematic review and meta-analysis included eight eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Compared to placebo, low certainty evidence show that L-carnitine supplementation significantly changes (reduced) more in AST levels and ALT levels (MD: − 26.38, 95%CI: − 45.46 to − 7.30), and moderate certainty evidence show that L-carnitine supplementation significantly changes (reduced) more in HDL cholesterol levels (MD: 1.14, 95%CI: 0.21 to 2.07) and triglyceride levels (MD: − 6.92, 95%CI: − 13.82 to − 0.03). Moderate credibility of ICEMAN results shows that L-carnitine supplementation has no difference in changes of AST and ALT levels in younger ones (MD: 0.5, 95%CI: − 0.70 to 1.70) but has significant changes (reduced) in adults (MD: − 20.3, 95%CI: − 28.62 to − 12.28) compared to placebo.

Method PubMed, EMBASE, web of science and Cochrane Library was interrogated to identify Electronic bibliographic studies updated to January 2023 to collect studies compared the clinical outcomes of endovascular repair for Acute Versus Subacute Uncomplicated Type B Aortic Dissection. Data were aggregated as pooled odds ratios (OR) using the fixed or random effects models according to the significance of heterogeneity, Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated by RevMan 5.3 and applied with fixed or random-effect models. Result A comprehensive literature search found 322 citations published and finally among them 6 studies containing 3,769 patients (acute group 2,642, subacute group 1,127) were included in review. There is an increased risk of 30-day complications (OR = 1.51,95%CI,1.26–1.81) 30-day mortality (OR = 2.39,95%CI, 1.55–3.67) and 1-year mortality (OR = 1.71,95%CI,1.27–2.30) for an acute uTBAD group compared to subacute ones. Similarly, reintervention was more likely in the acute group than in the subacute group (OR = 1.42,95%CI,1.05–1.91). However, no significant differences were found in long-term mortality. Conclusion This meta-analysis confirmed that there was no significant difference in the long-term prognosis between the acute and subacute phases in the timing of surgery. However, considering the high incidence of complications, high re-intervention rate and one-year mortality probably caused by high intima fragility in the acute phase, endovascular repair at subacute phase appears to favorably compare with acute strategy. But future studies with adequate patient numbers and longer-term follow-up are necessary to further verify the study conclusion.

c29a6064cf730fea85b9809beb942c701855be60,Improvements in swine herd biosecurity reduce the incidence risk of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in breeding herds in the Midwestern United States.,"OBJECTIVE
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a significant disease of swine. The purpose of this study was to determine whether application of a comprehensive, science-based approach to breeding herd biosecurity, known as next-generation biosecurity (NGB), could reduce PRRS incidence risk across a large commercial production company.


ANIMALS
Pigs (381,404 sows across 76 breeding herds).


METHODS
From 2009 to 2020, the annual incidence risk of PRRS in sow farms managed by the same company averaged 33%, ranging from 20% to 50%. To measure the effect of NGB on PRRS incidence risk, a retrospective cohort study was conducted from July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2023, across breeding herds managed by the same company. During the analysis, 2 groups of herds emerged: those that implemented protocols for all phases of NGB (NGB COMPLETE), and those that implemented all described protocols of biosecurity except for air filtration (NGB INCOMPLETE).


RESULTS
During the 2-year assessment period, 56 breeding herds were classified as NGB COMPLETE, while 20 herds were NGB INCOMPLETE. The PRRS incidence risk in NGB COMPLETE herds was 8.9% as compared to 40.0% in NGB INCOMPLETE herds. From disease year 1 (July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022) and disease year 2 (July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023), system-wide PRRS incidence risk was 8.6% and 9.2%, respectively. The association between NGB status and PRRS incidence risk for the 2-year period was statistically significant at a P value of .006.

CONCLUSIONS
Twenty-six of 1,568 screened studies (> 1,228 patients) were included. Six studies were high quality and 20 were medium quality. Studies identified various symptoms that may be partially attributable to ankyloglossia after infancy, including speech/articulation difficulties, eating difficulties, dysphagia, sleep-disordered breathing symptoms, dental malocclusion, and social embarrassment such as oral hygiene issues. Multiple comparative studies found associations between ankyloglossia and risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea; a randomized controlled trial found that frenotomy may attenuate apnea severity. Ankyloglossia may also promote dental crowding.


IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
Ankyloglossia may be associated with myriad effects on children's quality of life that extend beyond breastfeeding, but current data regarding the impact are inconclusive. This review provides a map of symptoms that providers may want to evaluate as we continue to debate the decision to proceed with frenotomy or nonsurgical therapies in children with ankyloglossia. A continuing need exists for controlled efficacy research on frenotomy for symptoms in older children and on possible longitudinal benefits of early frenotomy for maxillofacial development.

Based on the results of observations at SMAN 1 Sitiung students have not used e-modules but use electronic teaching materials in the form of pdf files downloaded from the internet and only in the form of writing and a few pictures. Based on the questionnaire results, it is known that students have difficulty understanding the concept of the respiratory system material. This causes low student learning outcomes as evidenced by the daily test scores that are still below the minimum completeness criteria. So, it takes teaching materials that can help in visualizing the subject matter. This type of research is Plomp model development research which consists of three stages: the initial investigation stage, the development or prototyping stage, and the assessment stage. The research subjects were class XI students at SMAN 1 Sitiung for the 2022-2023 academic year.

The ideas and concepts of “Cultural frame of reference” and “Cross-cultural frame of reference” were already introduced by us in passing in our papers on the certainty uncertainty principle, cross-cultural research design, structured apperception tests, extended identity theory, ethnography of enculturation, and twenty-first century intellectualism, all of which were published in the year 2023. This issue is not a trifle or a bagatelle, and not certainly a laughing matter. It therefore deserves to be studied in all seriousness by social sciences researchers. It has several practical applications in fields such as social and cultural change and betterment, religious reform, the design of contemporary education systems, cross-cultural research design, behavioural studies, and even technological advancement and betterment. These concepts must be brought into fruition through the use of various social science research techniques such as ethnography, fieldwork, the participant observation method, interviews, questionnaires, emic studies, and the like.

Early detection and treatment are crucial, but stigma can prevent people from seeking help. Primary care providers can play a critical role in early detection by coordinating care with other professionals. Understanding the research landscape on EDs, primary care, and stigma is essential for identifying knowledge gaps to direct future research and improve management. In this study, we aimed to analyze the scientific trends and patterns in research about EDs, primary care, and stigma. A bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Web of Science database to collect articles published between May 1986 and May 2023. Bibliometric indicators were utilized to examine authorship, collaboration patterns, and influential papers. Topic analysis was performed to identify stigma-related terms within the dataset. A total of 541 research articles were analyzed, and it was found that the average number of publications per year has increased linearly from nearly zero in 1986 to 41 in 2022. One of the study’s main findings is that despite this linear increase over the years, the subject of stigma did not take a prominent place in the literature. Only a few stigma concepts could be identified with the topic analysis. The authors in the field are also interested in; screening, neurotic symptoms, training, adolescent, obesity-related conditions, and family. One-third of all publications were from 15 journals. However, only two of them were primary healthcare journals. Leading authors’ collaborations were another critical finding from the network analysis. This may help to expand primary care related EDs research to end the mental health stigma. This study provides insights into the research trends and patterns regarding eating disorders, primary care, and stigma. Our findings highlight the need to address primary care’s impact and stigma on EDs. The identified research gaps can guide future studies to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders in primary care settings.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2023.0,4,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1243922/pdf?isPublishedV2=False', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10570408, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is necessary to understand the mechanisms associated with suicidal behavior. Recently, an increase in gene expression studies has been in development. Through a systematic review, we aimed to find a candidate gene in gene expression studies on postmortem brains of suicide completers. Databases were systematically searched for published studies. We performed an online search using PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases to search studies up until May 2023. The terms included were “gene expression”, “expressed genes”, “microarray”, “qRT–PCR”, “brain samples” and “suicide”. Our systematic review included 59 studies covering the analysis of 1450 brain tissues from individuals who died by suicide. The majority of gene expression profiles were obtained of the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventral prefrontal cortex and orbital frontal cortex area. The most studied mRNAs came of genes in glutamate, γ-amino-butyric acid and polyamine systems. mRNAs of genes in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), HPA axis and chemokine family were also studied.

This disorder is associated with expressive and receptive anomia, word comprehension deficits, and behavioral symptoms such as apathy, loss of empathy, and disinhibition, all of which closely correlate with functional impairment in daily activities. Despite substantial efforts, research on occupational therapy (OT) interventions has yet to demonstrate clear benefits in managing the disease. The aim of this study is to investigate OT interventions and assess their efficacy, with a specific focus on individuals suffering from FTD. We systematically conducted searches on two databases, namely Medline and Science Direct, spanning a ten-year period from 2003 to 2023, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. OT interventions targeted both patients and caregivers and yielded significant positive improvements in their lives. A key focus of these interventions was to teach acceptable alternatives to the behaviors exhibited by FTD patients, as these behaviors are strongly influenced by the disease itself.

Through Industry 4.0, also referred to as the fourth industrial revolution, new technologies or traditional production resources have been transformed into intelligent objects enhanced by the possibility of identification, scanning, and networking. In recent years, the concept of Industry 5.0 has already started to be discussed. However, is Industry 4.0 an uninteresting or sufficiently researched topic for scientists? The main aim of the scientific article is to perform a bibliometric analysis of the Industry 4.0 issue. The aim was supported by six research questions that reflect the publication trend in the years 2012–2022, the most publishing countries, the most used keywords, the Web of Science category, and authors and publishers. Design / Methodology / Approach. The data was obtained from the renowned Web of Science database. The monitored period was 2012–2022 for Industry 4.0 and 2016-2022 for Industry 5.0. The year 2023 was excluded from the analysis, as the year 2023 is not finished. The total number of publications that were used in the bibliometric analysis was 20,151 (I4.0) and 293 (I5.0). VOSviewer and MS Excel were used for graphical data processing. Findings. The oldest publication dedicated to Industry 4.0 in the Web of Science database dates back to 2012. The most scientific articles were seen in 2021, namely 4,326 (I4.0) and 201 in 2022 about I5.0. In 2022, 3848 publications were published. In addition, authors from Germany (2,450), Italy (2,318), China (1,515), and the USA (1,220) address the issue of Industry 4.0. All the countries of the Visegrad Group, Poland (859), the Czech Republic (859), Slovakia (539), and Hungary (282) are most concerned with this problem. If the publications are divided into categories according to the Web of Science database, most of them are included in the categories Engineering Industrial, Engineering Manufacturing, Engineering Electrical Electronic, Computer Science Theory Methods, or Computer Science Information Systems. Publications on Industry 4.0 are published mainly by publishers such as IEEE, Elsevier, Springer, and MDPI. The authors who are most devoted to the mentioned issue are Popkova, Martinek, Rauch, Bogoviz, Silva, and Xu. Originality / Value / Practical implications. The added value of the scientific article is the summarisation of theoretical starting points from the field of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. Likewise, the article is original from the point of view of conducting a bibliometric analysis, focused on the development of the number of publications, the authors who are most devoted to the given topic, the most commonly used keywords, or countries that focus on Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 issues the most.

7aa03af4631f58b15e262022aedea39054b44ca1,Role Of The Family As Supervisors Of Tuberculosis Medication Adherence,"Effective TB treatment involves consistent and timely administration of anti-TB drugs over a sufficiently long period. However, the problem of non-compliance with treatment is common and can result in treatment failure, spread of infection, and drug resistance. This study aims to examine the role of the family as a supervisor in monitoring medication adherence in TB patients. The literature search process in this literature review uses several databases, namely Google Scholar, Science Direct, and PubMed, with the publication year of 2018-2023. The results of this study are expected to provide better insight into the role of the family in supervising medication adherence in TB patients. With a better understanding of the factors influencing family roles, more effective steps can be taken to improve adherence to TB treatment. Our advice as writers is that anyone appointed as a supervisor of swallowing medicine, both nurses and patients' families, must carry out their duties in supervising patients taking medicine. This is because TB is a severe infectious disease, and the way to overcome it is by taking medication regularly and on time. Therefore, the role of drug-swallowing supervisors is needed in this case.",International Journal of Midwifery and Health Sciences,2023.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.61777/ijmhs.v1i3.51?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.61777/ijmhs.v1i3.51, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Next-generation sequencing can solve the issue of not only diagnosis but also the further treatment of lung cancer.
Aim. The work aims to search, process, generalize and bibliometrically analyze the scientific literature to study the main trends in next-generation sequencing in diagnosing non-small cell lung cancer.
Materials and methods. One thousand nine hundred thirty-one literature sources, including information about next-generation sequencing, were published between 2010 and 2023. The data search was carried out in electronic databases Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using keywords: ""lung cancer,"" ""next-generation sequencing,"" ""targeted therapy,"" ""genetic mutations,"" ""circulating tumor DNA,"" and ""liquid biopsy."" The authors used the bibliometric tools of the Scopus and SciVal databases to analyze the year, source, type of study, subject area, and country of publication.
Results and discussion. Next-generation sequencing is gradually becoming the new diagnostic standard. This technology allows to detect biological markers with high accuracy and specificity. Many studies have confirmed the effectiveness of next-generation sequencing for diagnosing lung cancer, assessing response to treatment and sensitivity to drug therapy, and predicting the prognosis of the disease. Lung cancer is one of the most common tumors with a high mutational load. Unique diagnostic panels allow for a short period to examine tumor tissue for a wide range of biological markers. The article aims to investigate the main areas of application of next-generation sequencing in patients with lung cancer and current clinical trials in this field. The bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature consisted of the study of publication activity from 2010 to 2023, the geography of publications, and the identification of scientific journals where the articles about the role of next-generation sequencing were publicized.
Conclusions. Next-generation sequencing is widely used in medicine. This method can become one of the leading methods for diagnosing lung cancer because it can accurately identify specific biological markers. Tumor tissue embedded in paraffin blocks and various biological fluids can be used for diagnosis. Next-generation sequencing is effective even in cases where the amount of tumor tissue is limited and other methods cannot identify it. The advantages of the method are confirmed in clinical trials and described in many scientific publications of the leading countries of the world. As a result, next-generation sequencing appears to be an effective method for diagnosing lung cancer and selecting the most appropriate regimen of targeted or immunotherapy. Disadvantages of the method include the high cost in developing countries and the need for appropriate software.",Eastern Ukrainian Medical Journal,2023.0,3,"{'url': 'https://eumj.med.sumdu.edu.ua/index.php/journal/article/download/354/245', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21272/eumj.2023;11(3):214-223?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21272/eumj.2023;11(3):214-223, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The extent of the absorption of heavy metals and gases by Sphagnopsida moss under different conditions was investigated. The efficiency of air purification with biotechnological filters was also investigated in the city of Almaty, Republic of Kazakhstan, where an excess of the permissible concentration of harmful substances in the air, according to the WHO air quality guidelines, is recorded throughout the year. Data on the level of pollution recorded with sensors located in the largest Kazakhstani cities from 21 June 2020 to 4 June 2023 were selected as the basis for calculating purification efficiency. In total, there are 220 in 73 settlements of the Republic of Kazakhstan, with 80 such sensors located in the city of Almaty. Since creating a single biotechnological filter is expensive, our task was to calculate the air purification effect in the case of increasing the number of filters placed in polluted areas. We show that 10 filters provide an air purification efficiency of 0.77%, with 100 filters providing an air purification efficiency of 5.72% and 500 filters providing an air purification efficiency of 23.11%. A biotechnological filter for air purification based on moss was designed at Astana IT University by taking into consideration the climatic features, distribution, and types of pollution in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The obtained results are essential for ensuring compliance with the standard for environmental comfort in the Republic of Kazakhstan.

We also revisit various other contemporary theories on human classification including anthropometric and genetic ones. We also summarize the principles, concepts and tenets of our paper of the ‘Certainty uncertainty principle’ for the social sciences which was published by us early in the year 2023, and show how the principles of this paper can be used to demonstrate how and why racism and scientific racism are highly dubious and questionable concepts. Even though these concepts have been more or less jettisoned by mainstream researchers and scientists, they continue to linger on in the collective imagination of the common folk, who harbour qualms and inhibitions about the absolute equality of all humans. We also discuss the ‘Flynn effect’ in all its ramifications, and propose the ‘Comprehensive socio-cultural persecution complex’ to account for alleged differences in IQ scores from across cultures and societies. We also not only discuss the merits and demerits of IQ tests, but also review the concepts of persecution complex, discrimination complex, and inferiority complex. Of course, the objective of any form of research is to get to the truth, and we stand steadfastly by this principle at all times. We only recommend that certain factors based on the ‘Certainty uncertainty principle’ for the social science must be isolated before getting to the absolute truth which would be the ultimate goal of any meaningful research.",Social Science Research Network,2023.0,3,"{'url': 'https://zenodo.org/records/10799328/files/Sujay%20Quashing%20racism%20FINAL%20FINAL%20FINAL%20FINAL%20FINAL.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/ssrn.4581791?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4581791, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d4d027670a00d3d301db1efbc4c8a2d9633409e8,Evidence from a meta-analysis and systematic review reveals the global prevalence of mild cognitive impairment,"Objective Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a preclinical and transitional stage between healthy ageing and dementia. The purpose of our study was to investigate the recent pooled global prevalence of MCI. Methods This meta-analysis was in line with the recommendations of Cochrane’s Handbook and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020. We conducted a comprehensive search using the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, WFD, VIP, and CBM from their inception to March 1, 2023. Quality assessment was guided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) methodology checklist. The pooled global prevalence of MCI was synthesized using meta-analysis via random effect model. Subgroup analyses were performed to examine considered factors potentially associated with MCI prevalence. Results We identified 233 studies involving 676,974 individuals aged above 50 years. All the studies rated as moderated-to-high quality. The overall prevalence of MCI was 19.7% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 18.3–21.1%]. Subgroup analyses revealed that the global prevalence of MCI increased over time, with a significant rise [32.1% (95% CI: 22.6–41.6%)] after 2019. Additionally, MCI prevalence in hospitals [34.0% (95% CI: 22.2–45.7%)] was higher than in nursing homes [22.6% (95% CI: 15.5–29.8%)] and communities [17.9% (95% CI: 16.6–19.2%)], particularly after the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Conclusion The global prevalence of MCI was 19.7% and mainly correlated with beginning year of survey and sample source. The MCI prevalence increased largely in hospitals after 2019 may be related to the outbreak of COVID-19.

In the world of education today there are still many learning methods that use conventional learning models, namely students only listen to the teacher explaining the subject matter, without any action or activity as a learning experience. Learning activities like this, cause the results achieved by students in learning are not maximized, because students are only able to memorize facts, concepts, principles and theories. This study discusses efforts to improve student learning outcomes through TGT type cooperative learning. This study aims to obtain information about improving science learning outcomes for third grade students in the 2022/2023 school year through cooperative learning of the TGT type. The formulation of the problem in this study is: can the learning outcomes of class III students at SDK WILAIN be improved through the TGT Cooperative model. The object of research in this study were all Class III students of SDK WILAIN, totaling 16 people. The research instruments used in data collection were observation guidelines and test results after the action was taken. The data analysis technique used is descriptive statistical analysis and inferential statistical analysis. Based on the initial survey conducted by the author, teachers who only used the lecture method resulted in low interest in learning and student learning outcomes in class III. Likewise for science subjects at SDK WILAIN, according to the documentation in the form of subject scores obtained from subject teachers, only 5 people (31.25%) out of 16 students showed high interest in learning that met the KKM (Minimum Completeness Criteria determined by For this reason, a new learning strategy is needed to improve the quality of the science learning process so that it has an impact on student learning outcomes.By using the Team Games Tournament (TGT) cooperative learning method, it is hoped that it can increase student learning interest. 
The results showed that there was an increase in student learning outcomes before and after the implementation of the TGT cooperative model. The score of students' interest in learning in class III SDK WILAIN before applying the cooperative model was 31.25%, which met the minimum completeness criteria or were in the low category. While the learning outcomes of third grade students at SDK WILAIN after implementing the TGT cooperative model were 87.5% which were in the high category. So the application of the TGT cooperative model can improve the learning achievement of class III students at SDK WILAIN.",JURNAL PENDIDIKAN DAN ILMU SOSIAL (JUPENDIS),2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://jurnal.itbsemarang.ac.id/index.php/JUPENDIS/article/download/82/81', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.54066/jupendis-itb.v1i1.82?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.54066/jupendis-itb.v1i1.82, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

From November 2022 to February 2023, we searched the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Health & Medical Collection, Elsevier Journal, and Springer for relevant studies performing different searches through different search strings. New forms of gambling are mostly related to new technological tools, such as the Internet, smartphones, social media, or electronic machines. The prevalence of online gambling affects all demographic groups, although 35–44-year-olds appear to have the largest share. Online gambling can lead to addiction, financial hardship, and mental health problems. It has also been statistically significantly associated with high levels of Gambling disorder, high levels of depression and anxiety, poor overall mental health, and alcohol use. Furthermore, it has been noted that online gamblers are more likely to engage in high-risk gambling behaviors and have a higher prevalence of comorbid mental disorders.

5990e58b4f2d0bfa86b279d00e8462549bbe8b80,"Digital approach in pedagogy and psychology of the future: trends, globalization challenges","People have been interested in the phenomenon of learning for a very long time. An impressive number of hypotheses and theories of learning have emerged along with the development of human thought and the scientific method of cognition of nature. The use of computers in education has been the subject of much research and debate. Technology has often been seen as a tool to help both teachers and students. Research in related literature has shown that we learn differently and engage in different types of knowledge creation when we use technology. The use of technology in teaching and learning has fueled the development of digital pedagogy. The SCOPUS and Web of Science databases were used to assess the problematic nature of the topic. 144 articles were analyzed, of which 20 articles related to the topic were taken for analysis. This paper analyzes trends in the digital approach to pedagogy and psychology of the future in the context of globalization.

During the 2022-2023 academic year, a survey was conducted in three stages. The empirical study involved 216 teachers of pedagogical faculties from different higher education institutions of Ukraine who filled out a questionnaire through Google forms.

The results of the survey have identified the main ideas of the digital approach to education, made it possible to identify the most popular digital learning tools, outline key areas in the education of the future, and determine the main trend in pedagogy in the face of globalization challenges, namely, a change in the educational paradigm that would allow digital technologies to coexist with traditional educational norms.",Futurity Education,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://futurity-education.com/index.php/fed/article/download/148/94', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.57125/fed.2023.06.25.09?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.57125/fed.2023.06.25.09, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

bf61b8eabeb2f9a2cdae2001de4a2f2c390f751e,Disciplinary trends in the use of the Delphi method: A bibliometric analysis,"The Delphi method is an iterative, anonymous, group-based process for eliciting and aggregating opinion on a topic to explore the existence of consensus among experts. The year 2023 marks the 60th anniversary of the first peer-reviewed journal article on the Delphi method. Originally developed for operations research, this method is now applied extensively by researchers representing diverse scientific fields. We used a bibliometric analysis to describe general trends in the expansion of its use across disciplines over time. We conducted a systematic literature search for all English-language, peer-reviewed journal articles on the Delphi method through its first 60 years. We found 19,831 articles: 96.8% (n = 19,204) on the actual use of the Delphi method in an empirical study and 3.2% (n = 627) describing, examining, or providing some guidance on how to use the Delphi method. Almost half (49.9%) of all articles were published in the 2010s and an additional third (32.5%) in the first few years of the 2020s. Nearly two-thirds (65%, n = 12,883) of all published articles have appeared in medical journals, compared to 15% in science and technology (n = 3,053) or social science (n = 3,016) journals. We conclude that the expanded use of the Delphi method has been driven largely by the medical field, though social scientists and technologists continue to be at the forefront of methodological work on the Delphi method. Therefore, we call for greater transdisciplinary collaboration on methodological guidance and standards for the Delphi method.",PLoS ONE,2023.0,20,"{'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289009&type=printable', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10427003, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Therefore, understanding how students perceive and utilize technologies for educational purposes is crucial. Especially in a critical subject like anatomy education, it is essential to employ various models to determine students' technology acceptance and usage levels. One of these models is the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology‐2 (UTAUT2). In this study, the acceptance and usage levels of metaverse technology by students in the context of anatomy education in the metaverse environment have been investigated within the framework of the UTAUT2 model. The study was conducted with students from the Department of Midwifery at the Faculty of Health Sciences during the fall semester of the 2022–2023 academic year. After 6 weeks of anatomy education in the metaverse environment, the student's acceptance and usage levels of metaverse technology were assessed using the UTAUT2 scale. The collected data were analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling method. The research has revealed the technology acceptance and usage levels of students who utilized metaverse technology in anatomy education. According to the obtained results, it has been observed that social influence affects behavioral intention, facilitating conditions influence behavioral intention, and habit variable affects behavioral intention, while habit, in turn, influences usage. Other variables explain behavioral intention with a proportion of 75.30%, whereas other variables explain usage behavior with 54.90%. Upon analyzing the responses to the UTAUT2 scale, it has been concluded that there is the highest level of participation in hedonic motivation. In contrast, the habit variable has the lowest participation level. The findings of this study have enabled the identification of the impacts of metaverse technologies on anatomy and health education.

One effective method of achieving this is through the development of pocket parks. Although several studies have explored the benefits and design principles of pocket parks, there is a lack of systematic and quantitative understanding, which could influence the decision-making process for the proper adoption of pocket parks. In view of this knowledge gap, this study employs bibliometric methods and critical review to quantitatively analyze and systematically review 276 papers published in the Web of Science and Scopus databases between 1977 and 2023. Firstly, a bibliometric analysis is conducted, providing a comprehensive overview of research on pocket parks. Secondly, a detailed critical review is conducted from three major perspectives: influencing factors, design methods, and benefits of pocket parks. Finally, the research trends and future directions are discussed. The results indicate that (a) pocket park development takes various forms, with a growing number of articles published each year. However, research on this topic is primarily concentrated in the United States and China, with significant knowledge gaps remaining globally. (b) The utilization of pocket parks is affected by various factors, including internal, external physical, and socio-economic factors. The mechanisms of these factors and their interactions demand deeper understanding. (c) There is a need to conduct an in-depth exploration of planning methods for pocket parks, and planning and design methods in different country contexts can be expanded and compared. (d) Further research is needed to compare the benefits of pocket parks in different climatic zones in terms of depth and width. The outcome of this study can contribute to the body of knowledge on pocket parks, foster their wider acceptance, and help urban planners, practitioners, policy makers, and government managers apply them more effectively in resilient and livable cities of the future.",Environmental Research Letters,2023.0,22,"{'url': 'https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ace7e2/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1748-9326/ace7e2?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ace7e2, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Reuse permitted under CC BYNC. No commercial reuse. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ. BACKGROUND Plastic pollution is a global crisis of increasing scale and severity. From the extraction of raw materials for production to the ultimate disposal of massive waste, plastics impact negatively several environmental domains, animal health and potentially human health, with possible global health and social implications. These effects of plastics are poised to increase with the rate of pollution. The annual rate of mismanaged endoflife plastic entering terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems will respectively reach 11 million tons and 18 million tons per year in 2040, more than double those of 2016. These threats are being recognised and challenged through global agreements spearheaded by the United Nations (UN) and other international bodies to prevent, reduce and control plastic pollution. Individual nations are also taking action, with bans in over 120 countries on selected singleuse plastics. Despite concrete and coordinated preventive and mitigation measures, growing plastic production, overreliance on singleuse plastics, ineffective waste management, and slow decomposition are leading to a significant worsening of pollution and associated impacts. 7 Pollution—‘unwanted waste released to air, water and land by human activity’—is increasingly recognised as a threat to human health, yet the growing burden of plastic pollution specifically does not appear to be a priority on the agenda of the global public health community [Global health is defined as ‘an area for study, research, and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide. Global health emphasises transnational health issues, determinants and solutions; involves many disciplines within and beyond the health sciences and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration; and is a synthesis of populationbased prevention with individuallevel clinical care’.]. Guided by a mission to promote health and reduce health inequities within human populations, the global health community is encouraged to take a multisectoral view and join the movement combatting the plastic pollution crisis. 13 The aim of this paper is to raise global health professionals’ awareness of the problem posed by plastic pollution and to propose what can be done in response. We begin by making the case that plastic pollution is a One Health problem because of interconnected impacts on environmental, animal and human health.

7183010ceec7e681225f9224ef7f47e12269b8ff,Enhancing the Shelf Life of Palak and Coriander through Modified Atmosphere Packaging under Diverse Storage Environments,"Aim: Green leafy vegetables are renowned for their rich vitamin and mineral content as well as their nutritional value. However, these vegetables are highly perishable due to their accelerated rates of respiration and transpiration. The process of packing and the choice of packaging materials play a crucial role in extending their shelf life. The main aim of this study was to prolong the shelf life of two prominent leafy greens, Palak (Beta vulgaris L. var. bengalensis) and Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), using Modified Atmospheric Packaging (MAP) and various packaging materials.
Study Design: The study employed an FCRD experimental design with 12 treatments and 3 replications.
Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted at Department of Vegetable Science, HC&RI, TNAU, Coimbatore during the year 2023.
Methodology: Freshly harvested Palak and Coriander were collected, sorted, and prepared as 250-gram samples. Two packaging materials (LDPE and PP) and three gas compositions (G1, G2, G3) was employed. The vegetables were stored under both ambient (35±5°C) and refrigerated (5°C) conditions and their physiological loss in weight (PLW %) was monitored. The observations were taken every day up to the spoilage of the produce.
Results: According to the research findings, vegetables could remain fresh under ambient storage for up to 4 days and under refrigeration for up to 15 days. In ambient storage conditions, Palak exhibited the longest shelf life in treatment T3 - G3M1 (4% O2, 5% CO2, LDPE), followed by T5 - G2M2 (6% O2, 5% CO2, PP). Meanwhile, Coriander showed better shelf life in treatment T2 - G2M1 (6% O2, 5% CO2, LDPE), followed by T6 - G3M2 (4% O2, 5% CO2, PP). Under refrigerated storage conditions, Palak exhibited an extended shelf life in treatment T9 - G3M1 (4% O2, 5% CO2, LDPE), followed by T12 - G3M2 (4% O2, 5% CO2, PP). For Coriander, the best results were achieved with treatment T12 - G3M2 (4% O2, 5% CO2, PP), followed by T8 - G2M1 (6% O2, 5% CO2, LDPE).
Conclusion: Proper packaging and gas composition significantly increased the shelf life of these leafy greens, offering potential benefits for both producers and consumers. Palak had a longer shelf life when stored under refrigerated conditions, up to 14 days, while Coriander could be kept fresh for up to 12 days in the refrigerator. Gas composition G3 (4% O2, 5% CO2) was found to be effective and LDPE was generally the preferred packaging material in extending the shelf life of the vegetables.",International Journal of Environment and Climate Change,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://journalijecc.com/index.php/IJECC/article/view/2932/5772', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.9734/ijecc/2023/v13i102932?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.9734/ijecc/2023/v13i102932, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

261204ef3bd3242cc9a5918f72e8b3ec61e5ed6d,The Archimedean Revolution of Nicolaus Copernicus,"The year 2023 marks the 550th anniversary of the birth of the Polish scholar Nicolaus Copernicus. Usually deemed one of the most emblematic examples of the scientific revolution and the theory of paradigm shift in the history of science, the heliocentric theory proposed by Copernicus in 1543 has fed the minds of philosophers and historians for centuries. Recently, increasing attention has been put on the recognition of the sources that might have influenced Copernicus’s creativity. The outcomes showed that the claims on paradigm shift are pretty shaky, because Copernicus was deliberately in dialogue with Ancient Greek and Arabic authors, and his On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres deliberately emulates Ptolemy’s Almagest. In this sense, the essence of the scientific revolution is more an attempt to recreate the debate with ancient authors then a breaking with their paradigms. This study takes a closer examination of Copernicus’s early draft on heliocentrism, the Commentariolus (1510-1515 ca.) and it argues that the birth of the heliocentric theory was first conceived as an attempt to write an Archimedes-like treatise, while the efforts to emulate Ptolemy come at a later stage. On this account, the early Copernicus can be considered an Archimedean.",Transversal: International Journal for the Historiography of Science,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://periodicos.ufmg.br/index.php/transversal/article/download/46703/37956', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.24117/2526-2270.2022.i14.09?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.24117/2526-2270.2022.i14.09, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a0056dc0b9bb45415755d56cebe0518839185cc7,"Much new research, and advances for the IQ","Welcome to this special double issue of IASSIST Quarterly for the year 2023, IQ vol. 47(3-4).  
We are delighted to close out the year by offering the second special issue of the IASSIST Quarterly to showcase articles from the Africa workshop. Articles in this issue were presented in the second Africa Workshop which was held in Ibadan, Nigeria, in October 2022.  Guest editors Winny Nekesa and Robert Burosta have again expertly steered the editorial process to bring us this research.  
While their Guest Editors’ Notes describe the included articles, we would like to use this space to share a number of announcements about administrative work on the journal.  First, please join us in welcoming four new Editorial Board members for a four-year term:  
  Robert Stalone Buwule, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Uganda 
  Winny Nekesa, National Social Security Fund, Uganda 
  Deborah Wiltshire, GESIS, Germany, and 
  Ryan Womack, Rutgers University, United States 
With these appointments, we achieve two goals.  First, we stagger the terms of service of Board members so that only half will roll off the Board at any one time, ensuring continuity of knowledge moving forward.  Second, we better diversify geographic representation on the Board to reflect IASSIST’s international membership.  Winny and Robert bring experience as IQ guest editors to the Board.  Deborah and Ryan bring perspective from the IASSIST Administrative Committee. 
Over the coming year, IQ editorial staff and Board members will be exploring a variety of changes to the journal, many of which were proposed by you, the membership.  We’ll keep you informed as we make decisions on various of those suggestions.  Several advances that we have already accomplished are to behind-the-scenes processes but may directly benefit authors who publish with us as well you, our readers.  
Working retrospectively to the last issue, 47(2), as well as for all issues going forward, the editorial staff have published the reference lists of all articles as metadata.  This complies with I4OC, a standard that asks for citations to be structured, separable, shareable, and freely accessible (to both human and automated harvesting), resulting in citations that are index-able and searchable.  Citation-tracking services like Crossref also require this.  The end result is that people searching for any of the sources listed in our articles will find our articles, which over time may result in greater research impact for our authors.  Reference linking will also expose articles to new tools, such as OpenAlex, an open citation metrics tool that can help measure impact.  We thank our managing editor, Phillip Ndhlovu, for his effort in effecting this change. 
The second change was made by the Library Open Publishing and Open Education staff at the University of Alberta, whose work supports the Open Journal System platform on which the journal is hosted.  Their efforts not only keep journal production flowing smoothly, they work continually to improve the technical systems to uphold and improve open access to our content.  In this case, they have implemented a Research Organization Registry (ROR) feature to allow authors to select their organizational affiliations from the list of organizations in ROR.  This will not only speed the information input authors must complete during submission, but also standardize it to be represented consistently within the journal, and make it clear and accurate for sharing in external systems such as DOAJ and CrossRef. 
Finally, we want to mention a new content feature premiering in this issue. Following the receipt of a Letter to the Editor (to our knowledge the first ever), we’ve added a new section to the journal’s infrastructure to accommodate such conversations. We hope you will enjoy reading this commentary which extends the implications of the Hertzog, et al. article in 47(2) to a different type of personally identifiable data, DNA.  We invite you to take advantage of the option to use this feature in future to correspond with our articles.   
We wish you all the best for whichever end-of-year holidays you celebrate!  We look forward to showcasing your work through the IQ in the coming new year, both in the research you submit for publication and in implementing your ideas for evolving the journal’s content and production.

Students are agents of change for society in a better direction. Community Service Program (KKN) is a form of community service as a form of research in the field of science and technology to improve human resources in society. Group 27 Thematic Real Work Lecture (KKNT) Muhammadiyah University Purworejo for the 2022/2023 academic year was held in Bedono Kluwung Village, Kemiri District, Purworejo Regency. The KKNT activities were carried out from 5 January 2023 – 2 February 2023. Prior to the implementation of the KKNT, observations were made to determine the condition of the location. Observations were carried out using the following methods: (1) question and answer, (2) documentation, and (3) looking directly at the field. Knowing the potential and conditions in Bedono Kluwung Village, UMP KKN students organize work programs that can help and support the progress of Bedono Kluwung Village. The work programs are the Juvenile Delinquency Education Seminar at SMA Negeri 4 Purworejo, Public Health, namely Parenting, and UMKM in the village of Bedono Kluwung. In carrying out these programs, of course, we really need help from the people of Bedono Kluwung village. After we made observations, it turned out that many people already had small home-based businesses. Among them there is making salted eggs, making rengginang from cassava, making herbal medicine from spices, making birthday cakes and puddings and many others. In accordance with the theme of this year's KKNT ""Economic Improvement Through Technology Transformation"" our group wants to help introduce these products through social media in an even more interesting way, because on average they sell their products in traditional markets, even though there are one or two who have used this method. The form of the work program from our group is making interesting pamphlets for MSME actors in the village of Bedono Kluwung, Kemiri, Purworejo.

ff3710990279bf573178a4ebfd494b1f4b731da7,The 100 most cited articles in malignant hyperthermia,"Bibliometric analysis is a widely used method to identify and evaluate the trends and characteristics of the scientific publications in a specific research field. A large volume of literature has been published in the field of malignant hyperthermia (MH). However, no bibliometric studies have been conducted to describe the characteristics of highly cited articles on MH. Therefore, this study aims to identify the 100 most frequently cited articles about malignant hyperthermia, describe their characteristics, and investigate research trends. Searches were performed in Web of Science Core Collection, Google Scholar, and Scopus from January 1900 to March 2023, with no language limitation. The 100 most frequently cited articles were selected and analyzed. Characteristics including publication year, journal, impact factor, authors, authors countries, citation number, journal citation indicator, study design, and topics were analyzed. For the 100 most cited articles, the number of times each article was cited ranged from 84 to 1254, with a median of 133. The number of articles published peaked in the decade of 1990s (n = 30). The articles were published in 39 journals, with Anesthesiology leading with 13 publications and then the British Journal of Anaesthesia with 12 publications. The authors were from 21 countries, led by the United States (n = 37). Forty articles focused on genetic susceptibility screening, 27 articles were about MH etiology, and 11 articles were about diagnosis and treatment. The mortality rate of MH and dantrolene availability are known to be uneven worldwide. This may partly be explained by the fact that scientific publications primarily report by authors from developed countries.

We recommend a visit to the webpage of Sancta Lucia Gilles for a fantastic compilation of the history of optometry in Sweden — https://www.sanctaluciagille.se/optikeryrkets-historia. In this editorial we share some exciting news about the optometry education and extended responsibilities for optometrists. After about 20 years of solid first-cycle bachelor education, Linnaeus University opened a new master program in optometry and vision sciences in 2021 (Linnaeus University, 2022). From September 2023 the bachelor education at Linnaeus University will be available from Campus Kalmar and Campus Gothenburg. Thatmeans an annual intake of about 75 first-cycle students and up to 25 second-cycle (masters) students per year. With an annual intake of 100 new students Linnaeus University will be a big player in optometry in theNordic countries. In parallel, the responsibilities of Swedish optometrists are expected to be extended by the Swedish authorities. We aim to shed some light on the impact of these developments on optometry education in Sweden and the rest of the Nordic countries. Recognising the evolving healthcare landscape and, probably, appreciating optometrists as a major asset for the chain of eye care, Socialstyrelsen (the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare) is planning to extend optometrists responsibilities. Socialstyrelsen is an agency under the Swedish Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Socialstyrelsen, 2019; 2020) and is responsible for ensuring the quality, accessibility, and equity of healthcare and social services. From January 2024 the main planned changes to the law that controls optometric practice are: (a) optometrists will be allowed to perform eye exams and prescribe refractive correction to children of any age (currently Swedish optometrists cannot prescribe to children under the age of 8 years), (b) the text “optometrists cannot touch the eye” will be removed from the law, and (c) the “contact lens license” will cease to exist as a speciality, that is, all optometrists will be licensed to work with contact lenses. In addition, despite it not being mentioned in the law, the current consensus amongst all eye care professionals is that optometrists must be more selective when referring patients to hospital care. In many cases, optometrists can follow up their patients themselves instead of referring them to hospital. This seems particularly relevant for conditions such as non-exudative age-relatedmacular degeneration and glaucoma (Landgren & Peters, 2021). The law will also include some updates about the vision assessment for driving licenses, but that has less impact on the scope of practice.",Scandinavian Journal of Optometry and Visual Science,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://open.lnu.se/index.php/sjovs/article/download/3989/3439', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15626/sjovs.v16i1.3989?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15626/sjovs.v16i1.3989, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The study aimed to determine the effectiveness of using PhET simulations with inquiry learning models to increase students' conceptual understanding of static electricity. This type of research was quasi-experimental with a posttest-only control group design. The subjects were students of class IX at Public Junior High School (SMPN) 1 Tebing Tinggi for the 2022/2023 academic year. Data collection used concept comprehension question sheets that had been prepared by indicators of conceptual understanding and indicators of competency in static electricity material. The study showed the average value of the indicator in the experimental group was higher than the control group.

3cdd82c14a491ae7bddf0dc8148911ea8f226a9d,The association between fear of missing out and mobile phone addiction: a meta-analysis,"Background Numerous studies have explored the association between fear of missing out and mobile phone addiction, but there are different viewpoints and the results are inconsistent. This study intends to estimate the strength of the correlation between fear of missing out and mobile phone addiction in general through a meta-analysis, and to analyze the influencing factors of the inconsistent results of previous studies. Methods We Searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Wan fang Database, CQVIP Journal Database、Web of Science Core Collection, Elsevier SD, Springer Online Journals, Medline, EBSCO-ERIC, SAGE Online Journals, PsycINFO, PsycArticles and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses。85 studies (90 independent effect size) were included from 2016 to 2023。The pooled correlation coefficient of the association between fear of missing out and mobile phone addiction was calculated by a random effects model using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis(Version 3.3). Results The main effect analysis revealed a high positive correlation between fear of missing out and mobile phone addiction ( r  = 0.47, 95%CI [0.44, 0.50]). Furthermore, the measurements of mobile phone addiction moderated the strength of the association between fear of missing out and mobile phone addiction, with the highest correlation measured using MPATS and the lowest correlation measured using MPDQ. The age, gender, year of publication, cultural background, and the measurements of fear of missing out had no significant effect on the correlation between fear of missing out and mobile phone addiction. Conclusion The results indicated that fear of missing out was closely related to mobile phone addiction, which complied with the I-PACE model.

VR applications based on instrumental activities of daily living (iADL-VR) could offer a promising approach with greater ecological validity for intervention in groups with cognitive impairments. However, the effectiveness of this approach is still debated. Objective This systematic review aims to synthesize the effects of iADL-VR interventions to rehabilitate, train, or stimulate cognitive functions in healthy adults and people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and different types of dementia. Methods A systematic search was performed in the Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and APA PsycNet databases until September 2022 and repeated in April 2023. The selected studies met the search terms, were peer-reviewed, included an iADL-VR intervention, and were written in English. Descriptive, qualitative studies, reviews, cognitive assessment, non-intervention studies, those unrelated to VR or iADL, those focused on motor aspects, and non-degenerative disorders were excluded. The PEDro scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the controlled studies. To present and synthesize the results, we organized the extracted data into three tables, including PEDro scores, participant characteristics, and study characteristics. Results Nineteen studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. The total sample reached 590 participants, mostly women (72.67%). Approximately 30% were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, and 20% had mild cognitive impairment. Variables such as authors and year of publication, study design, type of intervention and VR applied, duration of the intervention, main findings, and conclusions were extracted. Regarding demographic characteristics, the sample size, age, sex, years of education, neurological diagnosis, dropouts, and the city and country where the intervention took place were recorded. Almost all studies showed improvements in some or all the outcomes after the intervention, generally greater in the iADL-VR group than in the control group. Conclusion iADL-VR interventions could be beneficial in improving the performance of cognitive functions in older adults and people with MCI and different types of dementia. The ecological component of these tasks makes them very suitable for transferring what has been learned to the real world. However, such transfer needs to be confirmed by further studies with larger and more homogeneous samples and longer follow-up periods.

0cd55887110d1323d8f5f1b31e386bcd8681eeb7,The Art of Prediction,"Predictions have always attracted interest, because seeing the future could be very useful, powerful, and also fun. Those who can predict ahead of others have a strategic advantage. Predictions are essential in business, the military [1], and healthcare. As of recently, with COVID and with recent wars, predictions became critical to humankind's survival: for predicting when to open or close countries, predicting supply chains, vaccines, etc. Predictions are hard because they depend on many factors. There is a social aspect to making any prediction that pertains to humans hard. There is an ecological aspect that is extremely complex on its own. Technology predictions may be simplest, but technology also depends on business success, i.e. economics. For these reasons, technology predictions are a combination of art, science, and business. Teams in the IEEE Computer Society and Future Directions, led by the author of this paper, have conducted technology predictions for more than a decade. We predicted technologies for the following year, eight years out, we predicted individual technologies and megatrends comprising a multitude of technologies. We evaluated our predictions to gain insights into how successful we were and to improve our processes. Our predictions have gained a lot of interest in the community, resulting in regular press releases growing in target audiences. The most recent one has a target audience larger than 200M. We started special issues of IEEE Computer on Technology Predictions (the 4th one will appear in July 2023) and a quarterly column on Predictions in the same magazine (the 8th column will also appear in July 2023). We have regularly organized panels and given keynotes on technology predictions.

New methodologies and systems have been developed to analyze scientific production and performance indicators from large quantities of data available from the scientific databases, such as Web of Science or Scopus. In this paper, we analyzed the international scientific production and co-authorship patterns for the most productive authors from Serbia based on the obtained Web of Science dataset in the period 2006–2013. We performed bibliometric and scientometric analyses together with statistical and collaboration network analysis, to reveal the causes of extraordinary publishing performance of some authors. For such authors, we found significant inequality in distribution of papers over journals and countries of co-authors, using Gini coefficient and Lorenz curves. Most of the papers belong to multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and the field of applied sciences. We have discovered three specific collaboration patterns that lead to high productivity in international collaboration. First pattern corresponds to mega-authorship papers with hundreds of co-authors gathered in specific research groups. The other two collaboration patterns were found in mathematics and multidisciplinary science, mainly application of graph theory and computational methods in physical chemistry. The former pattern results in a star-shaped collaboration network with mostly individual collaborators. The latter pattern includes multiple actors with high betweenness centrality measure and identified brokerage roles. The results are compared with the later period 2014–2023, where high scientific production has been observed in some other fields, such as biology and food science and technology.",Journal of Big Data,2023.0,8,"{'url': 'https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40537-023-00744-1', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10184642, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

She was a professor of botany at Cairo University who authored a distinctive flora book, Flora of Egypt . She also wrote a series of popular science works on the plants and the history of Egypt. This grand old woman had been closely associated with the Cairo University for over 50 years, some 32 years as a professor of botany in the Herbarium. She was recognized and respected not only as the 'dean of Egyptian botany', but appreciated by all the researchers who knew her as one of those rare scientist-scholars who is completely selfless. She helped countless students and investigators both in Egypt and abroad by giving freely of her vast experience and deep knowledge on all matters Egyptian, motivated only by a sincere hope that a more carefully planned research project could be launched, or if a project was near completion, that a more mature complete interpretation could be achieved. With the passing of Vivi Laurent-Täckholm, who died in Stockholm on 3 May 1978, at the age of 80, biological sciences in general and Egyptian botanical science in particular, have suffered a great loss.

Methods: A 10-item survey was emailed to domestic KSGE members between May 1 and May 15, 2023. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: In total, 216 complete responses were analyzed. Most respondents (46.8%) read CE once or twice monthly. The proportion of respondents who read the journal once or twice a year or did not read it at all was quite high, at 36.6%. The most informative article type was review articles (53%), and the least-read type was editorials (33%). Ninety-nine respondents (45.8%) stated that they did not want to submit their articles to CE because CE is not a Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) journal (38.4%). Eighty-nine respondents (41.2%) did not cite CE articles in their manuscripts. Furthermore, 41.2% of the respondents declined review invitations because they were too busy (73.0%). The two most common requests for CE were to increase the number of guidelines and review articles (38.0%) and to improve the journal quality (34.7%). Conclusion: Although CE is a representative journal of KSGE, the level of interest and concern for CE among society members was relatively low. Nonetheless, this survey offers valuable insights into the needs and current status of CE, paving the way for its further development.

The program is situated in the Faculty of Engineering and welcomed its first student cohort in the Fall of 2023. The program is designed for students who have a diverse set of interests, and who are passionate about combining technology with other fields, including social science, business, or arts, rather than those wanting to be engineers. The flexible program provides students with the skills required for modern multidisciplinary job markets, and with the opportunity to define and pursue their own career trajectory. As this type of flexibility and openness may seem daunting for first year students, sample learning paths were created based on current job market trends, with more learning paths in development. To support using these paths and developing new ones, a tool was developed to help students plan their path and select their courses. This paper focuses on the development of this unique program in the Canadian context, as well as the challenges associated with its development.

8d3b30d7cefd7d67a630adbd92c1fbfb6e31dab9,Effect of Oxalic Acid on Control of Post-harvest Browning of Litchi (Litchi chinensis L.),"Post-harvest browning of litchi is a common phenomenon that occurs due to enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. Enzymatic browning is primarily caused by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, leading to the formation of brown pigments. Non-enzymatic browning is caused by the Maillard reaction between reducing sugars and amino acids. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and mechanical damage can accelerate browning. Proper handling, storage, and the use of antioxidants can help minimize post-harvest browning, extending the shelf life and maintaining the visual appeal of litchi fruits. The present investigation was laid out in the post-harvest laboratory of horticulture department, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj during the year 2022-2023. The experiment was laid out in the CRBD with 8 treatments and 3 replications. Litchi fruit, Cv.

9a4a34af6c5586537e8a4fbedeb2110aadc4c047,EXAMINATION OF PARENTS' FAMILY NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ATTITUDES IN TERMS OF VARIOUS DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES (ELAZIĞ EXAMPLE),"Individuals who do not have balanced nutrition during childhood encounter the problem of obesity. The most important environmental risk factors in the emergence of obesity are: changing dietary habits, increased screen time spent with technological devices such as computers, tablets, phones, and televisions, adopting a sedentary lifestyle as a result, and a decrease in physical activity. In addition, factors such as increased academic stress on children, socio-economic level, and residing in major cities are also risk factors. In line with this information, the purpose of our research is to examine the relationship between parents' family nutrition and physical activity attitudes and the eating behaviors of high school students. First, the universe was determined in our study, followed by the use of the general survey model from quantitative research methods. Parents of 375 high school students studying in the 2022-2023 academic year participated in the research. The relationships between the variables in our research were analyzed statistically. The ""Family Nutrition and Physical Activity Screening Scale"" (Özdemir, 2020) was used to collect data. Our application form consists of two sections. The first section contains the demographic information form containing the data to be collected from the participants. The second section contains the scale form to be used in the research. The scale consists of five sub-dimensions: physical activity, parental behaviors, unhealthy eating habits, healthy food intake, and sedentary behaviors, restriction/reward sub-dimensions. SPSS 21 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) was used in the study. First, the analysis of descriptive statistical data of the participant group was performed. Then, the internal consistency coefficient was calculated. After that, t-tests and ANOVA tests were conducted to analyze the differentiation of scale results. Under the Post-Hoc heading, the Tukey test was performed for scale scores showing homogeneous distribution, and the direction of differentiation was determined. In the research, when the average values of the groups were examined, it was observed that the family nutrition and physical activity attitudes of males were higher than those of females. There was no significant differentiation for variables such as age, class, monthly income status, school type, success status, and parental education status. When the variable data on breakfast habits were examined, it was found that the participants who answered ""I have breakfast at home"" significantly differed from those who answered ""I have breakfast at school"" and ""I do not have breakfast.""",SOCIAL SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31567/ssd.1060?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31567/ssd.1060, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study was conducted in Notre Dame of Midsayap College, Midsayap, Cotabato, Philippines during the second semester of academic year 2022-2023. It included as respondents thirty-two purposively selected honor students at the College of Arts and Sciences. They were 21 to 28 years old, majority of whom were females, and mostly graduating students. Either their father, mother, brother or sister or both raise and take care of their family. Findings revealed that the respondents had experienced high level of parental pressure with respect to expectations, rewards and penalty, support and encouragement, and setting rules and standards; while they experienced moderate level of parental pressure with respect to monitoring, and comparison. Moreover, they strongly agreed that the acts or practices of their parents of explaining to them the importance of sacrifices to earn a career, of reminding them of their studies as preparation for their future work, and of expressing joy when they perform well in their studies had put pressure in them to do well in their study. A few of the respondents had accomplished excellent academic performance although most of them had accomplished good academic performance. There is a weak and negative relationship between parental pressure and academic performance, implying either that too much parental pressure could cause negative effect on the academic performance of their children, or that the very low academic performance of children could prompt parents to put more parental pressure over them.

The Cochran’s Q-test and I 2 statistics were applied to assess heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR), standardized mean difference (SMD), and mean difference for different outcomes, and a meta-regression method was utilized to investigate the factors affecting heterogeneity between studies. A total of 14 studies were included in the analysis, and the outcomes investigated were: change in gene expression, oxidant parameters, antioxidant parameters, and DNA damage parameters in the umbilical cord blood of the fetus and fetal developmental disorders, cancers, and childhood development disorders. Totally, the events of fetal and childhood abnormalities were more common in parents who have been exposed to EMFs compared to those who have not (SMD and 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 [0.15–0.35]; I 2, 91%). Moreover, fetal developmental disorders (OR, 1.34; CI, 1.17–1.52; I 2, 0%); cancer (OR, 1.14; CI, 1.05–1.23; I 2, 60.1%); childhood development disorders (OR, 2.10; CI, 1.00–3.21; I 2, 0%); changes in gene expression (mean difference [MD], 1.02; CI, 0.67–1.37; I 2, 93%); oxidant parameters (MD, 0.94; CI, 0.70–1.18; I 2, 61.3%); and DNA damage parameters (MD, 1.01; CI, 0.17–1.86; I 2, 91.6%) in parents who have been exposed to EMFs were more than those in parents who have not. According to meta-regression, publication year has a significant effect on heterogeneity (coefficient: 0.033; 0.009–0.057). Maternal exposure to electromagnetic fields, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy, due to the high level of stem cells and their high sensitivity to this radiation, the biochemical parameters of the umbilical cord blood examined was shown increased oxidative stress reactions, changes in protein gene expression, DNA damage, and increased embryonic abnormalities. In addition, parental exposure to ionizing and non-ionizing radiation can lead to the enhancement of different cell-based cancers and developmental disorders such as speech problems in childhood.",Open Medicine,2023.0,12,"{'url': 'https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/med-2023-0697/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10183723, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, its effect on cancer-free and overall survival is questioned. Therefore, we aimed to determine the potential benefits of the technique by performing a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of the available evidence. Methods Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, and Embase were searched on February 22, 2023. Original studies on short- and long-term oncological outcomes of adult patients undergoing right hemicolectomy with complete mesocolic excision as a treatment for primary colon cancer were considered for inclusion. Outcomes were extracted and pooled using a model with random effects. Results A total of 586 publications were identified through database searching, and 18 from citation searching. Exclusion of 552 articles left 24 articles for inclusion. Meta-analysis showed that complete mesocolic excision increased the lymph node harvest (5 studies, 1479 patients, MD 9.62, 95% CI 5.83–13.41, p  > 0.0001, I ^2 84%), 5-year overall survival (5 studies, 2381 patients, OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.14–3.09, p  = 0.01, I ^2 66%), 5-year disease-free survival (4 studies, 1376 patients, OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.51–3.23, p  < 0.0001, I ^2 0%) and decreased the incidence of local recurrence (4 studies, 818 patients, OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09–0.79, p  = 0.02, I ^2 0%) when compared to standard right hemicolectomy. Perioperative morbidity was similar between the techniques (8 studies, 3899 patients, OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89–1.22, p  = 0.97, I ^2 0%). Conclusion Meta-analysis of observational and randomised studies showed that right hemicolectomy with complete mesocolic excision for primary right colon cancer improves oncologic results without increasing morbidity/mortality.

The growth of malignant neoplasms of the female reproductive system in recent years has acquired a tendency to ""rejuvenation"" – more frequent appearance in women of reproductive age. Radical methods of treating pathologies of the oncogynecological spectrum leave severe consequences in the form of genitourinary syndrome, disorders of endocrine-metabolic processes, sexual function, unstable psychological state, social maladaptation and a decrease in the quality of life. To restore the effects of antitumor treatment, a comprehensive rehabilitation is required, developed by a multidisciplinary team of specialists, including questionnaires on the quality of life. Numerous studies have shown the effectiveness of questionnaires FACT-G, FACT-En, EORTC, FSFI, HADS, the health, activity, mood questionnaire, modified Kupperman–Uvarova menopausal index, MDQ, magnesium deficiency assessment test, stress tolerance self-assessment test. These questionnaires allow us to assess the patient's condition in a timely manner, his perception of his own quality of life and the presence of comorbid diseases and conditions. The introduction of questionnaires into routine clinical practice will make it possible to more effectively carry out rehabilitation measures in oncogynecological patients.",Vrach,2023.0,4,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.29296/25877305-2023-01-02?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.29296/25877305-2023-01-02, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

edf328caadb7cacc3e681bfa0f2aa28c2efd7f8b,Transition to remote/hybrid learning during the COVID-19 pandemic among Saudi students of the College of Applied Medical Sciences: a cross-sectional study,"Background The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented unparalleled and unique stressors and challenges to the field of applied health sciences education. This study explored how the College of Applied Medical Sciences (COAMS) Saudi students perceive the transition to remote/ hybrid learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional exploratory investigation was carried out during the months of February and March in the year 2023 among 196- COAMS Saudi students, using the 48-item previously developed and validated questionnaire, and with a non-probability convenient sampling technique. Descriptive statistics were generated for participants’ demographics, and for each questionnaire item and statistical analysis was performed using chi-square test. Results Out of the 283 undergraduates who have enrolled in COAMS, a total of 196 students have agreed to participate in the study with an overall response rate of 69.3%. Over 70% of COAMS students were satisfied and engaged in their on-site coursework. Nevertheless, questionnaire data indicates that their satisfaction and level of engagement diminished following the shift to remote learning. More than 62% of COAMS students were satisfied with their instructors’ instructional and assessment strategies during on-site coursework, but such perceptions have decreased with remote instruction. Hybrid learning can be beneficial and effective in improving the performance and learning experience of COAMS students. As compared to female students, COAMS male students were more satisfied with remote learning because it met their needs (p = 0.017). Conclusion Remote classrooms have lower attendance and interest than on-site classes. Despite lower satisfaction levels in online courses, hybrid learning was viewed favourably by COAMS students. Higher educational institutions should develop plans to increase student involvement, improve academic integrity, and assess the effect of the pandemic on undergraduate education on a regular basis. By incorporating these measures, educational institutions can enhance and support the remote learning experience for their students.",Frontiers in Medicine,2023.0,9,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2023.1257589/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10477598, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f2aa7b2c218fead355895a96b17823b17fae0e8a,A Strategic View of a Fashion Design Programme: What Can We Do Better?,"This paper is based on a review of Walter Sisulu University documents and the researcher’s five-year lecturing experience in the WSU Department of Fashion’s Fashion Design Programme (FDP). The paper was inspired by the department’s inability to plan, implement, and oversee operational strategies to meet the FDP’s missions and vision statements, which negatively impacted the programme’s portability and cost. I found that academic staff were unable to further their qualifications or produce research despite being given eight hours per week to spend on research or qualification development. The WSU FDP also overspends the money in the students‘ materials accounts. The FDP has too many subjects, negatively affecting its graduation rates since 2008. I further found that the introduction of computer-aided design as a teaching and learning strategy would cut Creative Design II & III and Technical Drawing II & III expenditure by R175 022 compared to the 2015 costs. The FDP bought machinery in 2009 that was costly for the university and yet remains unused due to space and power limitations. The FDP could financially contribute more meaningfully to WSU’s stability and viability if the FDP were offered a spacious building and could develop and implement an extended programme. I conclude this paper by making recommendations for how WSU can improve the FDP, meet the FDP’s mission and vision statements, and strengthen its viability.

The use of community or family health care to control diabetes will be hindered by problems such as lack of resources. The Internet+ model, especially telemedicine, has the potential to improve treatment compliance and blood sugar control. More research is required to assess the effects of pharmaceutical services within this framework on the management of diabetes. Methods Computer search of CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed, VIP Database, Web of Science, Embase (To Augest 2023). It compared telemedicine with routine care of diabetes. The main results included in the study were reported HbA1C at three time points and three different intervention. Result Out of 470 citations, 12 eligible RCT were identified (n=1558). All remote medical studies achieved a significant reduction in HbA1C during the follow-up period, but it varied with intervention time and measures. Conclusion Compared with routine care, it was found that with remote medical intervention, the patients HbA1C were significantly improved. Compared to telephone intervention and intelligent devices, pharmaceutical services based on the Internet model have shown better results. In addition, the study also found that the efficacy of this intervention continuously improves over time in the short term. However, if the intervention time exceeds 1 year, the efficacy will gradually decrease.",Theoretical and Natural Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.54254/2753-8818/16/20240607?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.54254/2753-8818/16/20240607, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As a bladder-preservation option recommended in guidelines, trimodal therapy (TMT) has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, it is still uncertain whether TMT can provide comparable oncologic outcomes to RC. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether TMT yields comparable outcomes to RC. Methods We conducted a systematic search of Web of Science, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases up to June 2023 to identify studies that met our inclusion criteria. The primary outcome measures evaluated in this study were overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). The study quality was evaluated independently by two authors, and data were extracted accordingly. Results After excluding duplicates and ineligible articles, our meta-analysis included seven studies involving 3,489 and 13,877 patients in the TMT and RC groups, respectively. Short-term overall survival rates were comparable between the groups, but beyond 5 and > 10-years, the RC group had significantly higher overall survival rates compared to the TMT group. In terms of cancer-specific survival, there was no significant difference between the groups at 1-year follow-up, but from the second year onwards, including the 5-year and > 10-year nodes, the RC group had significantly better outcomes compared to the TMT group. Conclusion The treatment effect of RC is better than that of TMT. Unless the patient can’t tolerate RC or has a strong desire to preserve the bladder, RC should be chosen over TMT in treatment, and patients undergoing TMT should be closely followed up.",World Journal of Surgical Oncology,2023.0,11,"{'url': 'https://wjso.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12957-023-03161-z', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10464249, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Therefore, this study investigated the association between SB and the risk of cognitive decline (CD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the elderly. Methods A comprehensive search was independently conducted by two researchers (XC and GQ) in seven electronic databases, including Medline (via PubMed), China Biology Medicine, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, and VIP database for Chinese technical periodicals, covering studies published from the inception of database to June 2023. Studies that investigated the relationship between SB and the risk of CD or MCI in the elderly were included. The quality of the literature was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) assessment tools. The combined effect size analysis, subgroup analysis, and publication bias assessment were performed using STATA 14.0. Results A total of 13 cross-sectional and 6 cohort studies involving 81,791 individuals were included, comprising 17 high-quality studies and 2 medium-quality studies. We found that SB was significantly associated with an increased risk of CD [odds ratio (OR) = 1.69, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.47–1.94] or MCI (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.14–1.56) among the elderly. Subgroup analysis stratified according to comorbidity, lifestyle, family structure, publication year, and region showed statistical differences between groups, and the consistency of the results revealed the sources of the heterogeneity. Conclusion This meta-analysis showed that SB is positively associated with the risk of CD or MCI in the elderly, providing a higher level of evidence for the promotion of healthy behaviors by clinicians and health policymakers.

eef7a7bdc6601f7043bc9e5de17c6bb746ef058a,Brill and Open Access,"An online conversation with two representatives of Brill, a publisher that is particularly strong in the Humanities and Social Sciences. A 340-year-old publishing house, Brill still primarily sells books and journals in a traditional manner, i.e. as hardcopies and online fulltexts behind a paywall. Currently, Brill has a total output of around 1,400 academic books per year. Just over 10% of these titles are published in Open Access thanks to authors (or their institutions) paying a Book Processing Charge (BPC). Among its 300+ peer-reviewed journals, approx. 10% are published according to the Diamond Open Access model, meaning that some sort of sponsorship allows Brill to offer its services with no author- or reader-facing charges. In the discussion, Open Research Officer Stephanie Veldman explains the economic mechanisms and strategic thinking behind Brill’s work in the field of open access. Publishing director for History, Social Sciences and Biology Arjan van Dijk highlights the author’s and editor’s perspectives, using the successful Journal of Jesuit Studies (launched in 2013) as a concrete example. Both Veldman and van Dijk see it as an important part of their mission to increase the proportion of books and journals that are published in open access.

7176d81d9033dada220a0d59af3d9d7767654b25,Identification of traits underpinning good breadmaking performance of wheat grown with reduced nitrogen fertilisation,"Abstract Background Nitrogen fertiliser is the major input and cost for wheat production, being required to support the development of the canopy to maximise yield and for the synthesis of the gluten proteins that are necessary for breadmaking. Consequently, current high‐yielding cultivars require the use of nitrogen fertilisation levels above the yield optimum to achieve the grain protein content needed for breadmaking. This study aimed to reduce this requirement by identifying traits that allow the use of lower levels of nitrogen fertiliser to produce wheat for breadmaking. Results A range of commercial wheat genotypes (cultivars) were grown in multiple field trials (six sites over 3 years) in the UK with optimal (200 kg Ha‐1) and suboptimal (150 kg Ha‐1) application of nitrogen. Bulked grain samples from four sites per year were milled and white flours were baked using three types of breadmaking process. This identified five cultivars that consistently exhibited good breadmaking quality when grown with the lower nitrogen application. Chemical and biochemical analyses showed that the five cultivars were characterised by exhibiting grain protein deviation (GPD) and high dough elasticity. Conclusions It is possible to develop novel types of wheat that exhibit good breadmaking quality by selecting for GPD and high dough strength. © 2023 The Authors.

However, establishing a solid physical connection between solar and tropospheric variability has posed a considerable challenge across the spectrum of Earth-system science. Over the past few years a new picture to describe solar variability has developed, based on observing, understanding and tracing the progression, interaction and intrinsic variability of the magnetized activity bands that belong to the Sun’s 22-year magnetic activity cycle. A solar cycle’s fiducial clock does not run from the canonical min or max, instead resetting when all old cycle polarity magnetic flux is cancelled at the equator, an event dubbed the “termination” of that solar cycle, or terminator. In a recent paper, we demonstrated with high statistical significance, a correlation between the occurrence of termination of the last five solar cycles and the transition from El Niño to La Niña in the Pacific Ocean, and predicted that there would be a transition to La Niña in mid 2020. La Niña did indeed begin in mid-2020, and endured into 2023 as a rare “triple dip” event, but some of the solar predictions made did not occur until late 2021. This work examines what went right, what went wrong, the correlations between El Niño, La Niña and geomagnetic activity indices, and what might be expected for the general trends of large-scale global climate in the next decade.",Frontiers in Earth Science,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2023.1204191/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/feart.2023.1204191?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2023.1204191, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It aims to motivate students by strengthening their academics, improving clinical and communication skills, and increasing their confidence. The underlying principles are to provide a clinical context and to ensure that the patient remains the centre of learning. The School of Nursing Sciences implemented this model in 2021 to produce hands-on Masters-level neonatal practitioners who can work in multidisciplinary clinical contexts. Therefore, this study explored the experiences of postgraduate nursing students on the Early and Enhanced Clinical Exposure model and draw implications for the future. Methods: A phenomenological study design was utilized at the University of Zambia, School of Nursing Sciences and comprised of eight Master of Science Neonatal Nursing students in their second year. Convenience sampling was used to select the study site and participants. Data was collected between 15th January 2023 and 31st January 2023 using an in-depth interview guide. Audio recording and notes were transcribed immediately after data collection. Data analysis was conducted using thematic analysis and codes and themes were constructed from the coded data. Ethical clearance and permission were sought before conducting the study. Results: Four major themes emerged from the study: identity and role confusion, challenging and hectic experiences, positive educational experiences, and personal and professional growth. These themes contributed to the promotion of evidence-based practice by helping students to assess, diagnose, and treat various conditions, as well as gain interest, experience, knowledge, and exposure. Conclusion: The model has a significant impact on motivation to learn, as evidenced by reported increased skill level with potential for use in clinical practice. It is recommended that it be implemented in all postgraduate programs for full-time students.",Open Journal of Nursing,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=125491', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10469329, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The importance of the translation process should not be ignored because it always involves the translation texts from one language into another. English and Arabic share some similarities and differences, so we must keep this in mind. Many linguistic problems arise during the translation process. Accordingly, this study aims to identify the grammatical problems that EFL learners face when translating from Arabic into English as a target language; design and implement a test to find out such grammatical problems that fourth year students face when translating from Arabic into English; and provide solutions for these problems that Iraqi EFL learners encounter in Arabic-English translation. This study hypothesizes that the interference of the mother tongue and literal translation lead to incorrect translation; the most frequent problems in Arabic-English translation are those related to tenses, nominal vs verbal sentences, and word order; and problems that learners do not suffer from in Arabic-English translation are adjectives and negation. The test is taken by the morning and evening participants at the Dept. of English, College of Education for Humanities, University of Thi-Qar, 100 students (morning and evening) take the test throughout the academic year (2022-2023). The test consists of 20 Arabic items and the students are required to translate them into English.

40866d268343b4e3c83fc773e9d31ec1e366a2bf,Satellite Lidar Measurements as a Critical New Global Ocean Climate Record,"The year 2023 marked the tenth anniversary of the first published description of global ocean plankton stocks based on measurements from a satellite lidar. Diverse studies have since been conducted to further refine and validate the lidar retrievals and use them to discover new characteristics of plankton seasonal dynamics and marine animal migrations, as well as evaluate geophysical products from traditional passive ocean color sensors. Surprisingly, all of these developments have been achieved with lidar instruments not designed for ocean applications. Over this same decade, we have witnessed unprecedented changes in ocean ecosystems at unexpected rates and driven by a multitude of environmental stressors, with a dominant factor being climate warming. Understanding, predicting, and responding to these ecosystem changes requires a global ocean observing network linking satellite, in situ, and modeling approaches. Inspired by recent successes, we promote here the creation of a lidar global ocean climate record as a key element in this envisioned advanced observing system. Contributing to this record, we announce the development of a new satellite lidar mission with ocean-observing capabilities and then discuss additional technological advances that can be envisioned for subsequent missions. Finally, we discuss how a potential near-term gap in global ocean lidar data might, at least partially, be filled using on-orbit or soon-to-be-launched lidars designed for other disciplinary purposes, and we identify upcoming needs for in situ support systems and science community development.",Remote Sensing,2023.0,7,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/23/5567/pdf?version=1701327195', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/rs15235567?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15235567, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7246249890d78d9177d8f7bea91ecb988baa011f,Road Infrastructure and Primate Conservation: Introducing the Global Primate Roadkill Database,"Simple Summary When wildlife cross roads, they risk fatality due to collisions with automobiles and motorbikes. As road infrastructure networks rapidly expand globally, especially in the tropics and subtropics, primates are increasingly at risk from these collisions. We created the Global Primate Roadkill Database (GPRD) as a comprehensive standardized repository to document incidents of primates killed by vehicular collisions. For each primate roadkill event, we recorded the species, location, and the year and month the incident was observed. As of February 2023, we collated over 2800 roadkill incidents, involving at least 107 primate species, from 41 countries. The lack of data from a large number of primate range countries did not necessarily indicate that primate roadkill events do not occur there, but more likely reflects underreporting. Given the value of these data for addressing both local and global research questions, we encourage conservationists and citizen scientists to contribute to the GPRD so that, together, we can better understand the impact road infrastructure has on primates. Abstract As road infrastructure networks rapidly expand globally, especially in the tropics, previously continuous habitats are being fragmented, resulting in more frequent wildlife–vehicle collisions (WVC). Primates are widespread throughout many sub-/tropical countries, and as their habitats are fragmented, they are increasingly at risk of WVC. We created the Global Primate Roadkill Database (GPRD), the largest available standardized database of primate roadkill incidents. We obtained data from published papers, un-published and citizen science databases, anecdotal reports, news reports, and social media posts. Here, we describe the collection methods for the GPRD and present the most up-to-date version of the database in full. For each primate roadkill incident, we recorded the species killed, the exact location, and the year and month the roadkill was observed. At the time of publication, the GPRD includes 2862 individual primate roadkill records from 41 countries. As primates range in more than twice as many countries, the absence of data from these countries is not necessarily indicative of a lack of primate vehicular collisions. Given the value of these data for addressing both local and global research questions, we encourage conservationists and citizen scientists to contribute to the GPRD so that, together, we can better understand the impact road infrastructure has on primates and evaluate measures which may help mitigate risk-prone areas or species.",Animals,2023.0,6,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/10/1692/pdf?version=1684492161', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10215684, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ac9af6ceee7e5cee86c8a1452f568e44d1067459,"A global long-term, high-resolution satellite radar backscatter data record (1992–2022+): merging C-band ERS/ASCAT and Ku-band QSCAT","Abstract. Satellite radar backscatter contains unique information on land surface moisture, vegetation features, and surface roughness and has thus been used in a range of Earth science disciplines. However, there is no single global radar data set that has a relatively long wavelength and a decades-long time span. We here provide the first long-term (since 1992), high-resolution (∼8.9 km instead of the commonly used ∼25 km resolution) monthly satellite radar backscatter data set over global land areas, called the long-term, high-resolution scatterometer (LHScat) data set, by fusing signals from the European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS; 1992–2001; C-band; 5.3 GHz), Quick Scatterometer (QSCAT, 1999–2009; Ku-band; 13.4 GHz), and the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT; since 2007; C-band; 5.255 GHz). The 6-year data gap between C-band ERS and ASCAT was filled by modelling a substitute C-band signal during 1999–2009 from Ku-band QSCAT signals and climatic information. To this end, we first rescaled the signals from different sensors, pixel by pixel. We then corrected the monthly signal differences between the C-band and the scaled Ku-band signals by modelling the signal differences from climatic variables (i.e. monthly precipitation, skin temperature, and snow depth) using decision tree regression. The quality of the merged radar signal was assessed by computing the Pearson r, root mean square error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (rRMSE) between the C-band and the corrected Ku-band signals in the overlapping years (1999–2001 and 2007–2009). We obtained high Pearson r values and low RMSE values at both the regional (r≥0.92, RMSE ≤ 0.11 dB, and rRMSE ≤ 0.38) and pixel levels (median r across pixels ≥ 0.64, median RMSE ≤ 0.34 dB, and median rRMSE ≤ 0.88), suggesting high accuracy for the data-merging procedure. The merged radar signals were then validated against the European Space Agency (ESA) ERS-2 data, which provide observations for a subset of global pixels until 2011, even after the failure of on-board gyroscopes in 2001. We found highly concordant monthly dynamics between the merged radar signals and the ESA ERS-2 signals, with regional Pearson r values ranging from 0.79 to 0.98. These results showed that our merged radar data have a consistent C-band signal dynamic. The LHScat data set (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20407857; Tao et al., 2023) is expected to advance our understanding of the long-term changes in, e.g., global vegetation and soil moisture with a high spatial resolution. The data set will be updated on a regular basis to include the latest images acquired by ASCAT and to include even higher spatial and temporal resolutions.

bdabb25028922c8c33e03f077fe27db089782f36,The Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory (SAIL) Campaign,"
The science of mountainous hydrology spans the atmosphere through the bedrock and inherently crosses physical and disciplinary boundaries: land-atmosphere interactions in complex terrain enhance clouds and precipitation, while watersheds retain and release water over a large range of spatial and temporal scales. Limited observations in complex terrain challenge efforts to improve predictive models of the hydrology in the face of rapid changes. The Upper Colorado River exemplifies these challenges, especially with ongoing mismatches between precipitation, snowpack, and discharge. Consequently, the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility has deployed an observatory to the East River Watershed near Crested Butte, Colorado between September 2021 and June 2023 to measure the main atmospheric drivers of water resources, including precipitation, clouds, winds, aerosols, radiation, temperature and humidity. This effort, called the Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory (SAIL), is also working in tandem with DOE-sponsored surface and subsurface hydrologists and other federal, state, and local partners. SAIL data can be benchmarks for model development by producing a wide range of observational information on precipitation and its associated processes, including those processes that impact snowpack sublimation and redistribution, aerosol direct radiative effects in the atmosphere and in the snowpack, aerosol impacts on clouds and precipitation, and processes controlling surface fluxes of energy and mass. Preliminary data from SAIL’s first year showcase the rich information content in SAIL’s many data-streams and support testing hypotheses that will ultimately improve scientific understanding and predictability of Upper Colorado River hydrology in 2023 and beyond.",Bulletin of The American Meteorological Society - (BAMS),2023.0,8,"{'url': 'https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/bams/104/12/BAMS-D-22-0049.1.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1175/bams-d-22-0049.1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1175/bams-d-22-0049.1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d0031c66b5ed1462f184eba99d9b68c2a39b4345,cnfishbase: A cyber Chinese fish database,"Fish constitute the largest group among vertebrates, accounting for more than half of all vertebrate species (Nelson et al., 2016), with new fish described each year. In the first edition of Fishes of the World, Nelson (1976) recorded 18 818 fish species from 450 families, which increased to 21 723 fish species from 445 families in the second edition (Nelson, 1984), 24 618 fish species from 482 families in the third edition (Nelson, 1994), 27 977 fish species from 515 families in the fourth edition (Nelson, 2006), and 32 000+ fish species from 536 families in the fifth edition (Nelson et al., 2016). According to the latest data from the FishBase database (March 2023), there are currently over 35 000 fish species belonging to 623 families worldwide. The substantial diversity of fish species presents a significant obstacle for domestic Chinese researchers in the field of ichthyology in acquiring both the scientific and Chinese nomenclature of fish species. Although various texts on fish taxonomy have been published in China over the last century (Zhang & Cao, 2021), many are now outdated or incomplete and lack adequate mechanisms for timely updates, thus hampering their application in contemporary fish biology research. Furthermore, the early publication times and reliance on traditional morphological classification methods in these previous publications fail to accurately reflect the current diversity and phylogenetic position of many fish species. Books serve as a simple and intuitive medium for the storage and preservation of small-scale data that do not require frequent modifications or updates. However, in biological directories where the classification status of organisms is subject to frequent changes, books present challenges for timely updates due to the high cost of reprinting or republishing. Some biological directories, which include numerous species and large-scale data, may go many years without timely updates or the incorporation of classification system revisions. Thus, the emerging trend is toward the digitization of biological directories. Utilizing databases for data storage offers several distinct advantages over conventional books: (1) Expedited access and retrieval: Databases enable rapid information retrieval through the application of query languages, which is vastly more efficient than browsing books. (2) Simultaneous multi-user support: Databases enable access for multiple users at the same time without data conflicts or errors. (3) Data persistence: Databases allow for ongoing storage without loss. (4) Data dissemination and collaboration: Databases facilitate the sharing of data and collaborative scientific inquiry. In the context of biological directories, which require frequent updates and changes, the costs of modifying information are reduced, and data retrieval can be achieved rapidly. The sharp increase in biological information has led to greater demand for database construction (Ball-Damerow et al., 2019). A major consideration in biodiversity science is the need to convert information accumulated over many years into an electronic format. Several international biodiversity databases have been created, each with varying purposes, content, and features. Although biodiversity is a global phenomenon, most databases dedicated to biodiversity have been established in developed countries (Shanmughavel, 2007). As such, many Chinese scientists have been actively engaged in the construction of domestic biodiversity databases. For example, the first iteration of the Catalogue of Life: China (CoL China) was released in 2008, with annual updates thereafter (Jiang et al., 2015). These catalogues, providing essential information about species names, taxonomic relationships, and distributions within China, serve as critical resources for advancing our understanding of the origins, evolution, and biodiversity conservation of such species (Mi et al., 2021). Considering the above, we developed and released the first version of a Chinese fish database (cnfishbase, https:// cnfishbase.cn/, Figure 1). The database was developed using the Python Django framework for web back-end functionality and the Bootstrap framework for web front-end display. MySQL was used for data storage and management, while the pyecharts package was used for fish data visualization. Notably, cnfishbase features the following sub-domains: (1) World Fish Database: This sub-domain incorporates information on 35 137 fish species belonging to 623 families and 93 orders obtained from the FishBase database (current as of March 2023; http://www.fishbase.org/), resulting in the inclusion of 30 463 Chinese names and 16 940 commonly used English names of fish species. Users can enter the name of the fish of interest in the search bar located at the top of the website to access relevant information. Upon selecting the FishBase link corresponding to a specific fish, users can retrieve more detailed information regarding the morphology, distribution, taxonomy, ecology, fishery, and aquaculture of that species. (2) Information by Country: This sub-domain encompasses a summary of fish statistics relating to 215 countries and regions around the globe. It offers a convenient means for users to ascertain the fish composition of each individual country or region. (3) Distribution Map: This subdomain contains the fish distribution maps of 33 641 species derived from the fish data relating to 215 countries and regions, thus covering more than 95% of fish species.

These studies presuppose that employee turnover behaviour can be predicted and proxied for by employee intention to quit equally well. There is a need for more bibliometric analysis available to explain the growth and structuring of the topic, even though earlier research has provided significant insights into the varied opinions, techniques, and concepts on ""occupational stress"" & ""turnover intention"". The main aim of this research is to map out ""Turnover Intention's"" growth from 2005 to 2023. This research is based on a comprehensive literature review from numerous scientific publications using the keywords ""Turnover"" and ""Intention"" to search the Scopus database. The 454 turnover intention publications published up to 2023 were evaluated using the following bibliometric techniques: author contribution, citation analysis, publication by year, documents by source and funding sponsor. Through this process, the evolution of the turnover intention of an employee over time is analyzed, the interrelated ideas constituting the discourse is delineated, and the most significant works relying on the SCOPUS database is pinpointed. The analysis findings indicate that 2022 is the year with the most significant turnover intention trends.

Yet, the difference in efficacy and safety between the commonly used integrated dual-screw cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) and single-screw cephalomedullary nail remains inconclusive. Thus we performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies comparing InterTAN with proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA), the Asian PFNA (PFNA-II), or the Gamma3 nail in treating IFF were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from inception to April 30, 2023. The differences in perioperative parameters and clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated by mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI). The risks of various complications and mortality were assessed by risk ratio (RR) with 95%CI. Results Twenty-three studies comprising 3566 patients were included. Compared with single-screw cephalomedullary nails (PFNA/PFNA-II, Gamma3), InterTAN conferred significantly reduced risk of implant failures (RR = 0.37, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.51, P  < 0.001), hip and thigh pain (RR = 0.70, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.90, P  = 0.006) and all-cause revision/reoperation (RR = 0.38, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.57, P  < 0.001). Moreover, patients treated with InterTAN had significantly higher 1-year Harris Hip Score (MD = 0.82, 95%CI 0.20–1.44, P  = 0.010) and shorter time to union/healing (MD = − 0.66 days, 95%CI  − 1.16 to  − 0.16, P  = 0.009). Femoral neck shortening, time to full bearing, and incidences of non-union, infection, deep venous thrombosis, and mortality were comparable between both groups. Conclusions The integrated dual-screw InterTAN construct has superior performance in reducing risks of complications and improving clinical and functional outcomes in the treatment of IFF.

These conditions increase the risk of falls and injuries in these populations. This study aimed to determine the effects of exercise on falls and consequent injuries among individuals with neurodegenerative diseases and frail aging people. Methods Electronic database searches were conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, SportDiscus, and Web of Science up to 1 January 2023. Randomized controlled trials that reported the effects of exercise on falls and fall-related injuries in neurodegenerative disease and frail aging people were eligible for inclusion. The intervention effects for falls, fractures, and injuries were evaluated by calculating the rate ratio (RaR) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Sixty-four studies with 13,241 participants met the inclusion criteria. Exercise is effective in reducing falls for frail aging people (RaR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68–0.82) and participants with ND (0.53, 0.43–0.65) [dementia (0.64, 0.51–0.82), Parkinson’s disease (0.49, 0.39–0.69), and stroke survivors (0.40, 0.27–0.57)]. Exercise also reduced fall-related injuries in ND patients (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48–0.90) and decreased fractures (0.63, 0.41–0.95) and fall-related injuries (0.89, 0.84–0.95) among frail aging people. For fall prevention, balance and combined exercise protocols are both effective, and either short-, moderate-, or long-term intervention duration is beneficial. More importantly, exercise only induced a very low injury rate per participant year (0.007%; 95% CI, 0–0.016) and show relatively good compliance with exercise (74.8; 95% CI, 69.7%–79.9%).

Additionally, this study aims to compare the outcomes of this procedure across various income situations. 
Methods: A systematic search strategy was conducted across several electronic reference databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Emcare databases up to August 3, 2023. Duplicate publications, review articles, editorials, and incomplete articles were excluded. 
Results: This study presents an updated version of a previously conducted systematic review, which was originally published in 2016. The inclusion criteria for this study encompassed reports that provided data on the occurrence of emergency peripartum hysterectomy. Emergency peripartum hysterectomy was operationally defined as the surgical extraction of the uterus due to severe obstetric problems within a period of up to 6 weeks following childbirth. The process of title and abstract screening, as well as full-text review, was conducted with Endnote data management software. Out of a total of 8,775 papers that were reviewed, a subset of 26 articles published after the year 2015 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Consequently, the overall number of studies included in the analysis amounted to 154. 
Conclusion: There are significant variations in the occurrence of emergency peripartum hysterectomy across different income contexts. Women residing in lower-income settings face an elevated likelihood of experiencing emergency peripartum hysterectomy, as well as a greater burden of associated morbidity and mortality.

And to construct prediction models to aid in the prediction and improvement of prognosis. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for relevant studies from inception to March 29, 2023. After completing literature screening and data extraction, we performed meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis to identify risk factors associated with OS and PFS. Using the pooled hazard ratio value for each risk factor, we constructed prediction models, which were then validated using datasets from 19 centers in Japan and two centers in China, comprising a total of 204 patients. Results A total of 47 studies, involving a total of 7649 ICI-treated HCC patients, were included in the meta-analysis. After analyzing 18 risk factors, we identified AFP, ALBI, NLR, ECOG performance status, Child-Pugh stage, BCLC stage, tumor number, vascular invasion and combination therapy as predictors for OS prediction model, while AFP, ALBI, NLR, ECOG performance status, Child-Pugh stage, BCLC stage, tumor number and vascular invasion were selected as predictors for PFS model. To validate the models, we scored two independent cohorts of patients using both prediction models. Our models demonstrated good performance in these cohorts. In addition, in the pooled cohort of 204 patients, Our models also showed good performance with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.712, 0.753, and 0.822 for the OS prediction model at 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year follow-up points, respectively, and AUC values of 0.575, 0.749 and 0.691 for the PFS prediction model Additionally, the calibration curve, decision curve analysis, and Kaplan-Meier curves in the pooled cohort all supported the validity of both models. Conclusion Based on the meta-analysis, we successfully constructed the OS and PFS prediction models for ICI-treated HCC patients.

5d17f1db05ab90b569b694b28faa5d69734b03ca,Spatiotemporally consistent global dataset of the GIMMS leaf area index (GIMMS LAI4g) from 1982 to 2020,"Abstract. Leaf area index (LAI) with an explicit biophysical meaning is a critical variable to characterize terrestrial ecosystems. Long-term global datasets of LAI have served as fundamental data support for monitoring vegetation dynamics and exploring its interactions with other Earth components. However, current LAI products face several limitations associated with spatiotemporal consistency. In this study, we employed the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and a data consolidation method to generate a new version of the half-month 1/12∘ Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) LAI product, i.e., GIMMS LAI4g, for the period 1982–2020. The significance of the GIMMS LAI4g was the use of the latest PKU GIMMS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product and 3.6 million high-quality global Landsat LAI samples to remove the effects of satellite orbital drift and sensor degradation and to develop spatiotemporally consistent BPNN models. The results showed that the GIMMS LAI4g exhibited overall higher accuracy and lower underestimation than its predecessor (GIMMS LAI3g) and two mainstream LAI products (Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI and Long-term Global Mapping (GLOBMAP) LAI) using field LAI measurements and Landsat LAI samples. Its validation against Landsat LAI samples revealed an R2 of 0.96, root mean square error of 0.32 m2 m−2, mean absolute error of 0.16 m2 m−2, and mean absolute percentage error of 13.6 % which meets the accuracy target proposed by the Global Climate Observation System. It outperformed other LAI products for most vegetation biomes in a majority area of the land. It efficiently eliminated the effects of satellite orbital drift and sensor degradation and presented a better temporal consistency before and after the year 2000. The consolidation with the reprocessed MODIS LAI allows the GIMMS LAI4g to extend the temporal coverage from 2015 to a recent period (2020), producing the LAI trend that maintains high consistency before and after 2000 and aligns with the reprocessed MODIS LAI trend during the MODIS era. The GIMMS LAI4g product could potentially facilitate mitigating the disagreements between studies of the long-term global vegetation changes and could also benefit the model development in earth and environmental sciences. The GIMMS LAI4g product is open access and available under Attribution 4.0 International at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7649107 (Cao et al., 2023).

3cce8f9a7d78d163d20c0ebcee1169008291e58c,PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES IN PEDIATRIC SEPTIC SHOCK: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,"Introduction: Sepsis is a major cause of mortality in pediatric populations, with 22 cases per 100,000 live births in infants and 2,202 cases per 100,000 live births in neonates, causing an annual burden of 1.2 million cases. There is currently no consensus regarding the most appropriate to measure the primary outcome of pediatric septic shock. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the primary outcome that should be assessed in pediatric patients who experience sepsis shock 
Methods: Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), we searched literature from several databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science) following PRISMA guidelines. The following keywords are used: ((Primary) AND (Outcome) AND (Measure) OR (Indicator) AND (Pediatric) OR (Childern) AND (Septic) AND (Shock)). Manual searches are also conducted to get relevant articles that meet the mentioned criteria. Data were extracted based on author, year, study design, sample size, results and discussion. 
Results: In this systematic review, we found a total of five studies, with three types of prospective studies and two retrospective studies. A total of 5.164 cases were involved in the study, with a range years 2014 to 2023. Of the five studies, all discussed that mortality was the primary outcome measured in pediatric patients with septic shock. Other indicators that can be measured as outcomes in patients are length of hospitalization, clearance from lactic acid, and occurrence of multiple organ disfunction. 
Conclusion: In pediatric patients with sepsis shock there are several primary outcomes that can be assessed. Some literature suggests that mortality is a major outcome to be considered.",Journal of Advance Research in Medical &amp; Health Science (ISSN: 2208-2425),2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://nnpub.org/index.php/MHS/article/download/1817/1268', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.53555/nnmhs.v9i8.1817?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.53555/nnmhs.v9i8.1817, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2483abb585d0cb715c5b7c197778c9e4824dd21e,Health-related social media use : A systematic review,"Social media has been well-established in health-related purposes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary reviews have summarized social media uses for a distinctive health purpose such as health interventions, health campaigns, medical education, and disease outbreak surveillance. The most recent thorough review of social media uses for health purposes, however, was conducted in 2013. A systematic review that covers various health purposes is needed to reveal the new usages and research gaps that emerge in recent years. This study aimed to provide a systematic review of social media uses for health purposes that have been identified in previous studies. The researchers searched for peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2010 and 2020 in.10 databases covering medicine, public health, and social science. After classifying the articles in terms of publication year, journal area, country, method, social media platform, and social media use for health purposes, the researchers provided a review of social media use for health purposes identified in these articles. This study summarized 7 social media uses for various health purposes by health organizations, health researchers and practitioners, and the public. Social media can be used for various health purposes. Several new usages have emerged since 2013 including advancing health research and practice, social mobilization, and facilitating offline health-related services and events. Research gaps exist regarding advancing strategic use of social media based on audience segmentation, understanding the impact of health identity development, and addressing privacy concerns and evaluating the impact of social media in health interventions. © 2023 Author(s).",ADVANCES IN MATERIAL SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1063/5.0132822?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0132822, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Initial media stories about ChatGPT highlighted the speed with which it generated new material as evidence that this tool might be both genuinely creative and actually intelligent, in both exciting and disturbing ways. Indeed, ChatGPT is part of a larger pool of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that can very quickly generate seemingly novel outputs in a variety of media formats based on text prompts written by users. Yet, claims that AI has become sentient, or has even reached a recognisable level of general intelligence, remain in the realm of science fiction, for now at least (Leaver). That has not stopped technology companies, scientists, and others from suggesting that super-smart AI is just around the corner. Exemplifying this, the same people creating generative AI are also vocal signatories of public letters that ostensibly call for a temporary halt in AI development, but these letters are simultaneously feeding the myth that these tools are so powerful that they are the early form of imminent super-intelligent machines.
For many people, the combination of AI technologies and media hype means generative AIs are basically magical insomuch as their workings seem impenetrable, and their existence could ostensibly change the world. This article explores how the hype around ChatGPT and generative AI was deployed across the first six months of 2023, and how these technologies were positioned as either utopian or dystopian, always seemingly magical, but never banal. We look at some initial responses to generative AI, ranging from schools in Australia to picket lines in Hollywood. We offer a critique of the utopian/dystopian binary positioning of generative AI, aligning with critics who rightly argue that focussing on these extremes displaces the more grounded and immediate challenges generative AI bring that need urgent answers. Finally, we loop back to the role of schools and educators in repositioning generative AI as something to be tested, examined, scrutinised, and played with both to ground understandings of generative AI, while also preparing today’s students for a future where these tools will be part of their work and cultural landscapes.
Hype, Schools, and Hollywood
In December 2022, one month after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Elon Musk tweeted: “ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI”. Musk’s post was retweeted 9400 times, liked 73 thousand times, and presumably seen by most of his 150 million Twitter followers. This type of engagement typified the early hype and language that surrounded the launch of ChatGPT, with reports that “crypto” had been replaced by generative AI as the “hot tech topic” and hopes that it would be “‘transformative’ for business” (Browne). By March 2023, global economic analysts at Goldman Sachs had released a report on the potentially transformative effects of generative AI, saying that it marked the “brink of a rapid acceleration in task automation that will drive labor cost savings and raise productivity” (Hatzius et al.). Further, they concluded that “its ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects” (Hatzius et al.). Speculation about the potentially transformative power and reach of generative AI technology was reinforced by warnings that it could also lead to “significant disruption” of the labour market, and the potential automation of up to 300 million jobs, with associated job losses for humans (Hatzius et al.). In addition, there was widespread buzz that ChatGPT’s “rationalization process may evidence human-like cognition” (Browne), claims that were supported by the emergent language of ChatGPT. The technology was explained as being “trained” on a “corpus” of datasets, using a “neural network” capable of producing “natural language“” (Dsouza), positioning the technology as human-like, and more than ‘artificial’ intelligence. Incorrect responses or errors produced by the tech were termed “hallucinations”, akin to magical thinking, which OpenAI founder Sam Altman insisted wasn’t a word that he associated with sentience (Intelligencer staff). Indeed, Altman asserts that he rejects moves to “anthropomorphize” (Intelligencer staff) the technology; however, arguably the language, hype, and Altman’s well-publicised misgivings about ChatGPT have had the combined effect of shaping our understanding of this generative AI as alive, vast, fast-moving, and potentially lethal to humanity.
Unsurprisingly, the hype around the transformative effects of ChatGPT and its ability to generate ‘human-like’ answers and sophisticated essay-style responses was matched by a concomitant panic throughout educational institutions. The beginning of the 2023 Australian school year was marked by schools and state education ministers meeting to discuss the emerging problem of ChatGPT in the education system (Hiatt). Every state in Australia, bar South Australia, banned the use of the technology in public schools, with a “national expert task force” formed to “guide” schools on how to navigate ChatGPT in the classroom (Hiatt). Globally, schools banned the technology amid fears that students could use it to generate convincing essay responses whose plagiarism would be undetectable with current software (Clarence-Smith). Some schools banned the technology citing concerns that it would have a “negative impact on student learning”, while others cited its “lack of reliable safeguards preventing these tools exposing students to potentially explicit and harmful content” (Cassidy). ChatGPT investor Musk famously tweeted, “It’s a new world. Goodbye homework!”, further fuelling the growing alarm about the freely available technology that could “churn out convincing essays which can't be detected by their existing anti-plagiarism software” (Clarence-Smith). Universities were reported to be moving towards more “in-person supervision and increased paper assessments” (SBS), rather than essay-style assessments, in a bid to out-manoeuvre ChatGPT’s plagiarism potential. Seven months on, concerns about the technology seem to have been dialled back, with educators more curious about the ways the technology can be integrated into the classroom to good effect (Liu et al.); however, the full implications and impacts of the generative AI are still emerging.
In May 2023, the Writer’s Guild of America (WGA), the union representing screenwriters across the US creative industries, went on strike, and one of their core issues were “regulations on the use of artificial intelligence in writing” (Porter). Early in the negotiations, Chris Keyser, co-chair of the WGA’s negotiating committee, lamented that “no one knows exactly what AI’s going to be, but the fact that the companies won’t talk about it is the best indication we’ve had that we have a reason to fear it” (Grobar). At the same time, the Screen Actors’ Guild (SAG) warned that members were being asked to agree to contracts that stipulated that an actor’s voice could be re-used in future scenarios without that actor’s additional consent, potentially reducing actors to a dataset to be animated by generative AI technologies (Scheiber and Koblin). In a statement issued by SAG, they made their position clear that the creation or (re)animation of any digital likeness of any part of an actor must be recognised as labour and properly paid, also warning that any attempt to legislate around these rights should be strongly resisted (Screen Actors Guild). Unlike the more sensationalised hype, the WGA and SAG responses to generative AI are grounded in labour relations. These unions quite rightly fear the immediate future where human labour could be augmented, reclassified, and exploited by, and in the name of, algorithmic systems. Screenwriters, for example, might be hired at much lower pay rates to edit scripts first generated by ChatGPT, even if those editors would really be doing most of the creative work to turn something clichéd and predictable into something more appealing. Rather than a dystopian world where machines do all the work, the WGA and SAG protests railed against a world where workers would be paid less because executives could pretend generative AI was doing most of the work (Bender).
The Open Letter and Promotion of AI Panic
In an open letter that received enormous press and media uptake, many of the leading figures in AI called for a pause in AI development since “advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth”; they warned early 2023 had already seen “an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control” (Future of Life Institute). Further, the open letter signatories called on “all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4”, arguing that “labs and independent experts should use this pause to jointly develop and implement a set of shared safety protocols for advanced AI design and development that are rigorously audited and overseen by independent outside experts” (Future of Life Institute). Notably, many of the signatories work for the very companies involved in the “out-of-control race”. Indeed, while this letter could be read as a moment of ethical clarity for the AI industry, a more cynical reading might just be that in warning that their AIs could effectively destroy the world, th",M/C Journal,2023.0,16,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.5204/mcj.3004', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5204/mcj.3004?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5204/mcj.3004, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 Dr. George W. Kattawar is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Physics & Astronomy and the Institute of Quantum Science & Engineering at Texas A&M University. He is an internationally renowned expert in radiative transfer and light scattering dealing with full Mueller matrix/Stokes vector processes. He has made significant contributions in using radiative transfer in such diverse areas as biomedical optics, planetary atmospheres, cloud and aerosol property studies related to climate studies, invisibility cloaking, ultrashort laser propagation in water, and anthrax detection. To list just a few among his seminal contributions, he was the first to show that the clouds of Venus were not water, which was the view held by two eminent scientists Carl Sagan and Richard Goody. It was this seminal work which led to the ultimate determination of the Venus cloud composition. He is one of the first researchers to apply Monte Carlo techniques to radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres. This technique is now being used by researchers all over the world and is also now being used in medical physics. He gave the first correct explanation of the “Ring effect” which had remained an enigma for over twenty years. This paper was designated by a world-renowned scientist at NASA to be the best paper of the decade in atmospheric science. Dr. Kattawar and his collaborators developed one of the most powerful time dependent, three-dimensional Monte Carlo codes capable of handling full Mueller matrix solutions for a coupled atmosphere-ocean system with a fully stochastic interface. This code will become the “Gold Standard” for all future researchers in biomedical, atmospheric, and oceanic optics. He is one of the first to show that nonspherical objects can be made totally invisible if the optical properties are selected in the right way. Dr. Kattawar received many awards and recognitions, including Fellow of the Optical Society of America (1976); Amoco Foundation Teaching Excellence Award (1981); Teacher/Scholar Award (1990), Nils Gunnar Jerlov Award (2014), and van de Hulst Light Scattering Award (2015); He was also elected for two, three-year terms on the Committee on Recommendations for U.S. Army Basic Scientific Research under the National Research Council.

The challenge of managing increasing quantity of waste, particularly from agro-food industry, represents a significant cost to society and puts pressure on the natural environment. But this by-product material also represents a valuable resource, which can be exploited by embracing a more circular economy that reduces waste and allows for the continual use of resources. Today's ""take-make-dispose"" economic model is wasteful and unsustainable. Research institutes, enterprises, academic institutes are therefore plotting ways to reuse products or their components via the circular economy and restore more of their precious materials and energy. This practice will help to conserve environment and to protect society from the impacts of climate change.
On the other hand, it has been commonly used the definition ""non-conventional feed resources"" that generally refer to all those feeds that have not been traditionally used for feeding livestock and are not commercially used in the production of livestock feeds. Several known examples include palm leaf meals, palm press fiber, cassava foliage, spent brewer's grains, sugar cane bagasse, rubber seed meal and some aquatic plants. Defined in this manner non-conventional feed resources (NCFR) can be looked at as covering a wide diversity of feeds and their nutrient contents. A common feature about feeds is that the traditional feeds tend to be mainly from annual crops and feeds of animal and industrial origin. In this sense, the usage of ""non-conventional feed resources"" could really be more appropriately referred to as ""new feeds"", and this term is increasingly being used. Thus the term NCFR has been frequently used to describe sources such as oil palm by-products, single-cell proteins and feed materials derived from agro-industrial by-products of plant and animal origin, poor-quality cellulosic roughages from farm residues and other agro- industrial by-products such as slaughter-house by-products and those from the processing of sugar, cereal grains, citrus fruits and vegetables from the processing of food for human consumption. However, it is sometimes difficult to draw a distinct line between traditional feeds and NCFR. In some countries what may now be classified as NCFR may in fact be conventional / traditional owing to the fact that it may have been in use as livestock feed over a long time, an example is wheat straw which is very widely used in South Asian countries, in addition, the availability of NCFR, especially of plant origin, is dependent to a large extent on the type of crops being cultivated and the prevailing degree of application of the crop technology.
In the framework of applied science as tool for livestock practice, to successfully control reproduction, obtain primary genetic material, gametes, oocytes, eggs and spermatozoa in the field of reproduction, the use of various biotechnological methods has been practiced for many years. Artificial insemination of livestock has been a staple technology for producers worldwide for over sixty years. This reproductive technology has allowed for the rapid improvement of livestock genetics, most notably in dairy cattle and pigs. The primary benefit of utilizing artificial insemination is the ability to rapidly improve the genetic quality of a herd using a premier male animal's genetics without a producer having to purchase that specific male. Despite its massive contributions to livestock production, there are numerous ways in which artificial insemination can be improved. These improvements are driven by new technologies and deeper understanding of reproductive physiology.
In the third Editorial article of 2023, I am going to introduce the contents of the articles collected and published in the third issue of 2023 year.
Agbetuyi et al. investigated on broiler chickens to determine the dietary effect on organoleptic attributes, tibia bone growth and mineral retention feeding Moringa oleifera leaf powder and Allium sativum bulb powder. Authors recommended the safe and profitable usage in animal feed industry in the extend of 1 % of Moringa oleifera leaf powder and 0.1 % of Allium sativum bulb powder.
Akinduro et al. designed a study to investigate the effect of fermented dried pawpaw seed fed at varying level of inclusion in the diets of broiler chicken at finisher stage on their general performance, carcass and organs characteristics. The result of this study showed that the use of the fermented dried pawpaw seed flour can be tolerated up to about 10 % inclusion as it gave the lowest FCR (feed conversion ratio) which could bring about high profitability, hence, encourage more people to go into Poultry business.
Olanloye et al. published a study aimed at predicting and evaluating the variation in the amino acids of cassava roots from their crude protein. The results indicated that equations generated for Total Essential Amino acid (TEA) and Total Amino Acid (TAA) revealed that r2 increased as the number of variables increased. Prediction equations generated values for TEA and TAA of cassava roots were much close to the actual values obtained.
Mekonnen & Berhe performed a survey to assess the efficiency and role of artificial insemination (AI) service in cattle production in the Western Zone of Tigray Region, Ethiopia. The overall conception rate at first insemination (CRFI) was also very poor and thus calving rate (CR) was poor. The approach of the artificial insemination service system should be revised and modified to improve the existing poor AI reproductive efficiency.

47663f81e71ec289ae4512b08da0cf7c7dafa413,"ChatGPT, AI Advertising, and Advertising Research and Education","Since ChatGPT was released on November 30, 2022, followed by Microsoft’s announcement of its artificial intelligence (AI)–powered new Bing search engine on February 7, 2023, and Google’s Bard release on March 21, 2023, it seems AI generally has taken over conversations across all sectors of society. In a very short time span, consumers and a wide range of organizations have adopted generative AI technologies with astonishing capabilities (Bove 2023). These new technological developments have accelerated the integration of AI into many tools, apps, and areas of our daily life, but the transformative AI technology is perhaps most deeply impacting the world of advertising. AI-enabled advertising spending worldwide in 2022 was estimated to be $370 billion, with predictions of $1.3 trillion in the next ten years (Statista 2023). While the viral sensation and enormous popularity of ChatGPT are generating unprecedented attention and interest in AI right now, AI, as both a theoretical concept and version of its technological implementations and applications, has a long history with its origin going back to the 1950s. In the advertising field, the first research article on the topic of AI in connection to advertising was published in 1988 (Cook and Schleede 1988). The authors described “decision support systems” (i.e., expert systems) as probably the “most widely implemented and well-known applications of AI” (48). As described, these systems used databases and models to solve problems, such as help with direct-mail systems and newspaper advertising placement. Since then, AI has changed the business of media and advertising and attracted attention from both advertising practitioners and scholars. Although there is no standard definition, Rodgers (2021) defined AI advertising as “brand communication that uses a range of machine functions that learn to carry out tasks with intent to persuade with input by humans, machines, or both” (2) and positioned AI advertising as a subdiscipline of advertising “situated at the intersection of cognitive science, computer science, and advertising” (2). Advertisers are using AI technologies in automated market segmentation and targeting, ad creative development and personalization, improving ad buying and placement, and optimizing advertising investment (Kietzmann, Paschen, and Treen 2018). Following the trend of increasing AI adoption in advertising, advertising scholars have organized sessions at the American Academy of Advertising (AAA) conference, such as the 2014 preconference, “Big Data for Advertising Research and Education,” and the joint AAA-ANA Educational Foundation luncheon panel with the provocative title, “The Future of Advertising—Will We Be Replaced by Robots?” in 2018. The Journal of Advertising (JA) has published multiple themed collections on AI-related topics, starting with a Special Section on Artificial Intelligence and Advertising, guest-edited by Hairong Li (2019). This collection of articles explored the potential and actual application of AI technologies to enhance advertising efficiency, effects, and effectiveness across the entire spectrum of the advertising campaign process, from situation analysis and consumer insight generation to advertising message creation, to media planning and buying, and to advertising effect assessment (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 48, no. 4). Another Special Section on Advances in Computational Advertising in 2020, guest edited by Jisu Huh and Ed Malthouse (2020), addressed broad implications of evolving computer science technologies for data-driven, AI-powered computational advertising, and proposed a future research agenda in the areas of macro and exogenous factors, consumers’ roles in computational advertising, AI-powered ad content generation, computational advertising media planning strategy shifts from purchasing exposure to focusing on meaningful consumer engagement, and computational advertising measurement systems (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 49, no. 4). A year later, JA published an up-to-date comprehensive Themed Issue on Promises and Perils of Artificial Intelligence and Advertising (2021, vol. 50, no. 1). In her editorial, the previous editor, Shelly Rodgers (2021) proposed an AI classification schema to systematically understand and develop subdomains",Journal of Advertising,2023.0,45,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00913367.2023.2227013?needAccess=true&role=button', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/00913367.2023.2227013?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2023.2227013, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1bdabac2c08e931f9fbc3745f8511312d111eef5,An Exhaustive Review of Neutrosophic Logic in Addressing Image Processing Issues,"Since the importance of images in our lives and the advancements in computer data gathering methods, anyone can collect a large number of images, but most of them cannot be processed manually. Image processing therefore becomes appealing since various types of data may be represented and processed digitally. Image processing has become the most popular processing method, employed in security camera films, healthcare images, images from remote sensors, and naturalistic image/videos because of fast computers and processors. In order to raise cognitive function and speed up decision-making, image processing is crucial to many information access systems. Since ambiguity now permeates every part of the world, including images, discussing the neutrosophic logic forms the central idea of this discussion, as it is able to handle this ambiguity. To apply the neutrosophic logic, this requires converting the image into neutrosophic reasoning. When using neutrosophic reasoning for image retrieval, average recall and precision measures improve over other approaches. As the image processing field covers several tracks such as image segmentation, noise reduction, image classification, and others. Because there are so many research articles published in this field every year, we thought it would be appropriate to introduce a survey study on this subject. As a result, this study offers a comprehensive assessment of the literature on applying neutrosophic logic to image processing problems that have surfaced during the previous five years (2019–2023).",Neutrosophic Systems with Applications,2023.0,9,"{'url': 'https://nswajournal.org/index.php/nswa/article/download/110/81', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.61356/j.nswa.2023.110?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.61356/j.nswa.2023.110, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2ae35cbdd86a619bc7060783a9078b2bbedf3ff6,Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate Performance: Does Financial Reporting Quality Matter?,"This study aims to analyze the role of social responsibility in times of crisis, where the study examines whether the role of social responsibility in the corporate performance will depend on its interaction with other basic aspects of the corporate business environment. In the contemporary economic context, information environment considers important aspects of the business environment, therefore, it can be suggested that the impact of social responsibility on the company's performance will be clearer when considering its interaction with financial reporting quality. To test this argument, data from the Saudi business environment for the year 2020 was collected to explore the relationship between social responsibility and the company's financial performance during the Corona pandemic, and the role of the financial reporting quality in that relationship. The results were largely consistent with the general argument of the study, the results showed that social responsibility does not affect the financial performance, but the interaction between it and the financial reporting quality positively affects the financial performance of the company during the pandemic period. Therefore, financial reporting quality play a major role in the extent to which social responsibility affects performance. The results represent a motivation for the various parties in the business environment to pay attention to the general framework of the company's business aspects when analyzing performance. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.",Information Sciences Letters,2023.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18576/isl/120420?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18576/isl/120420, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

07a90fdd97d40e80da445881d5ae5afd11f2f929,Test-retest reliability of the neuroanatomical correlates of impulsive personality traits in the adolescent brain cognitive development study.,"While the neuroanatomical correlates of impulsivity in youths have been examined, there is little research on whether those correlates are consistent across childhood/adolescence. The current study uses data from the age 11/12 (N = 7,083) visit of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study to investigate the replicability of previous work (Owens et al., 2020) the neuroanatomical correlates of impulsive personality traits identified at age 9/10. Neuroanatomy was measured using structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, and impulsive personality was measured using the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale. Replicability was quantified using three Open Science Collaboration replication criteria, intraclass correlations, and elastic net regression modeling to make predictions across timepoints. Replicability was highly variable among traits: The neuroanatomical correlates of positive urgency showed substantial similarity between ages 9/10 and 11/12, negative urgency and sensation seeking showed moderate similarity across ages, and (lack of) premeditation and perseverance showed substantial dissimilarity across ages. In all cases, effect sizes between impulsive traits and brain variables were small. These findings suggest that, even for studies with large sample sizes and the same participant pool, the replicability of brain-behavior correlations across a 2-year period cannot be assumed. This may be due to developmental changes across the two timepoints or false-positive/false-negative results at one or both timepoints. These results also highlight an array of neuroanatomical structures that may be important to impulsive personality traits across development from childhood into adolescence.

ef729473093e607a2caaf67644c9299dd0be1856,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as promoter of Open Research,"An online interview with Ashley Farley, program officer of Knowledge and Research Services at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. As of 2023, the Gates Foundation earmarks some 8,000,000,000 US Dollars annually to its various philanthropic goals. Focusing on global health and global development, the Gates Foundation supports a wide range of research and development activities in fields such as child nutrition, family planning, eradication of poverty and diseases, etc. In this podcast, Farley explains why open research lies at the heart of the Gates Foundation’s strategies. 
The Gates Foundation has been an early adopter and partner of the European Plan S initiative, which from the very start has been very well aligned to its own policies. Gates Foundation grantees are obliged to make all publications stemming from project funding available in open access, and, if possible, to archive their research datasets openly as well. The Gates Open Research Platform (a combination of a preprint-service and a megajournal) is an alternative route for grantees who do not want to publish their articles through traditional publication outlets. Accompanying datasets are stored elsewhere but with links from the platform. In addition, the non-profit organization OA.Works helps the Gates Foundation monitor that requirements are met. Among other things, OA.Works has been instrumental in setting up a Share Your Paper service to help researchers (not just grantees of the Gates Foundation) verify whether a version of their article can be legally uploaded to the Green Open Access repository Zenodo. Farley is also working directly with publishers to make sure that Gold Open Access that has been paid for is provided properly and in line with the contract. The Biden Administration recently announced a Year of Open Science in the USA. Farley sees various agencies, such as NASA, as driving forces behind this declaration. Gradually, a cultural shift is bound to take place, as prejudices towards open sharing of data, peer review reports and even grant applications will be replaced with a culture permeated by more open and transparent ways of doing research, Farley argues. She also argues strongly in favor of the Rights Retention Strategy and sees it as a way of empowering researchers by securing that they have more control of their work.

0c1d3bfaacc3750105411672f3caa7a7972a01c9,Integrating climate change into nursing curricula and continuing education: a scoping review protocol,"Introduction Climate change constitutes a major threat to human health. Nurses have an essential role to play in protecting populations from this threat, and to fulfil this role, they must be properly prepared. The purpose of this scoping review is to examine studies on the integration of climate change into the academic curriculum or continuing education of nurses so as to identify issues and opportunities related to this integration. Methods and analysis The method being used is the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley and Levac et al. First, a search strategy using keywords and their combinations will be developed. This strategy will be applied in four bibliographic databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science. Second, an initial selection of studies based on titles and abstracts will be carried out by two members of the research team using the software Covidence. They will conduct this selection process independently, with the aim of identifying relevant studies that meet the inclusion criteria for our scoping review. Third, the second stage in the selection process will be carried out by examining the full text of each article to determine which studies to include in the review. Finally, data on year of publication, authors, geographical area, article type, study objectives, methodology and key findings will be extracted from selected articles for analysis. A search of the grey literature will also be conducted to supplement the results of the bibliographic database search. The scoping review is currently ongoing. Identification of relevant literature began in the first quarter of 2022 and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2023. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this review. The results of this study will be presented in workshops and conferences and be submitted for publication to a peer-reviewed journal.",BMJ Open,2023.0,7,"{'url': 'https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/13/1/e068520.full.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9890745, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

965dae550cfcfa412fef84340fdf2ce60e277fcd,Global crisis in water management: Can a second UN Water Conference help?,"More than 60 years ago, President John F. Kennedy said: “Anyone who can solve the problems of water will be worthy of two Nobel Prizes—one for peace and one for science.” During the past six decades, global water situations, both in terms of quantity and quality, have become progressively worse and increasingly more and more complex. It has already been abundantly clear during the past six decades, unlike Kennedy's view, the world's water problems are primarily political, and not scientific or technical, and, thus, can be best approached and solved through political processes in each country, state, or municipality. Scientific or technical advances may solve some specific water‐related problems, but the main solutions remain, and will continue to remain, in the political realm. Unfortunately, however, even though the main solutions are political, very, very few political leaders, in any country in the world, have shown interest in water over prolonged periods of time. They are interested in water only when there is a serious flood or drought. Once the flood or the drought is over, their interest in water invariably disappears (Biswas, 2019). President Kennedy was no exception as a political leader. His interest in water did not last very long, in fact, less than 1 year. Yet, no water problem of the world can be solved over the long‐term unless seniormost politicians continue to remain interested in water. The only exception during the past 60 years has been Singapore. Its Prime Minister for the 1959–1990 period, Lee Kuan Yew, was convinced that water is a strategic resource, and Singapore's very survival and future economic development depended on ensuring water security. Accordingly, he had three people in his office who analyzed all national policies through the lens of water, both in terms of quantity and quality. He told us, as far as he was concerned, all policies Singapore, adopted during his tenure, had to bend in the knee for water (Tortajada et al., 2013). In 1959, when Lee Kuan Yew became the Prime Minister, Singapore's water management practices were similar to any other Third World city, from Delhi to Dakar. By the time Lee stepped down as the Prime Minister in 1990, Singapore's water management had become the envy of the world. Under Lee's leadership, Singapore formulated a long‐ term water security plan for 2060. It has been rigorously and regularly updated every 5 years, thereafter reviewed by the entire cabinet and its implementation has always been carefully monitored. Fortunately, the interest of Singapore's top policymakers in water has steadfastly remained high during the post‐Lee period. Political leaders of any other country, developed or developing, could follow Singapore's footsteps regarding water's high political priority. As global water situations have mostly deteriorated, discussions of the resulting crises have become a growth industry. Putting “water crisis” in Google, in early March 2023, resulted in the identification of 805 million items. The number is likely to continue increasing exponentially in the coming years, especially if water situations continue to decline in most countries of the world.",River,2023.0,3,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/rvr2.40', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/rvr2.40?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/rvr2.40, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4e26831a7f98da57a9a895e5aa9ea805c76006e3,"InSAR-based method for deformation monitoring of landslide source area in Baihetan reservoir, China","As a cascading disaster, the surge caused by the reservoir bank landslide seriously affects the stability of the reservoir bank and the dam body. In addition, large-scale hydropower projects are usually built in mountain and canyon areas with active geological structure movement, which provides rich material sources for the occurrence of landslides, so it is of great significance to monitor the deformation in the landslide source area of the reservoir. As science and technology have been leaping forward, a wide variety of high and novel technologies have been proposed, which can be adopted to monitor landslide deformation. It is noteworthy that InSAR is capable of monitoring target monitoring areas all time under all weathers without the need to install any equipment. In this study, the time series deformation of the main landslide source area of the Baihetan reservoir after water storage was determined based on the time series InSAR method. The average annual deformation rate of the landslide source area of the Baihetan reservoir from April 2021 to January 2023 was determined by combining the Sentinel-1 SAR data of 55 ascending tracks and 46 descending tracks. Moreover, the vegetation cover variations from April 2021 to January 2023 in the study area were determined by combining the remote sensing data of Landsat8-9. A total of four typical source areas were selected based on the field investigation to analyze the deformation monitoring results and the vegetation cover variations. As indicated by the results: 1) After water storage, the slope deformation in all source areas was larger in the short term, and the deformation rate of the lower part turned out to be more significant, and the deformation rate exceeded 334.583 mm/year. 2) On the steep slope, the effect of different types of vegetation on restraining deformation was different. The optimal effect was reported in shrubs, followed by grasslands, and the worst effect was reported in woodlands.

9bc6ea87991ae166a7697d0162acfccc042197b8,Realized Genetic Gain in Rice: Achievements from Breeding Programs,"Genetic improvement is crucial for ensuring food security globally. Indeed, plant breeding has contributed significantly to increasing the productivity of major crops, including rice, over the last century. Evaluating the efficiency of breeding strategies necessitates a quantification of this progress. One approach involves assessing the genetic gain achieved through breeding programs based on quantitative traits. This study aims to provide a theoretical understanding of genetic gain, summarize the major results of genetic gain studies in rice breeding, and suggest ways of improving breeding program strategies and future studies on genetic gain. To achieve this, we present the concept of genetic gain and the essential aspects of its estimation. We also provide an extensive literature review of genetic gain studies in rice ( Oryza sativa L.) breeding programs to understand the advances made to date. We reviewed 29 studies conducted between 1999 and 2023, covering different regions, traits, periods, and estimation methods. The genetic gain for grain yield, in particular, showed significant variation, ranging from 1.5 to 167.6 kg/ha/year, with a mean value of 36.3 kg/ha/year. This translated into a rate of genetic gain for grain yield ranging from 0.1% to over 3.0%. The impact of multi-trait selection on grain yield was clarified by studies that reported genetic gains for other traits, such as plant height, days to flowering, and grain quality. These findings reveal that while breeding programs have achieved significant gains, further improvements are necessary to meet the growing demand for rice. We also highlight the limitations of these studies, which hinder accurate estimations of genetic gain. In conclusion, we offer suggestions for improving the estimation of genetic gain based on quantitative genetic principles and computer simulations to optimize rice breeding strategies.",Rice,2023.0,10,"{'url': 'https://thericejournal.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12284-023-00677-6', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10724102, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f0003086d010c99428184d8518d9483bcc98dc36,A Scoping Review of Correctional-Based Interventions for Women Prisoners with Mental Health Problems,"Women prisoners are a population at a high risk of experiencing stress, anxiety, and other mental health problems. This is because stressors in prisons, such as strict prison rules, intimidation, and conflicts with other inmates and staff, cause a high prevalence of mental health problems in women prisoners. Mental health services, such as correctional-based interventions, are an important part of overcoming these problems. Therefore, this study aimed to identify correctional-based interventions for women prisoners with mental health problems, specifically to determine the types of correctional-based interventions, the types of mental health problems experienced by women prisoners, and the effectiveness of the interventions. The method used was a scoping review based on Arksey and O’Malley’s framework. Articles were searched using Scopus, CINAHL, PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar with the keywords “Mental Health Care” OR “Mental Health Services” AND “Correctional Program” AND “Interventions” AND “Mental Disorder” OR “Mental Health Problems” AND Women” OR “Female” AND “Inmates” OR “Offenders” OR “Prisoners” OR “Convicts”. The inclusion criteria used were the year of publication (2000–2023), full-text articles in English, and the study sample was women prisoners with mental health problems. After selection, a total of 10 articles were found to meet the review inclusion criteria.

14c6f1327bab398a57a6efcae07506222ddad898,Exploring experiences of times without care and encounters in dementia: protocol for a living and adaptive evidence map,"Introduction Individuals with dementia spend most of the day without care, without encounters, and usually without activity. Although this has been proven in studies, there is a knowledge gap on how individuals with dementia experience these periods of time. Such knowledge would be highly relevant for health professionals and relatives to develop adequate strategies for dealing with these periods of time. The FreiZeit study aims to reconstruct periods of time without care and encounters from the perspective of individuals with dementia and formal and informal carers. The specific objective of this review is to provide a continuously updated overview of the topical evidence that may be used to guide data synthesis and interpretation within the FreiZeit study. Methods and analysis We conduct a living evidence map, based on a comprehensive systematic literature search in MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO/Ovid and Web of Science Core Collection, citation-based searches and web searches. We include studies on times without care and encounters of individuals with dementia from the perspective of individuals with dementia themselves and formal or informal caregivers of any observational study design that were conducted in the institutional and domestic long-term care setting and published as journal article in English, French or German language without any restriction of the publication year. One reviewer screens titles, abstracts and full texts and extracts data. Key characteristics and results of the included studies are charted in a tabular format. The searches will be run and continuously updated throughout the duration of the overarching FreiZeit study (every 6 months for 2 years from 2023 to 2025). Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required for this evidence map. We disseminate our findings via journal articles and conference proceedings as well as other formats.

024961c3581504f120c61625c9557d603af9d365,An overview of image processing for dental diagnosis,"Dental disease evaluation and clinical assessment are frequently accomplished through radiographic penetration. The difficulty of obtaining an accurate clinical diagnosis from radiographs rises due to the minimal mineral density change in demineralized tissue of tooth and gum disorders. Dental abnormalities may not be visible on radiographs until the demineralization is higher than 40%, according to the literature. As a result, a dental practitioner’s judgment can have a big impact on how accurately the radiography penetration depth is determined through visual inspection. To counteract this effect, image processing-based clinical diagnosis methods have become widely adopted, transforming dentistry from traditional to advance in recent years. The efforts made in the area of image processing-based digital dental diagnosis of the most challenging dental issues are outlined in the presented comprehensive literature evaluation, which also identifies any research gaps in the scope of work already done. The included studies’ quality was evaluated using Quality Assessment and Diagnostic Accuracy Tool-2 (QUADAS-2). A total of 52 out of 178 articles, published from 2012 to February 2023, were reviewed and data like image-processing approach, the size of datasets, approach results, advantages and disadvantages, name(s) of diagnosed diseases, imaging type, author, and publication year were extracted. Results show that, in 52 studies, more than 14 image-processing approaches were used on different types of radiographs for the diagnosis of a single or more than one disease by a single approach with an accuracy range from 64% to 93%. Most studies have used artificial intelligence (AI) for computer-aided diagnosis and used dental experts to label their dataset and validate the outcome of proposed methods. Efforts done by different research groups for image processing-based digital diagnosis are appreciable but still, they are lagging to meet clinically expected accuracy. There looks to be a great requirement for the development or standardization of existing methodology and it is also needed to construct standard public dental datasets to attract a greater number of research groups in the dental field.",Innovation and Emerging Technologies,2023.0,33,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1142/s2737599423300015?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1142/s2737599423300015, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The spot-welding process is widely used in many production areas, especially in the automotive industry, radiator, and wire mesh production. Spot welding in car production lines is mainly performed by robotic applications. Industry 4.0 and digital transformation trends have led to unprecedented data growth. Nowadays, the manufacturing industry benefits from the power of machine learning and data science algorithms to monitor production processes and make predictions for quality, maintenance, and production optimization. Applying machine learning algorithms reduces the duration and cost of experiments. This study aims to confirm whether the spot welding, applied by robotic arms, is within the ideal spot-welding norms, in real production area. The ideal parameter norms were evaluated by using KNN and CART machine learning algorithms. To use real production data, this study was executed in the body production assembly line, which is selected as the pilot area, at TOFAŞ factory. The data set used in this research consists of the welding parameters of the current year, 2023. By running machine learning algorithms on the dataset, the performance evaluation of each algorithm was examined and the most appropriate estimation method was determined.

abc7c61e7aa5bce901cc8f3f3d9e492f0ec820bb,"Factors influencing ambient particulate matter in Delhi, India: Insights from machine learning","Abstract Concentrations of ambient particulate matter (PM) depend on various factors including emissions of primary pollutants, meteorology and chemical transformations. New Delhi, India is the most polluted megacity in the world and routinely experiences extreme pollution episodes. As part of the Delhi Aerosol Supersite study, we measured online continuous PM1 (particulate matter of size less than 1 μm) concentrations and composition for over five years starting January 2017, using an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM). Here, we describe the development and application of machine learning models using random forest regression to estimate the concentrations, composition, sources and dynamics of PM in Delhi. These models estimate PM1 species concentrations based on meteorological parameters including ambient temperature, relative humidity, planetary boundary layer height, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, agricultural burning fire counts, solar radiation and cloud cover. We used hour of day, day of week and month of year as proxies for time-dependent emissions (e.g., emissions from traffic during rush hours). We demonstrate the applicability of these models to capture temporal variability of the PM1 species, to understand the influence of individual factors via sensitivity analyses, and to separate impacts of the COVID-19 lockdowns and associated activity restrictions from impacts of other factors. Our models provide new insights into the factors influencing ambient PM1 in New Delhi, India, demonstrating the power of machine learning models in atmospheric science applications.

dd3fc09ef6ad6821230e01916cd90e7cac490f65,The Impact of Father Involvement in the Early Childhood Problematic Behavior,"Father's involvement is something that influences the child's problematic behavior. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether father involvement can influence children's problematic behavior. This study used the systematic literature review (SLR) method by referring to 10 valid articles published in the last 10 years with the publication years between 2013 - 2023. The finding of the literature shows that there is a significant impact of father involvement on the children's problematic behavior. The more the father is involved in the children's development, the lower the level of children's problematic behavior is. The image of a father as a mentor and motivator for early childhood can still be explored in depth. Because of the limitations of this study, this study suggests that future research can further discuss the impact of the father’s involvement in the children's problematic behavior in a specific cultural aspect by considering cross-cultural factors. This is intended to conclude the relationship between the father’s interactive situations with the impact of the father’s involvement in the children's problematic behavior.

5c78eda615651f2796845c8b7ea41423e44d5120,African Rangelands and Pastoralism in a changing continent: Perspectives and Opportunities,"iii Eighty-five years ago, Africa was described as a land of promise because it provided an immense opportunity for maximum return in the minimum time (Olaniyan 2000). It was treated this way because it was considered more for its deposits of natural wealth and less for its potential for settlement or as a destination market for goods and services produced in Europe and elsewhere (Le Clair 1937). For over 50 years, this narrative held ground but in the last 20 years, perception has shifted with Africa becoming a destination market and a growth opportunity creator, whilst holding ground as a resource provider (Sy 2016). These externally driven perceptions are shifting how key natural resources on the continent are viewed, used and managed. Accordingly, contestations are emerging especially around the environmental–demographic realities. This is because of the emphasis currently placed on continuous economic growth requiring more resource inputs. This will ultimately lead to increased natural resources conflict (Abbink 2018). The exploitative narrative over Africa had become pervasive with respect to the categorisation and valuation of its natural resources. Accordingly, despite covering 43% of the continent’s land surface, rangelands have been subjected to a relatively negative narrative being described as undeveloped areas (Kratli 2010), and centers of degradation, erosion, desertification, droughts, famine and conflict (Martínez-Valderrama and Ibáñez 2023; Twinomuhangi et al. 2023). Such negative narratives influenced the kinds of intervention in rangelands, confining these large swaths of land to conservation areas such as national parks and game reserves (Jones 2006; Cavanagh et al. 2020), constraining livestock to species such as goats (Doro 2023), and expropriating lands from the Indigenous Peoples (Homewood et al. 2009; Guyo 2017). However, more recently, ecologists and economists have revisited the place of rangelands in the continent to provide alternative perspectives on the importance of these natural resources (Vetter 2013). Current evidence counteracts previous notions that African rangelands and pastoralism are unproductive and mismanaged systems (Liniger and Studer 2019). The contribution of rangelands to the livelihoods of African people is considerable and diverse. Most of the continent’s livestock providing diverse products including meat and milk produced from the rangelands (Holechek et al. 2017). Additionally, rangelands are increasingly recognised for their diverse role in the provision of ecosystem services (Ruvuga et al. 2019; Gatwaza and Wang 2023), including carbon sequestration (Denboba 2022) and other valuable provisions. As the population in Africa has grown rapidly over the last three decades and is projected to reach 2.5 billion people by 2050, food demand has also grown and will continue to rise (Dorin 2017). Rangelands have often been the frontiers for agricultural expansion and urban development, and land use conversion pressure is higher in existing rangelands, often with high population densities (Schlecht et al. 2020). Such patterns of land use change are causing inflexibility and restricting livestock mobility in traditional rangeland use centred around livestock herding (Feldt et al. 2020). Owing to these pressures, land tenure and land use policy, including land privatisation (Godde et al. 2020), sedentarisation, and conversion to other land uses, have become increasingly prevalent in the rangelands (Byakagaba et al. 2018). These changes are reorienting the livelihoods of the people domiciled in many African rangeland areas. Increasing global connections via trade and investment are leading to improved better infrastructure and increased accessibility of previously remote rangelands, thereby contributing to large-scale transformations of the traditional territories of rangeland-based people (Lind et al. 2020). Following the increasing global recognition of the momentous dynamics that are globally reshaping rangelands and biodiversity, the Government of Mongolia proposed in 2019 that the United Nations (UN) declare an International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists (IYRP) in 2026. This proposal was subsequently endorsed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and approved by the United Nations General Assembly on 15 March 2022. The intention of celebrating the IYRP is to raise the profile of rangelands and pastoral societies worldwide and to enhance recognition of their valuable contribution to the economy, environment, society, and culture at a the local, national, and global level. Under the global IYRP coalition, African researchers decided to develop a special issue of the African Journal of Range & Forage Science to provide evidence on diverse topical issues converging around the theme rangelands and pastoralism in a changing continent. This African-led special issue presents emerging evidence for a regional perspective of dynamics that are reshaping the perception, valuation, development, and management of the continent’s rangelands.",African Journal of Range &amp; Forage Science,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.2989/10220119.2023.2182070?needAccess=true&role=button', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2989/10220119.2023.2182070?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2023.2182070, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

efea8cfaae80f1000e1b4f3054cf1547afaac7e5,Insurance market transparency research trends: Bibliometric analysis,"Transparency is a fundamental necessity for the insurance market in the modern fast-changing and digital world. The study aims to establish, based on bibliometric analysis, the research trends and subject areas of the insurance market transparency, including the impact of digital technologies, regulatory initiatives, and the internal policies of insurance companies. A bibliometric analysis of papers published in the journals indexed by the Scopus database for the years 1988–2023 was conducted to achieve this goal. Five clusters have been identified based on the analysis of the shared use of keywords, demonstrating the multidisciplinary nature of the research subject. They cover government regulation and risk management; ethics; technological innovations in increasing transparency; transparency of prices and costs in health insurance; and state medical insurance transparency. The analysis of insurance market transparency trends has allowed identifying four key stages of development: post-crisis regulatory mechanisms (2013–2016), Solvency II regulation effectiveness (2017–2019), transparency during the pandemic (2020–2021), and the impact of digital innovations since 2021. Spatial clustering made it possible to identify five groups of countries whose representatives are co-authors of research on insurance market transparency. The leading countries in research on insurance market transparency are the USA, the UK, and Germany.

 Phenomics started with Mendel’s elegantly simple empirical studies. Soon after, Fisher discovered purines were rich in nuclei of all cells. A century later, we have the technology to compare the actual base pair sequence of DNA and RNA with the outward expressions of phenotypes. We have sire evaluation based on genomic and phenomic measure. But, being human, it is quite common to get immersed in exciting technology and tend to forget why we developed the technology in the first place. We only refer to ensuring a stable efficient food supply of plants and animals in the reports that we expect decision makers to read and give us more money. It is, however, truly wonderful that we now have the techniques to study the questions of the ages. But the future of phenomics is built on the foundations of the past. In 1974, A. E. Freeman and others convened a meeting under the mechanism of the newly formed Regional Research Project 2 on Defining the Inefficiency of Animal Production. From that workshop came the first modern multistate genetic study in dairy cattle with the objective to compare the phenotypes (milk component production, energy and nitrogen metabolism, hormones) of dairy animals that were born from bulls of High (+795 kg PTAM) and Low (167 kg PTAM) bulls. Please remember this study was designed in the mid 1970s and the first data collected in the early 1980s, decades before efficient methods of DNA and RNA composition were available. Studies conducted at Washington State University demonstrated marked genetic and environmental differences in adipose tissues of dairy animals. Enzymes involved with catabolic reactions were highly associated with High PTAM bulls while enzymes associated with anabolic reactions in adipose tissue were more closely related to increased energy intake regardless of genetic background. With mRNA chips, we were able, after almost 40 years, to directly relate variation in mRNA expression in the adipose tissue with the genetic background of the animals. This was the first such discovery in the field, and has led to more defined and expansive phenomics studies. In the year 2023, the use of genomics, phenomics, databases, large scale, cooperative studies and team science are specific recommendations, strategies and goals of the USDA, NIFA, The National Academies, and Land-Grant Universities. The AgBioData consortium is one example of international teams working together to expand the use of genetic and genomic databases, to prepare undergraduate and graduate level educational materials on FAIR databases and to encourage and support sustainable, robustly funded public and private partnerships in the use of integrated studies and large databases, including phenomics, with the sole purpose of expanding a robust, resilient, safe and plentiful food supply.",Journal of Animal Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/101/Supplement_3/49/52957065/skad281.061.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'other-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/jas/skad281.061?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skad281.061, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fe3f94d0b44b0bd86400f09dc20057936a10164e,Relationship between Rewarding Positive Behaviour and Disruptive Behaviour in Secondary Schools in Nairobi County Kenya,"It is estimated that about 20% of secondary school students in Kenya display challenging behaviours such as disruptiveness, non-compliance or aggression that limit their ability to learn and interfere with productive classroom instruction. Teachers use a variety of ways to manage and reduce these challenging behaviours. For instance, from the literature reviewed, it is clear that disruptive behaviour is as a result of punitive measures used in managing students’ behaviour. In these studies, it is not clear how specific behavioural management strategies influence disruptive behaviour. The aim of this study therefore, was to investigate the correlation between rewarding positive behavior; teaching alternative behavior and disruptive behaviours among form two students in Dagoretti Sub County. Specifically, the study investigated the relationship between rewarding positive behaviour and teaching alternative behaviour and disruptive behaviour. This study employed a mixed research methodology in which both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. Data was collected because the study was aimed at establishing if there was a significant relationship between behaviour support strategies and disruptive behaviours among form two students. According to Kothari (2004) quantitative research methodology focuses on numeric and detailed data that is collected using structured research instruments while qualitative methodology collects data from the respondents using narratives. Questionnaires were used to collect data on the study variables and then analysed using computer software to answer the research questions. Interview schedule was used to collect qualitative data from the guidance and counselling teachers. This research methodology was appropriate for this study because it provided an in-depth understanding of the research problem since it employs diverse approaches in data collection. The study was based on Problem Behaviour Theory. To establish the nature of the relationships among the research variables, the study employed correlational research design. This study was carried out in Dagoretti North Sub-County, Nairobi City County. The study targeted 6456 form two students, 64 form two class teachers and 32 guidance and counselling teachers in the year 2023. Purposive sampling was employed in selecting form two classes, their class teachers and guidance and counselling teachers. Students were selected using simple random sampling. The sample consisted of 365 students and 20 teachers who were sampled from 10 schools. This study primarily utilized structured questionnaires for the classroom teachers and students to collect data on Rewarding positive behaviour used by teachers and disruptive behaviour. Piloting of the research instruments involved conducting a study in one school using 20 students and two teachers. The results were used to ascertain the validity and reliability of the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze quantitative data by calculating frequencies and percentages that were presented using frequency tables. Pearson product moment correlation analysis was employed to test hypotheses. The results indicate that there was a negative and significant relationship between rewarding positive behaviour and disruptive behaviour, r (352) = – .29, p < 0.05. Since the study found that there was a negative and significant relationship between rewarding positive behaviour and disruptive behaviour among students, teachers should ensure that they come up with comprehensive guidance and counselling programs on teaching the students desirable behaviour and rewarding positive behaviour. This will go a long way in reducing disruptive behaviour among secondary school students.",International journal of research and innovation in social science,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47772/ijriss.2023.71031?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2023.71031, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Research competencies, including the skills of working with professional foreign language literature, various authentic sources, the ability to work with specialized scientific databases forms the basis of modern professional training of medical students. Aim. Description of the author's model of working with authentic foreign language materials for junior medical students and justification of the technology of organizing educational activities using specially selected authentic materials at the stage of the transition from general foreign language disciplines to professional communication. The subject of the study was the stage of transition from the general course of a foreign (English) language (GE) to a professional one (ESP). Materials and methods. The research is based on the cascade principle of the formation of foreign language competencies of medical students. This principle presupposes the systematization and practical application of general language knowledge, on the basis of which professionally significant communication skills are formed. The methods of analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, comparative studies were used, which made it possible to assess the relationship between the system of professional medical education and the use of authentic foreign language materials in this process. The empirical study was implemented by integrating professional questionnaires (needs analysis) [24] into D. Kirkpatrick's four-type model for evaluating the effectiveness of training during the transition from GE to ESP at the beginning and at the end of training. The study was conducted during one academic year (September 2022 – June 2023) in classes in the disciplines ""Foreign language (General English)"" and ""English for professional communication (ESP/EAP)"" at the Faculty of Medical Science (N. V. Sklifosovsky Institute of Clinical Medicine, Sechenov University). The respondents of the study were 80 medical students of junior courses (1st and 2nd year students) of the level of English proficiency ""Intermediate"" (B1+) and ""Upper-Intermediate"" (B2+). Results. The results of the study showed that medical students from the study group reacted positively to the introduction of professional authentic foreign language materials into the educational process. The developed model of designing educational work allowed to form and put into practice the technologies of the educational process relevant to the professional field of medicine, which increases not only the foreign language communication of students, but also their professional competencies. Conclusion. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the parameters of the developed model of the application of actual authentic materials into the educational process of professional training of medical specialists. The obtained results can be used in professional medical education, improving and improving the process of training professional personnel at the level of development of research and socially significant foreign language competencies.",Perspectives of science and education,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://pnojournalarchive3.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/pdf_230516.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32744/pse.2023.5.16?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32744/pse.2023.5.16, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Dental anxiety has a complex aetiology, making it difficult to treat with a single therapy, which is a major deterrent to getting dental care. The paediatric dentist can determine the best management options by properly evaluating the patient and determining their source and level of anxiety. Estimates of dental anxiety's prevalence may also be affected by the techniques employed to measure it. 
Aim: This systematic review and meta analysis was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of several projective dental associated anxiety measurement tools used in children as well as evaluate the many accessible dental anxiety scales. 
Methods and materials: The articles were chosen by two independent reviewers in two stages. In the first stage, each reviewer individually searched titles and abstracts according to the eligibility requirements. Articles were added to the systematic review when a third evaluator made a consensus decision in cases of disagreements. The preselected papers were subjected to full text examination by the same reviewers in phase two in order to determine eligibility and extract pertinent data. We employ the PICO framework, which compared (C) the different types of tools for measurement of anxieties like FIS, VPT, and RMS. the outcome (O) was anxiety scores in the population (P) consisting of children in the age range of 3 to 15 years, with no intervention (i) administered. For this meta-analysis, descriptive cross-sectional research were used. Two reviewers extracted the following data from the selected articles: author(s) and year of publication, design of study , objective of research, age and size of population, dental related anxiety measuring tools applied and outcome 
Results: 13 studies were ultimately chosen for comprehensive assessment. The VPT and the FIS were examined on a combined total of 295 and 293 kids, respectively. In the population under investigation, there was a computed average difference between the two tools of 0.14 (95% CI: 0.27-0.49). There was no significant variance statistically (p value = 0.76), indicating that both scales are equally accurate in determining the level of anxiety in the paediatric population. There were 209 kids evaluated for the RMS and VPT tools in total. In the population under investigation, there was a computed average difference between the two tools of 0.29 (95% CI: 0.81-0.22). Both were on par, showing that both were equally reliable (p=0.33). There were 209 kids evaluated for the RMS and VPT tools in total. In the population under investigation, there was a computed average difference between the two tools of 0.29 (95% CI: 0.81-0.22). 
Conclusion: We draw the conclusion that VPT, FIS, and RMS scales are the most often used projective measures in paediatric dentistry. These three tools are equally useful in determining how anxious kids are about visiting the dentist. The findings from this paper can be used by academics, clinicians, and psychologists to choose the best dental related anxiety evaluation system for their specific needs.

cf18618bca0897f8f4e936ee07c8c42d3f1f5339,Determinants of labor productivity in the USA,"This study aims to examine whether the labor productivity of the US population directly depends on public or private insurance coverage of people, employment level, life expectancies, spending on the public health system as a percentage of GDP, and spending on the public health system in natural terms. Empirical testing was carried out on the USА statistical data for 1987–2021 using a regression model with the fitting procedure backward stepwise selection (in Statgraphics software), and a multivariate adaptive regression spline MARS (using Salford Predictive Modeler software). The research hypothesis was confirmed for only two indicators: life expectancies and spending on the public health system in natural terms. Their impact on labor productivity appeared to be directly proportional. As an indicator, spending on the public health system has a greater impact on the change in productivity (0.0058%), whereas life expectancy has a lesser effect (0.0047%). The study showed that the MARS model provides more objective and accurate results compared to the regression model with the fitting procedure – backward stepwise selection. This conclusion is based on a comparison of real data modeled by both methods. The study proved that labor productivity in the USA grew yearly from 1987 to 2021 (the constant term in the MARS model’s regression equation is +0.48428). To calculate the specific values of labor productivity for each year, a model was developed depending on the optimal basic functions (automatically generated by the MARS model depending on the current values of life expectancies and spending on the public health system in natural terms).

8bd84723d6fdbfa300f4d5e06627372d686f7e29,Development of E-Module with STEM Nuances to Improve Students' Creative Thinking Skills,"One of the factors for improving the quality of education in schools is teaching materials. Based on the results of observations at SMAN 1 Sitiung that students have not used e-modules but use electronic teaching materials in the form of pdf files downloaded from the internet and only in the form of writing and a few pictures. Based on the results of the questionnaire, it is known that students have difficulty understanding the concept of the respiratory system material. This causes low student learning outcomes. Based on the results of the creative thinking questionnaire, it was found that students' creative thinking ability is still low with an average score of 33.8, so it is included in the less creative category. So it takes teaching materials that can help in visualizing the subject matter. This type of research is Plomp model development research which consists of three stages, namely the initial investigation stage, the development or prototyping stage, and the assessment stage. The research subjects were class XI students at SMAN 1 Sitiung for the 2022-2023 academic year. Validation results by the validator on nuanced e-modules Science Technology Engineering And Mathematics (STEM) shows an average grade 88.05% (very valid). Practical results by Biology teachers showed an average score of 87.5% (very practical) and 88.28% students (very practical). The test data for the effectiveness of creative thinking was obtained from the average essay questions 81.22% (very creative).

This study aims to determine the increase in mathematical logical intelligence of early childhood through physical activity. This is action research. This type of research was a sequential exploratory design. Data analysis in this study used a combined quantitative and qualitative analysis (Mix Method). The results showed increasing logical mathematics intelligence in DKI Jakarta's childhood. The initial assessment results showed that the average value of the child's logical mathematics intelligence was 28 and then increased to 57 in the final assessment of cycle 1 and continued to increase to 78 in the final assessment of cycle 2. Physical activity learning with games strategies increasing the logical mathematics intelligence in childhood in Jakarta Kindergarten. Future research is expected to examine more childhood intelligence with many respondents.

Pembelajaran fisika di sekolah masih menggunakan metode konvensional yang cenderung berpusat pada guru. Pengelolaan KIT di sekolah yang kurang optimal juga menjadi salah satu faktor yang melatarbelakangi penelitian ini. Melalui penerapan model pembelajaran Teaching Factory ini, diharapkan pembelajaran fisika dapat lebih melibatkan siswa secara aktif dalam pembelajaran, juga dapat menjadi alternatif solusi untuk masalah rendahnya optimalisasi KIT yang ada di sekolah. Sehingga pada akhirnya dapat meningkatkan hasil belajar siswa dalam pelajaran fisika, juga dapat mencapai tujuan pembelajaran fisika yang meliputi hasil belajar meningkat baik pada Domain proses, Domain kreativitas dan Domain sikap. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah metode kuasi eksperimen dengan desain penelitian One Group Pretest-Posttest Design. Subjek penelitian ini adalah siswa kelas X-DKV sebanyak 31 siswa sebagai kelas Eksperimen dan X-DPIB sebagai kelas Kontrol sebanyak 30 siswa di salah satu SMK Negeri 1 Buer di kabupaten Sumbawa semester ganjil tahun pelajaran 2022/2023 . Peningkatan hasil belajar siswa pada domain pengetahuan/knowledge domain diketahui dengan menghitung skor pretes dan postes. Perolehan rata-rata N-gain Score untuk pengetahuan adalah sebesar 64,36 % dengan kategori Cukup Efektif. Sedangkan profil hasil belajar siswa pada domain proses sains/process of science domain dengan rata-rata IPK sebesar 77,26 % dengan kategori terampil, profil hasil belajar pada domain kreativitas/creativity domain dengan rata-rata IPK sebesar 81,44 % dengan kategori terampil, dan profil hasil belajar pada domain sikap/attitudinal domain dengan rata-rata IPK sebesar 81,67 % dengan kategori baik.. Kata kunci: materi energy dan perubahan; model pembelajaran Teaching Factory. ABSTRACTThe research on the application of the Teaching Factory (TeFa) learning model in physics learning to improve student learning outcomes is motivated by the low student learning outcomes in physics subjects.Physics learning in schools still uses conventional methods that tend to be teacher-centered. The management of KIT in schools that is less than optimal is also one of the factors behind this research. Through the application of the Teaching Factory learning model, it is hoped that physics learning can involve students more actively in learning, and can also be an alternative solution to the problem of the low optimization of KIT in schools. So that in the end it can improve student learning outcomes in physics lessons, can also achieve physics learning goals which include increased learning outcomes both in the process domain, creativity domain and attitude domain. The research method used is a quasi-experimental method with a research design of One Group Pretest-Posttest Design.The subjects of this study were 31 students in class X-DKV as Experiment class and X-DPIB as control class as many as 30 students at one Buer State Vocational School in Sumbawa district in the odd semester of the 2022/2023 academic year. The increase in student learning outcomes in the knowledge domain is known by calculating the pretest and posttest scores. The average N-gain score for knowledge is 64.36% with the category of Quite Effective. While the profile of student learning outcomes in the domain of the process of science / process of science domain with an average GPA of 77.26% in the skilled category, the profile of learning outcomes in the domain of creativity / creativity domain with an average GPA of 81.44% in the skilled category , and the profile of learning outcomes in the attitude domain/attitudinal domain with an average GPA of 81.67 % with a good category. Keywords: energy and change material; Teaching Factory learning model.","ORBITA: Jurnal Kajian, Inovasi dan Aplikasi Pendidikan Fisika",2023.0,3,"{'url': 'http://journal.ummat.ac.id/index.php/orbita/article/download/11718/6816', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31764/orbita.v9i1.11718?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31764/orbita.v9i1.11718, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4b7475324137c3ca3ac5c34cc69d668cd2b8a8e2,Bibliometric Analysis of Research on Digital Transformation and Education,"Recent technological developments have brought about innovations in many fields, such as education, health, economy, and finance. One of these innovations is the concept of digital transformation, which changes the way businesses, institutions, and organizations do business. The concept of digital transformation began with the Fourth Industrial Revolution and brought new technologies to it. The emergence of digital technologies has revolutionized various aspects of society, including education. Digital transformation has emerged as a powerful catalyst that reshapes traditional educational practices and offers new opportunities for teaching and learning. In particular, with the Covid-19 pandemic affecting the whole world, online education has become very important, and all educational institutions have started to integrate their systems into this change. In addition, with the philosophy of lifelong learning, it has become very easy to access training on digital platforms. In line with this information, this study aims to reveal the developments in the historical process of digital transformation and education between 2000 and 2023 in the Web of Science database and to carry out bibliometric analysis by scanning the articles and books published to determine the most studied topics in the field. To achieve the aim of the study, the keywords “digital transformation and education” were scanned. As a result of this search, 2,739 publications were published. These publications were analyzed according to year, research area, country-based distribution, subject distribution, and the most used keywords. As a result of the research, when the research areas of the articles are examined, it is seen that the most studied area is ""Education and educational research"" and ""business"". This situation can be said that digital transformation is a very remarkable subject in the field of education and business. When we look at the distribution according to years, it is clear that the greatest acceleration occurred in the last five years. This shows that digital transformation has been increasingly emphasized in recent years. In terms of countries, the subject is studied more in countries such as Germany, Spain, the United States, and Russia.",Journal of Educational Technology and Online Learning,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.31681/jetol.1331297', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31681/jetol.1331297?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31681/jetol.1331297, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

923752a626319ecc2a6d9496179b80718e977b20,"Learning from young people in Gauteng, South Africa, about their experiences of depression: a discussion space report","Across the world, rising youth depression is a pressing concern that has animated researcher and popular media attention. Mostly, this attention has missed that youth depression can be prevented, provided we can discover and mobilize protective mechanisms at different systemic levels that have differential (i.e., the most impactful) value for specific youth in specific cultures and contexts. Importantly, we need to consider what combinations of protective mechanisms matter most and pay more attention to mechanisms in the systems that young people are connected to (like their families and communities). A handful of studies across a diversity of biological, social and environmental sciences are beginning to challenge the overly narrow focus on protective mechanisms at the level of the individual (Arango et al., 2021; Thapar et al., 2022). They show that a wide range of factors, like food security (Teasedale et al., 2021), less polluted or more temperate environments (Sugg et al., 2019; Theron et al., 2022), trusted social connections (Choi et al., 2020), opportunities for school and work engagement and social justice (Minh et al., 2021) matter as much, if not more, than individual resources for youth resilience to depression. Further, the Resilient Youth in Stressed Environments (RYSE) study is showing that these factors work in combination. RYSE-related work on the multisystemic determinants of the psychosocial resilience of youth living in stressed environments in Canada and South Africa (Ungar et al., 2021), has shown that at-risk youth report negligible depression symptoms when they also report greater access to a culturally relevant combination of relational, institutional and ecological resources (Theron et al., 2022). We wondered how these insights would hold up in stressed urban environments. We wanted to learn more about the intersection between multisystemic resources and young peoples’ real life experiences of mental poor health or depression in overcrowded, violent, stressed city spaces. To do this, we held a Discussion Space in Johannesburg in February 2023 to centre the voices of Black 18-24 year olds, and engage them in a participatory approach to navigate this emerging research landscape.",LIAS Working Paper Series,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://journals.le.ac.uk/ojs1/index.php/lias/article/download/4384/3703', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.29311/lwps.2023104384?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.29311/lwps.2023104384, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1cb9ccdc12f7bb8ef00c0c481ff6dd09f4e7eb3c,Analysis of trends in pedagogy and psychology: implementation of globalization solutions,"The modern development of psychology and pedagogy, which are considered as closely interconnected sciences, is characterized by the trends affected by intensive globalization processes. Therefore, the purpose of the article is to analyze these trends in order to find the applicable solutions in the field and to implement them as appropriate mechanisms for improvement of scientific and educational activities. To analyze modern pedagogy and psychology and their trends, to study the practices of implementation of global solutions we used qualitative (review of scientific and methodical literature, scientific description, interviewing, holistic analysis, description, synthesis of research results and deduction) and quantitative approaches to research (analysis of statistical data and structural analysis). The research revealed that a great number of articles concern the problems of impact of globalization phenomenon upon the educational process and social sciences paying attention towards challenges in modern pedagogy and psychology. The current literature review is based upon the analysis of 38 recent works published between 2018-2023 in internationally indexed journals. The empirical research was conducted among 36 scientific and educational professionals in Ukrainian educational institutions in the first semester of 2022-2023 academic year. The findings showed that the trends in modern pedagogy and psychology exist in general and specific pattens where general trends are typical for both fields and influence upon their transformations equally but specific trends include pattens that characterize one of these sciences and consequently create peculiar approaches. On the basis of the results of the survey, there are specific groups of solutions that can be implemented in three levels: management, organizational, and individual. The analysis of respondents’ answers and the quantitative data proved that implementation of solutions may lead to the enhancement of psychological and pedagogical science and improve the efficiency of educational process within the Ukrainian institutions.",Futurity Education,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://futurity-education.com/index.php/fed/article/download/143/89', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.57125/fed.2023.06.25.04?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.57125/fed.2023.06.25.04, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

81ba2588b26f7e4a237404bd6315d679b7641e70,EFFECTIVENESS OF PHYSICAL THERAPY AND REHABILITATION IN IMPROVING MOTOR SKILLS AND MENTAL FUNCTION IN CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY,"Cerebral palsy was first described by William John Little in 1846. There are many definitions of cerebral palsy that vary from author to author. However, we can say that cerebral palsy (CP) is a chronic non-progressive brain damage, postural and body motility disorder. Apart from sensorimotor abnormalities, some cases are accompanied by mental disorders as well as disorders of cognitive functions. It can occur during pregnancy, at birth or during the postnatal period, ie. prenatal, perinatal and postnatal - equally in both sexes. There are different classifications of cerebral palsy: according to changes in muscle tone, according to topographic features and according to the severity of the clinical picture.According to changes in muscle tone, they are divided into: Spastic form, Athetoid form, Ataxic form, Hypotonic form and Mixed form. According to the topography they are classified as: Diplegia, Quadriplegia, Hemiplegia, Triplegia and Monoplegia Physical therapy program is determined based on the clinical form of the disease. When determining a rehabilitation program, the principle of an individual approach is followed. Rehabilitation includes: physical medicine, kinesitherapy, reflex exercises according to Vojta, manual massage, thermotherapy, education of parents for rehabilitation at home; orthopedic aids; special education techniques. The aim of this study is to determine the role and impact of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in the treatment of children with Cerebral Palsy in early childhood. The research was conducted at the University of Southeast Europe - (Stul University) at the Faculty of Health Sciences in the Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, over a period of 6 months, from the beginning of April to the end of September 2023. 61 patients with cerebral palsy are included in the research, of which 28 are male, and the remaining 33 patients are female. The patients included in the research are classified into groups according to: gender, age and clinical form of cerebral palsy. The treatment of Cerebral Palsy (CP) has a complex character and includes medical, pedagogical and social rehabilitation. The individual tasks of the rehabilitation are determined after a functional examination of the motor abilities, where the main role is played by muscle tone, normal and pathological reflex motor activity, in the period up to 1 year of age. The goal of treatment with Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation is to achieve correct and timely development of movements and correction of pathological movement stereotypes (models), which occurred as a result of brain tissue damage. As for the motor deficit, kinesitherapy plays a major role. Established modern methods for kinesitherapy are the specialized methods for neuromuscular re-education of Vojta and Bobath. The Rood and Rabat methods werw also be used to facilitate the required movements and train coordination. Physical therapy and rehabilitation combined with kinesitherapy have an exceptional positive effect in: prevention of pathological primitive reflexes;creation and automation of normal active movements;saving irregular positions of the limbs and the whole body;establishment of balance and correct pattern of movement; fight against spasticity, secondary contractures and deformities; improvement of coordination and awareness of the body in relation to the environment.",MEDIS – International Journal of Medical Sciences and Research,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'http://medisij.com/index.php/mij/article/download/81/68', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.35120/medisij020423n?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.35120/medisij020423n, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

35f3d5c37ccdf670e79876257342eae8bd8c9d35,Mentoring is not “Short-Term”: effective continuing mentoring strategies for undergraduate short-term summer program participants after the research experience,"Short-term summer research experiences are a “crash-course” in unique research and mentoring opportunities. Mentoring by research faculty is a key component to short-term summer undergraduate research experiences through laboratory training, one-on-one mentoring, and overall engagement in the program. Faculty members also encourage retention of these scholars in research areas. However, continuing mentorship beyond the brevity of the experience is often difficult for both the faculty mentor and the mentee, particularly if they are at different institutions. The UAB kidney, urology, and non-malignant hematology (KUH) undergraduate research experience (KURE) has been active since 2014 and since 2018 as an NIH-funded R25 Program focused on kidney research and interdisciplinary KUH experiences. UAB KURE has trained over 99 scholars (33% underrepresented in biomedical sciences) in individualized kidney physiology and pathophysiology research as well as clinical experiences. The KURE scholars were individually matched with a faculty mentor and daily supervisors or near peers to support the project and research experience. Over 32 UAB faculty members have mentored a KURE scholar in this short-term experience with 72% (23 of 32) faculty members being a mentor for 2 or more summer experiences. Many in the UAB KURE cohorts have developed a strong bond with the mentor and KUH community at UAB. Those scholars continue in research either at a distance or in future summers, a number return as gap year interns, and many are in communication for future career direction or support. This on-going mentoring and engagement with KURE Scholars as a near peer and a faculty mentor requires time and focus. Determining the most effective means and resources to continue mentoring summer scholars in the long-term is an important consideration. Continual mentoring of summer undergraduate KURE scholars has a critical impact in retaining these scholars and increasing the diversity of researchers and clinicians in the KUH larger community. Through one-on-one qualitative interviews and quantitative survey analysis, we investigated the key aspects of ongoing mentoring of short-term research scholars. We will present methods, metrics, and models for ongoing mentoring, as well as the complex nature and significance of this ongoing mentoring after the summer experience to those scholars who are underrepresented in medicine.

51bda0e6b70b6a5c8003c0a9e1fb4a9d9787451d,Canada’s oral health and dental care inequalities and the Canadian Dental Care Plan,"It is well recognized that inequalities in all kinds of health indicators exist and that the greatest burden of disease and illness is experienced by the poorest and most marginalized groups in Canada and globally. Given that the social and commercial determinants of oral health are the same as those for other non-communicable diseases (Peres et al., 2019), it is no surprise that the same inequalities exist in oral health in Canada and elsewhere (Chari et al., 2022a) and that these have persisted over several decades (Chari et al., 2022b). However, it is important to note that, in Canada at least, inequalities in oral health and disease indicators, such as untreated dental caries or dental pain, are greater than among general health indicators (Ravaghi et al., 2013) and that the former are greater among women in Canada than among men (Canadian Academy of Health Sciences, 2014). And, unfortunately, the unequal burden of oral diseases experienced by Indigenous populations in Canada is considerable (First Nations Information Governance Centre, 2012; Health Canada, 2011). Similar to these Canadian inequalities in oral health are those in dental care, although the observations are more nuanced depending on the nature of the indicator of dental care. An analysis of self-report data on annual dental visits during the period 2001–2016 demonstrated persistent but diminishing inequalities in this outcome (Ravaghi, 2020). Nevertheless, it is important to understand that the proportion of Canadians reporting not visiting a dentist because of the cost has increased from 17% in 2007–2009 (Health Canada, 2010) to 28% in 2016 (Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey, 2016). Furthermore, in 2018, Statistics Canada reported that 36.4% of Canadians had no dental insurance (Statistics Canada, 2019) and Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) data indicate that in 2019 (i.e. the most recent “normal”, pre-pandemic year for such data), while total expenditure on dental care in Canada was $16.4 billion, only $1 billion (i.e. 6.2%) of that was publicly funded (Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2022). It is in this context that the Canadian federal government announced a new Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP; Government of Canada, 2023). More specifically, they announced an investment of $13 billion over five years with $4.4 billion ongoing to “provide dental coverage for uninsured Canadians with annual family income of less than $90,000, with no co-pays for those with family incomes under $70,000” (Government of Canada, 2023). Additionally, there will be $250 million over three years, with $75 million ongoing for an “Oral Health Access Fund” (Government of Canada, 2023). While the details of how the CDCP will work are yet to be released, it is anticipated that the large majority of spending will be in the form of fees-forservice paid to dental professionals providing care in traditional private offices. This is excellent news because cost is the major barrier to accessing dental care.

We aimed to determine the effect of online learning on assessment results in courses containing practical learning objectives delivered during the pandemic. Method: A retrospective analysis was performed on the assessment scores in courses conducted during the lockdown and on-campus years. Accumulative and objective structured practical examination scores were used as outcome measures for academic performance. Courses were categorized into pure practical, theory + practical, and pure theory. Results: This study showed that online education increased student scores as evidenced by a higher P-value in theoretical (<0.0001) than pure practical courses (0.033). Discussion.: High scores indicate the effectiveness of the implemented online learning and assessment approach. However, potential confounders, such as exam validity, reliability, and misconduct, require further investigation to ensure an optimum and legitimate learning experience in future unforeseen situations. In addition, learning gaps in complex and technical learning objectives (e.g., prepare, perform, and operate) were identified and integrated in the following academic year © 2023 Association of Medical Education in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (AMEEMR).

Moreover, the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is challenging. However, there are no organized data on the trends of pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the study area. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to fill the information gap in Central Tigray at St. Mary General Hospital between 2018 and 2023. Data were collected from the GeneXpert™ tuberculosis registration logbooks using standard checklists and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science version 22. After performing logistic regression, a p-value < 0.05 with a corresponding 95% confidence interval was considered statistically significant. Moreover, chi square test for trend was performed to assess the percentage of annual detection of pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis during the study years. Result Presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis patients with complete data (n = 3696) were included in the study. The overall prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis was 11.7%, of which 8.1% were resistant to rifampicin. The study revealed that the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis has been increasing, mainly in the recent four years. Likewise, an increase in rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed with considerable fluctuations. Age, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and presumptive rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection were significantly associated with the presence of pulmonary tuberculosis. Moreover, pulmonary tuberculosis was more prevalent among participants in the productive-age group. Conclusion Although there have been fluctuations, an increasing of pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been observed in recent years. Hence, prevention and treatment strategies for tuberculosis should be strengthened to alleviate the burden of pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the study area.","Tropical Diseases, Travel Medicine and Vaccines",2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1186/s40794-024-00224-1', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11215829, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

TIMSS assesses the mathematical and scientific knowledge and skills of students in Fourth Grade and Eighth Grade (Fourth Class and Second Year in Ireland). TIMSS is a study of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) and has been conducted every four years since 1995. TIMSS 2023 is the eighth cycle of the study and included 656,360 students from 65 countries. This national report focuses on trends in overall achievement in Ireland, as well as the distribution of achievement (performance at various percentiles), student performance at the TIMSS International Benchmarks, relative strengths and weaknesses on the TIMSS content and cognitive domains, and teachers’ reports of curriculum coverage. Performance in Ireland is explored in the context of selected countries; compared with previous cycles of TIMSS where data are available (since 2011 for Fourth Class and since 2015 for Second Year); and, where applicable, examined by gender and by socioeconomic status at both individual level and at school level (DEIS status). TIMSS 2023 also marks Ireland’s transition from paper-based to digital testing, as part of which Ireland completed a national mode effect study to examine the extent to which any differences in student achievement exist between digital and paper testing. Initial findings from this mode effect study are also presented. Finally, some conclusions and implications for policymakers in Ireland are outlined.",,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.70092/2009137.1224?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.70092/2009137.1224, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This paper aims to identify the most frequently used words/phrases in Kazakh for 2023 to be nominated for the WOTY title. The research methods include media discourse analysis and quantitative analysis using a corpus-based approach. A computer program, #LancsBox 6.0, generated a dataset—a research corpus consisting of 500 texts published on Kazakh news platforms throughout 2023. The results indicated that: 1) the conjunction “jáne” [and] had the highest frequency and occurrence in the research corpus; 2) the extracted words with high frequency indicators might serve as candidates for WOTY 2023, such as “Kazakhstan”, “jana” [new], “jyly” [year], “kerek” [need], “jumys [work]”; 3) WOTY “artificial intelligence” named by other global sources showed a high frequency indicator in Kazakh media texts.

To examine the scientific production of Small-Sided Games in soccer in the period from January 01, 2010 to February 19, 2024, through the consideration of a bibliometric study in the Web Of Science database. Methodology. To select the documents, an analysis matrix was elaborated in Microsoft Excel based on 15 categories. A review based on PRISMA recommendations was carried out in the database (Web of Science). The VOSviewer program was used to create co-occurrence maps based on keywords, co-authorship, country, institutional affiliation and journals. Results. A total of 568 documents were obtained. The results show that the greatest production is generated in research articles (92.42%). For the publication period, a systematic increase is established from the year 2018, finding that the year 2021 was the year of highest production with 84 documents. The authors with the highest production are Clemente, F.M. (10.17%), Praça, G.M. (6.25%), Sampaio, J., and Gonçalves, B. (5.53%). Regarding the area of knowledge, the one with the highest production is Sports Sciences with 398 documents (70.07%). The journal that has published the most papers and, in turn, receives the most citations (3374) is the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research (44 papers and 2141 citations). The journals with the highest number of citations are those in the Q1 quartile. The Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo is the institution with the highest number of papers (66). The prevailing language in the scientific production is English (93.66%). Conclusions. Small-Sided Games are a reason for interest in Sport Sciences, and, especially it has been studied in greater depth since 2017, with Spain and Portugal being the countries that have generated the greatest production.

97a5cc77b36fde49dd4020e5ac20abaa33aade7a,Inflight monitoring of ASO-S satellite during the year 2023,"
 Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory Satellite (ASO-S) is a space project sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences; its goal is to monitor solar activities during the 25th solar cycle. Data from ASO-S is open to all scientists who are interested in it. It is expected to collect raw scientific observations of the Sun, which probably lead to more discoveries about the Sun. As the core members of the ASO-S mission, the authors of this paper have privileged rights to handle the first-hand data from ASO-S. Based on the raw data transmitted from ASO-S, the authors focus on the orbit variation with time, quick-look products of 3 main payloads. First, the authors collect the precision orbit elements provided by the onboard GNSS receivers; with the help of professional orbit analysis software, as of Dec. 14, 2023, orbit altitude and local time of descending node are derived. Second, three quick-look products from three different payloads are derived by means of preliminary image processing techniques. Based on the above-mentioned analyses, it has shown that the orbit for ASO-S is slightly changing and stable, which has little influence on ASO-S mission operation; quick-look product quality indicates that the status of payloads is healthy, which can support ASO-S mission to run smoothly and continuously during the rest of its lifespan.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2820/1/012054', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1742-6596/2820/1/012054?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2820/1/012054, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It used a qualitative descriptive design with inductive analysis, which uses descriptive data in written or oral words. The researcher used the non-probability sampling technique to get deeper data. The participants are 35 students of the eleventh-grade science class of MA Matholibul Huda Jepara. The researcher used interviews and documentation to collect the data. To analyze the obtained data, the researchers used coding. Researchers compare different codes, and several codes are combined into one because of the emergence of a similarity. The study's results found that the motivation and engagement aspects of learning reading through the Wattpad application highlight the platform's potential to foster a positive reading culture among students. Teachers can better understand how Wattpad influences students' reading habits, interests, and engagement with literature. The improvement in reading aspects provides a comprehensive view of the various dimensions of reading skill improvement. The variety of content in learning reading emphasizes the platform's ability to cater to diverse interests and reading preferences. The positive influence and reading habits for learning reading foster a love for reading and develop consistent reading practices among students.

As we embark on this journey, we al-so celebrate a significant milestone – the fifteenth anniversary of the European Journal of Geography. Over the past decade and a half, our journal has become a beacon of excellence in the field of geography and the social sciences. This journey has been characterised by unwavering commitment and tireless dedication, a collective endeavour led by the dedicated members of our editorial team and the European Association of Geographers (EUROGEO). Their diligence and passion have been instrumental in making our journal the respected publication it is today. Looking back on our shared history, we are proud to have published over 310 articles dealing with key topics in geography, planning and development. These scholarly contributions have not only explored and analysed important topics, but have also introduced new ideas (Kout-sopoulos, 2022; Manetos et al., 2022), methods (Cramer-Greenbaum, 2023; Krevs et al., 2023; Morawski & Wolff-Seidel, 2023) and data (Hojati & Mokarram, 2016) that will inspire future generations of geographers to transcend conventional disciplinary boundaries. The richness of our content encompasses numerous facets and includes the fields of geography education (Fraile-Jurado & Periáñez-Cuevas, 2023; Humble, 2023; Martínez-Hernández et al., 2023; Mašterová, 2023; Puertas-Aguilar et al., 2023), physical geography (Sánchez-Martínez & Cabrera, 2015), sustainability (Leininger-Frézal et al., 2023; Mally, 2021), tourism (Bandt et al., 2022; Jovanovic et al., 2022), geoin-formatics (Batsaris et al., 2023; Vestena et al., 2023), spatial analysis (Agourogiannis et al., 2021; Bartzokas-Tsiompras & Photis, 2020b; Wieland, 2022), remote sensing (Younes et al., 2023), maps (Nedkov et al., 2018; Papaioannou et al., 2020), geoinformation (Bartha & Kocsis, 2011; Bart-zokas-Tsiompras, 2022), economic (Doukissas et al., 2020; Mikhaylova, 2018), social (Mei & Liempt, 2022; Roșu et al., 2015), political (Kevicky, 2023; Tsitsaraki & Petracou, 2023) and cultural (Gusman & Otero-Varela, 2023) geography, geopolitics (Morgado, 2023) as well as environmental (Burić et al., 2023; Prodanova & Varadzhakova, 2022), urban (Chondrogianni & Stephanedes, 2021; Lagarias et al., 2022) and transport (Garrido, 2013; Kellerman, 2023; Koktavá & Horák, 2023) geography/planning (González, 2017). Each article, a testament to the diversity and depth of knowledge within our community, has played a crucial role in energising discourse in our academic environment. Several EJG articles addressed current global crises and challenges such as climate change, COVID-19, wars and economic recession. They show how important geography is when it comes to finding solutions and new insights to the many problems that threaten our world. This interconnected approach underlines the journal's commitment to engaging with both the specialised academic discourse and the broader global challenges of our time.

d8fddc6b49ad642281158d52c0f43615f5feee7d,A 10-year bibliometric analysis in the field of osteosarcoma treatment from 2014 to 2023,"Objective This paper aims to explore the research hot spot and development trend in osteosarcoma treatment using a bibliometric method based upon Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) platform over the last decade. Methods The literature related to osteosarcoma and cure which were published from January 2014 to December 2023 were retrieved from the database of WoSCC and made an overall analysis for the papers published including number of articles, distribution of countries and institutions, author information, and keywords, with the CiteSpace 6.2.R5. Results A total of 3131 papers were retrieved, including 2601 articles and 530 reviews, and the number of papers published has been increasing year by year in the last decade. There were 415 countries and 10,719 research institutions participating into the study. China’s output of literature was the highest relying on its 1490 papers published, followed by The United States (548 papers). Shanghai Jiaotong university had the largest number of papers published (121 papers) and Central South University ranked second (82 papers). A total of 16,816 authors participated in the study. The number of the paper published by Massimo Serra of the Rizzoli Orthopaedics Institute was the largest (27 papers), followed by Dominique Heymann of the University of Sheffield (20 papers). The visualization analysis of keywords by CiteSpace software showed that the drug resistance, drug delivery, tumor tissue engineering and gene expression have become hotspots in the field of osteosarcoma treatment. Drug resistance significantly limits the effectiveness of current cancer treatments. Drug delivery technology not only enhances the targeting and efficacy of drugs but also helps to overcome drug resistance. The stem cells, targeted therapy, and tumor microenvironment represent the new research trends. In particular, the tumor microenvironment plays a key role in tumor development, progression, and drug resistance, and it offers numerous potential therapeutic targets. Conclusion Our investigation has identified key research foci and hotspots in osteosarcoma treatment, including drug resistance mechanisms, innovations in drug delivery technology, stem cell development, tumor microenvironment analysis, the development of novel therapies, and the clinical translation of tumor tissue engineering.

Despite rising CRC incidence rates in the Arab world, understanding of trends and patterns in CRC screening research remains limited. This study addresses this gap through a bibliometric analysis of CRC screening research in the Arab world from 2007 to 2023. We conducted an extensive literature search in Web of Science and Scopus databases, analyzing 124 articles using the Bibliometrix Package in R. Our findings revealed a 16.5% annual growth in research output, with significant increases from 2014 onwards. Saudi Arabia led in scientific production, followed by Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, while Qatar had the highest country production when adjusted for population size. Disparities in research output relative to the CRC burden were evident, especially in lower-resource countries. Three regional clusters were identified: Saudi Arabia, with strong collaborations with Canada and Egypt; a second cluster including Lebanon, UAE, Jordan, Qatar, Iraq, and Oman; and a third cluster featuring Morocco, with significant collaboration with France. Thematic analysis showed a focus on CRC screening awareness, barriers, and adherence but a lack of studies on implementation strategies and cost-effectiveness.

cea9f8a59db96d26fb2943740c034a3468ce3954,Digital Age Transformation in Patient-Physician Communication: 25-Year Narrative Review (1999-2023),"Background The evolution of patient-physician communication has changed since the emergence of the World Wide Web. Health information technology (health IT) has become an influential tool, providing patients with access to a breadth of health information electronically. While such information has greatly facilitated communication between patients and physicians, it has also led to information overload and the potential for spreading misinformation. This could potentially result in suboptimal health care outcomes for patients. In the digital age, effectively integrating health IT with patient empowerment, strong patient-physician relationships, and shared decision-making could be increasingly important for health communication and reduce these risks. Objective This review aims to identify key factors in health communication and demonstrate how essential elements in the communication model, such as health IT, patient empowerment, and shared decision-making, can be utilized to optimize patient-physician communication and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes in the digital age. Methods Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and IEEE Xplore were searched using keywords related to patient empowerment, health IT, shared decision-making, patient-physician relationship, and health communication for studies published between 1999 and 2023. The data were constrained by a modified query using a multidatabase search strategy. The screening process was supported by the web-based software tool Rayyan. The review methodology involved carefully designed steps to provide a comprehensive summary of existing research. Topic modeling, trend analysis, and synthesis were applied to analyze and evaluate topics, trends, and gaps in health communication. Results From a total of 389 selected studies, topic modeling analysis identified 3 primary topics: (1) Patient-Physician Relationship and Shared Decision-Making, (2) Patient Empowerment and Education Strategies, and (3) Health Care Systems and Health IT Implementations. Trend analysis further indicated their frequency and prominence in health communication from 1999 to 2023. Detailed examinations were conducted using secondary terms, including trust, health IT, patient-physician relationship, and patient empowerment, derived from the main topics. These terms clarified the collective impact on improving health communication dynamics. The synthesis of the role of health IT in health communication models underscores its critical role in shaping patient-centered health care frameworks. Conclusions This review highlights the significant contributions of key topics that should be thoroughly investigated and integrated into health communication models in the digital age. While health IT plays an essential role in promoting shared decision-making and patient empowerment, challenges such as usability, privacy concerns, and digital literacy remain significant barriers. Future research should prioritize evaluating these key themes and addressing the challenges associated with health IT in health communication models. Additionally, exploring how emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, can support these goals may provide valuable insights for enhancing health communication.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2024.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11783030, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is impossible not to take into account that information technologies are an independent discipline, a means through which the transformation of school and university education has been taking place in recent decades. The content of informatics at school and university should to a certain extent correspond to the level of science development and the requirements of society. The variety of digital tools and the ubiquitous availability of information create huge opportunities for their creative use within their discipline, related natural science subjects, and in various other spheres of human activity. Based on a comparative analysis, the article draws conclusions about the problems faced by both domestic and foreign specialists in the field of education. The article analyzes the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and problems of the school and university education systems in Russia and abroad, and considers their relationship. It is substantiated that the lack of consistency and discreteness in the process of teaching computer science and information technology at school lead to a discrepancy between the training of school graduates and the requirements for the basic knowledge of first-year university students. The article presents the results of the analysis of basic curricula at school (in the field of computer science) and curricula in the preparation of future computer science teachers at the university (using the Transbaikal State University as an example). The authors analyze the results of diagnostic testing, which was conducted with first-year students of the Transbaikal State University in September 2023/2024, in order to monitor their existing knowledge and skills in the field of computer science. The article suggests ways to solve the problem of secondary school – higher education institution continuity in the field of computer science.

d5389de5b507970621e2ce9aed8b5e2ba24cc393,Mapping global trends and future opportunities in Islamic banking windows: a 15-year bibliometric perspective (2008–2023),"Purpose
Islamic banking windows have attracted a considerable deal of scholarly attention lately, as shown by the sharp rise in publications across the globe. The growing number of Islamic banking windows being published demonstrates how much scholarly interest there has been in this topic. To evaluate the body of knowledge on Islamic banking windows, this paper aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis.

Design/methodology/approach
A bibliometric examination of literature samples pulled in July 2023 from the Scopus database served as the study’s methodology. In total, 79 publications that met the criteria for selection and were published between 2008 and 2023 made up the study’s sample size. Software like RStudio (Rshiny), VOSviewer and Microsoft Excel have been used to evaluate the data. Three major kinds of analyses were carried out: overall performance indicators, citation analysis and cross-dimensional keyword analysis. A quick content analysis to pinpoint research flows then followed.

Findings
The number of publications increased noticeably between 2019 and 2021, with Abdul Majid M. contributing the most with four articles published during that time. The findings also include the countries, groups, publications, works, sources and topics that have contributed the most. This examination found five research streams that have already been examined by other writers out of 79 papers. Comparative efficiency, Islamic banking’s customer, performance, risk and liquidity management are some of the research areas covered. With precise research questions, this study further outlined the future research agenda.

Research limitations/implications
The scope of this study is restricted to English-language journal articles appearing in sources that are Scopus-indexed. A variety of databases, including Dimensions and the Web of Science, as well as expanding the investigated units, could be used in future research. Future studies might center on the systematic review of publications published on certain topics, whereas this study only focused on bibliometric analysis and research streams.

Originality/value
Despite the fact that Islamic banking is a fascinating topic for research, as far as the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first bibliometric analysis of Islamic banking windows. The five research streams identified in this study also offer numerous potential research topics in a unique way.

 102
 
 
 Background:
 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the United States and the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality. In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) lowered the age of initial CRC screening from 50 to 45 years of age for average risk individuals. At that time, only 20% of adults aged 45-49 years were up-to-date with CRC screening. With its at-home use, accessibility, and patient navigation, the multi-target stool DNA test (mt-sDNA) could help support screening uptake in this population. Here, we analyzed national claims data to investigate mt-sDNA adherence rates among average-risk adults aged 45-50 years.
 Methods:
 Using a national claims database of over 165 million individuals linked with Exact Sciences Laboratories data, mt-sDNA orders for AA patients were retrospectively identified from 2017 to 2023. Average CRC risk individuals aged ≥45 years, and new to mt-sDNA, were included in this analysis. Primary outcome of interest was adherence, defined as mt-sDNA kit return rate within 365-days from shipment. Test return time was examined as the secondary outcome. Demographics were age, sex, ordering provider, residential geography, payor, and outreach preference. Covariates on adherence were examined using logistic regression.
 Results:
 A total of 607,388 mt-sDNA orders were prescribed during the study period, with an overall 365-day return rate of 65.4%. Average time to test return was 30.4 days. Women outnumbered men in the cohort (58.6%), and most mt-sDNA orders were prescribed by primary care providers (59.4%). The majority of individuals preferred ‘Digital SMS’ communication (62%), and nearly 90% of the cohort was Commercially insured (87.6%). Among those in the cohort participants’ self-reported race/ethnicity was: White (37.3%), Hispanic or Latino (10.1%), Black or African American (8.8%), unknown (8.8%), Asian or pacific islander (4.6%), and other (3.7%). Adherences for the four identified races/ethnicities were all near, or above 60%. Men demonstrated higher adherence than women (66.7% vs 64.5%; p<0.0001). Time to test return was shortest in men (28.9 days) and African American persons (28.5 days). Tests ordered by gastroenterologists yielded the quickest adherence times amongst providers (26 days). After controlling for race, gender, payor class, setting (urban/rural classification), and preferred language, digital outreach and provider type were significantly associated with increased mt-sDNA adherence.
 Conclusions:
 This large, national analysis reports a substantially higher rate of adherence among individuals ages 45-49 with the mt-sDNA test than the current nationally reported rates. At-home testing, along with standard and preference-based navigation may have contributed to high mt-sDNA completion rates. More research is warranted to explore screening behaviors and the benefits of screening within this younger population.

Thus, this quantitative research aimed to determine the mediating role of science motivation on the relationship between computer literacy and the academic performance of Grade 6 learners during the academic year 2023-2024. Modified and adapted survey questionnaires from the Department of Education Computerization Program (DCP), Cagayan State University – Andrews Campus, and Glynn (2011), using a 5-point Likert scale, were employed for data collection. Analysis involved mean, two-way ANOVA, and path analysis. Results showed that the Grade 6 learners exhibited a high level of computer literacy in terms of computer integration (mean=3.78). The academic performance of Grade 6 learners indicated a very high level in terms of student-related factors (mean=4.3). Concurrently, Grade six learners are often more extrinsically motivated (mean=4.09). Significant indirect relationship was shown between computer literacy and academic performance through science motivation. Significant direct relationship was also shown between computer literacy and academic performance. The total effect estimates of 0.531 (SE = 0.0804, Z = 6.61, p < 0.001) suggests that there is a significant overall relationship between computer literacy and academic performance, regardless of the mediating effect of science motivation.

8d6f700bea4dabd85dfef6951b665699f4380850,A bibliometrics analysis based on the application of artificial intelligence in the field of radiotherapy from 2003 to 2023,"Background Recent research has demonstrated that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiotherapy (RT) has significantly streamlined the process for physicians to treat patients with tumors; however, bibliometric studies examining the correlation between AI and RT are not available. Providing a thorough overview of the knowledge structure and research hotspots between AI and RT was the main goal of the current study. Method A search was conducted on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database for publications pertaining to AI and RT between 2003 and 2023. VOSviewers, CiteSpace, and the R program “bibliometrix” were used to do the bibliometric analysis. Results The analysis comprised 615 publications from 64 countries, with USA and China leading the pack. Since 2017, there have been more and more publications about RT and AI every year. The research center that made the biggest contribution to this topic was Maastricht University. The most articles published journal in this field was Frontiers in Oncology, while Medical Physics received the greatest number of citations. Dekker Andre is the author with the greatest number of published articles, while Philippe Lambin was the most often co-cited author. In the newly identified research hotspots, “autocontouring algorithm”, “deep learning”, and “machine learning” stand out as the main terms. Conclusion In fact, our bibliometric analysis offers insightful information on current research directions and advancements pertaining to the use of AI in RT. For academics looking to understand the connection between AI and RT, this study is a great resource because it highlights current research frontiers and hot trends.

eecf2c16bfe3cafb3ee88ffb32ed5a97e0f227b9,Indicators of Global Climate Change 2023: annual update of key indicators of the state of the climate system and human influence,"Abstract. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5–10 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles. We follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open-data, open-science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel. The indicators show that, for the 2014–2023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] °C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] °C was human-induced. For the single-year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] °C in 2023 relative to 1850–1900. The best estimate is below the 2023-observed warming record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] °C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2–0.4] °C per decade over 2014–2023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of net greenhouse gas emissions being at a persistent high of 53±5.4 Gt CO2e yr−1 over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.

96fadc4ddd40a27804a21266a1077273f52dbf03,Institutional Economics in the Mirror of 2023 Publications,"Bibliographic studies of scientific publications have become popular nowadays. This paper attempts to answer the question – what is happening with institutional economics in Russia. The empirical base is data from the scientific electronic library Elibrary.ru on articles of 2023. At the first stage of the study, a selection of journals was carried out (76 in total). The selection criterion was belonging to Q1 of the Higher Attestation Commission list and inclusion in the top 100 journals according to the Science Index rating (Economics, Economic Sciences). The selected journals are characterised by their founders, place of publication and year of foundation. It is revealed that institutional economics is mentioned in the editorial policy of nine journals. At the second stage, we selected articles published in 76 journals by the presence of the terms ""institution"" and ""institutional"" in their titles and keywords (a total of 191 articles). We found a rather high concentration of these articles in the core of journals whose editorial policy either mentions institutional issues or whose thematic orientation is extremely broad. At the third stage, articles were sorted by annotations and keywords by expert means, and publications related to economic institutionalism (96 in total) were singled out. The distribution of these articles across journals and affiliations is shown, and the characteristics of co-authorship and collaborations are identified. The metadata of the articles was then used to conduct a content analysis of the nature and thematic focus of the articles, the data and methods used, and the terminology of the research. To better understand the nature of the research being conducted, the content analysis was supplemented by reviewing the content of the articles. The analysis made it possible to draw a conclusion about the predominance of empirical studies. Among theoretical articles there is an orientation towards the formation of original author's concepts on the basis of ""synthesis"" and ""interdisciplinarity"", as well as the so-called ""conceptual creativity"". In a significant part of empirical works the elaboration of theoretical foundations of research is insufficient.",Journal of Institutional Studies,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.17835/2076-6297.2024.16.4.006-023', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17835/2076-6297.2024.16.4.006-023?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17835/2076-6297.2024.16.4.006-023, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c0ffd1ad2618b90c979f79261e4249cb25869b61,Resveratrol’s bibliometric and visual analysis from 2014 to 2023,"Introduction Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural polyphenolic compound derived from a variety of plants that possesses a wide range of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-aging, anti-radiation damage, anti-apoptosis, immune modulation, regulation of glucolipid metabolism, inhibition of lipid deposition, and anti-neuro. It is therefore considered a promising drug with the potential to treat a wide range of diseases. Method In this study, using Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) and CiteSpace bibliometric tool, VOSviewer quantitatively visualized the number of countries, number of authors, number of institutions, number of publications, keywords, and references of 16,934 resveratrol-related papers from 2014–2023 for quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results The results showed that an average of 1693.4 papers were published per year, with a general upward trend. China had the most publications with 5877. China Medical University was the institution with the largest number of publications and the highest number of citations in the field. The research team was mainly led by Prof. Richard Tristan, and the journal with the highest number of published papers was Molecular. Dietary polyphenols, oxidative stress, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects are the most frequently cited articles. Oxidative stress, apoptosis, expression, and other keywords play an important role in connecting other branches of the field. Discussion Our analysis indicates that the integration of nanoparticles with RSV is poised to become a significant trend. RSV markedly inhibits harmful bacteria, fosters the proliferation of beneficial bacteria, and enhances the diversity of the intestinal flora, thereby preventing intestinal flora dysbiosis. Additionally, RSV exhibits both antibacterial and antiviral properties. It also promotes osteogenesis and serves a neuroprotective function in models of Alzheimer's disease. The potential applications of RSV in medicine and healthcare are vast. A future research challenge lies in modifying its structure to develop RSV derivatives with superior biological activity and bioavailability. In the coming years, innovative pharmaceutical formulations of RSV, including oral, injectable, and topical preparations, may be developed to enhance its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy.",Frontiers in Plant Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2024.1423323', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11493714, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9a7420817a290cf8cf956b36ff87504be502c579,Two Decades of Project-Based Learning in Engineering Education: A 21-Year Meta-Analysis,"The implementation of project-based learning (PjBL) has contributed to improving students’ learning outcomes. However, strong evidence specifically linking PjBL to the improvement of students' higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) is still limited, especially in engineering education. Hence, this study aims to uncover the impact of PjBL on students' HOTS through a meta-analysis. A total of 16 studies were sourced from ACM, Dimensions, IEEE, Science Direct, Scopus, and WOB metadata, with a search time ranging from 2003 to 2023. Data sourced from relevant literature were analyzed using a random-effects hedge model in JASP software. The results showed that the application of PjBL had a significant impact, rRE (0.315), or 31.5% on students' HOTS in the context of engineering education. Furthermore, there was no publication bias in the analysis of the studies. Meanwhile, the review of moderator variables showed that PjBL is most frequently implemented in Eastern cultures, particularly in computer science subjects, and the most common method for measuring skills is through test scores. Generally, the integration of PjBL into the learning process could effectively improve students’ HOTS.",TEM Journal,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.temjournal.com/content/134/TEMJournalNovember2024_3514_3525.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18421/tem134-84?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18421/tem134-84, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In response to this situation, in order to support the achievement of the strategic development goal, an order for the development of higher education and science in the Republic of Kazakhstan has been implemented with the aim of gradually increasing investment in scientific research to 1% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Our assessment of the scientific output of veterinary sciences in Kazakhstan over the five-year period 2018–2023 demonstrated progress. The total investment in veterinary science has increased to 14 billion KZT, i.e., from 2018, the funding of projects has become annual, previously it was once every 3 years. The consequence of this transformation was a 5-fold increase in the number of published articles for example, in 2022–2023 their number reached 50 compared to 2018–2019, where the number was barely 10. Despite the positive trend in veterinary science in recent years there are still gaps in the form of inadequate funding (only 20 funded projects per year with an average allocation of <200,000 USD per project), the productivity of the scientific community has been lower than expected: 91 peer-reviewed publications were published in first quartile journals over 5 years, which is an average of one publication in first quartile journals per year for every 32 PhD researchers (with a total of 584 PhDs), concentration of science only in large cities of Kazakhstan (Astana, Almaty), scientific developments of scientists are not commercialized and have no feedback with production.

CT was reported to have the largest demand in oncology (24%), followed by neurology (16.5%) and hepatobiliary (14%) use. Applications for CT continue to expand to new clinical indications and therapeutic areas.
Five hundred and sixty CT units were identified by the CMII in its 2022–2023 national survey, with all provinces and territories reporting CT capacity. Most sites are publicly funded hospitals located in urban settings.
Canada has an average of 14 CT units per million people. The greatest density of units per million people is in Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut.
Canada is positioned in the bottom 15% of OECD countries in units per million population and the top 45% of OECD countries for average volume of publicly funded CT exams per1,000 population.
Approximately 6.4 million publicly funded CT examinations were performed in the 2022–2023 fiscal year. This represents a national average of 160.2 exams per 1,000 people, an increase of 9% since 2015.
The average age of CT equipment in Canada is 8.2 years; 29.8% of CT units are 5 years old or newer, 36.7% are 6 to 10 years old, and 33.4% are more than 10 years old.
The adoption and use of radiation safety strategies are increasing in Canada. An increasing number of CT units are now equipped with dose-management controls and patient dose recording features. Approximately 30% of CT units are reported to have dual-target imaging.
CT units operate an average of 14 hours per day. Approximately 80% of sites reported CT operation on weekends and 40% of sites reported CT operation 24 hours a day.

If left untreated, almost all eyes could lose a significant portion of their vision within four months. There is limited evidence regarding the magnitude of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and associated factors in the study setting and also in Ethiopia. Purpose To determine the magnitude and associated factors of proliferative diabetic retinopathy among adult diabetic patients attending Specialized Comprehensive Hospital-Diabetic Care Clinics in Northwest Ethiopia, 2023. Methods A multicenter, hospital-based, cross-sectional study was conducted on 1219 adult diabetic patients selected by systematic random sampling technique. Data were collected through an in-person interview and physical examination. The Statistical Package for Social Science Version 20 was used to analyze the data. Logistic regression methods were used to test the association between predisposing factors and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to determine the strength of association. Results The prevalence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 3.1% (95% CI: 2.10%-4.10%). Hypertension (AOR = 4.35 (95% CI: 1.87–10.12)), peripheral neuropathy (AOR = 3.87 (95% CI: 1.57–9.54)), nephropathy (AOR = 2.58 (95% CI: 1.13–5.87)), ≥10 years duration of diabetes mellitus (AOR = 5.30 (95% CI: 2.32–12.14)), insulin use (AOR = 3.07 (95% CI: 1.08–8.68)), and poor adherence to diabetes mellitus medications (AOR = 3.77 (95% CI: 1.64–8.64)) were confirmed to have statistically significant association with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Conclusion The prevalence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy among adult diabetic patients in the diabetes clinic was higher than the global study.

da903b8a3693df85eea5003a7dc2be228c208e8c,Comprehensive characterization of intracranial hemorrhage in deep brain stimulation: a systematic review of literature from 1987 to 2023.,"OBJECTIVE
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for medically refractory movement disorders and other neurological conditions. To comprehensively characterize the prevalence, locations, timing of detection, clinical effects, and risk factors of DBS-related intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), the authors performed a systematic review of the published literature.


METHODS
PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched using 2 concepts: cerebral hemorrhage and brain stimulation, with filters for English, human studies, and publication dates 1980-2023. The inclusion criteria were the use of DBS intervention for any human neurological condition, with documentation of hemorrhagic complications by location and clinical effect. Studies with non-DBS interventions, no documentation of hemorrhage outcome, patient cohorts of ≤ 10, and pediatric patients were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. The authors performed proportional meta-analysis for ICH prevalence.


RESULTS
A total of 63 studies, with 13,056 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of ICH was 2.9% (fixed-effects model, 95% CI 2.62%-3.2%) per patient and 1.6% (random-effects model, 95% CI 1.34%-1.87%) per DBS lead, with 49.6% being symptomatic. The ICH rates did not change with time. ICH most commonly occurred around the DBS lead, with 16% at the entry point, 31% along the track, and 7% at the target. Microelectrode recording (MER) during DBS was associated with increased ICH rate compared to DBS without MER (3.5 ± 2.2 vs 2.1 ± 1.4; p[T ≤ t] 1-tail = 0.038). Other reported ICH risk factors include intraoperative systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg, sulcal DBS trajectories, and multiple microelectrode insertions. Sixty percent of ICH was detected at 24 hours postoperatively and 27% intraoperatively. The all-cause mortality rate of DBS was 0.4%, with ICH accounting for 22% of deaths. Single-surgeon DBS experience showed a weak inverse correlation (r = -0.27, p = 0.2189) between the rate of ICH per lead and the number of leads implanted per year.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides level III evidence that MER during DBS is a risk factor for ICH. Other risk factors include intraoperative systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg, sulcal trajectories, and multiple microelectrode insertions. Avoidance of these risk factors may decrease the rate of ICH.",Journal of Neurosurgery,2024.0,5,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3171/2024.1.JNS232385?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3171/2024.1.JNS232385, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

SR is applied frequently across a variety of medical imaging contexts, particularly in the enhancement of neuroimaging, with specific techniques including SR microscopy—used for diagnostic biomarkers—and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)—a neuroimaging method for the measurement and mapping of brain activity. This bibliometric analysis of the literature related to SR in medical imaging was conducted to identify the global trends in this field, and visualization via graphs was completed to offer insights into future research prospects. Methods In order to perform a bibliometric analysis of the SR literature, this study sourced all publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database published from January 1, 2000, to October 11, 2023. A total of 3,262 articles on SR in medical imaging were evaluated. VOSviewer was used to perform co-occurrence and co-authorship analysis, and network visualization of the literature data, including author, journal, publication year, institution, and keywords, was completed. Results From 2000 to 2023, the annual publication volume surged from 13 to 366. The top three journals in this field in terms of publication volume were as follows: (I) Scientific Reports (86 publications), (II) IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (74 publications), and (III) IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control (56 publications). The most prolific country, institution, and author were the United States (1,017 publications; 31,301 citations), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (124 publications; 2,758 citations), and Dinggang Shen (20 publications; 671 citations), respectively. A cluster analysis of the top 100 keywords was conducted, which revealed the presence of five co-occurrence clusters: (I) SR and artificial intelligence (AI) for medical image enhancement, (II) SR and inverse problem processing concepts for positron emission tomography (PET) image processing, (III) SR ultrasound through microbubbles, (IV) SR microscopy for Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, and (V) SR in brain fMRI: rapid acquisition and precise imaging. The most recent high-frequency keywords were deep learning (DL), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

No previous study conducted a bibliometric analysis of the corpus of pediatric spine surgery. We used big data and advanced bibliometric analyses to evaluate trends in the progression of pediatric spine surgery as a distinct field since the beginning of the 20th century. METHODS: A Web of Science query was designed to capture the representative corpus of pediatric spine literature. Statistical and bibliometric analyses were performed using various Python packages and the Bibliometrix R package. RESULTS: The collection, published from 1902 to 2023, comprised a total of 11 861 articles from 61 journals and 32 715 unique authors. The overall growth rate annually for publications was 5.08%. An upsurge in publications was seen in the 1980s, after the advent of specialty and subspecialty journals. Illustratively, over 90% of all articles pertaining to pediatric spine surgery were published in the past 3 decades. International and domestic collaboration also increased exponentially over this time period. Reference publication year spectroscopy allowed us to identify 75 articles that comprise the historical roots of modern pediatric spine surgery. There was a recent lexical evolution of topics and terms toward alignment, outcomes, and patient-centric terms. Coauthorship among under-represented groups increased since 1990, but remains low, with disparities persisting across journals. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive bibliometric analysis on the corpus of pediatric spine surgery offers insight into the evolving landscape of research, authorship, and publication trends over the past century. Advancements in the understanding of the natural history and technology have led the field to become increasingly outcomes focused, all of which have been fueled by pioneering authors.

3a8b47c90ae85f89dc76c49dd0aa79a298f3c29c,Bibliometric analysis of bone metastases from lung cancer research from 2004 to 2023,"Background Bone metastases of lung cancer (BMLC) severely diminish patients’ quality of life due to bone-related events, and the lack of clear guidelines globally regarding medical and surgical treatment significantly reduces patient survival. While knowledge about BMLC has grown exponentially over the past two decades, a comprehensive and objective bibliometric analysis remains absent. Methods A comprehensive bibliometric analysis was conducted on relevant literature on BMLC extracted from the Web of Science database from 2004 to 2023 by Biblioshiny, VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, CiteSpace, and Microsoft Office Excel Professional Plus 2016 software. 936 papers related to BMLC were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). The number of publications, countries, institutions, global collaborations, authors, journals, keywords, thematic trends, and cited references were then visualized. Finally, the research status and development direction in the last 20 years were analyzed. Results This study included a total of 936 papers on BMLC from 2004 to 2023. There has been a steady increase in global publications each year, peaking in 2021. China had the highest number of publications, followed by Japan and the United States. Additionally, China had the most citations with an H-index of 35, while the US followed with an H-index of 34, highlighting their significant contributions to the field. “Frontiers in Oncology” had the highest number of publications. CiteSpace analysis identified “lung cancer,” “bone metastasis,” and “survival” as the top high-frequency keywords, encapsulating the core research focus. Keyword clustering analysis revealed six main clusters representing the primary research directions. Burst analysis of keywords showed that “skeletal complications” had the highest burst intensity from 2005 to 2013, while recent research trends include “immunotherapy” and “denosumab,” with bursts from 2021 to 2023. Trend topic analysis indicated that “non-small cell lung cancer,” “immunotherapy,” and “immune checkpoint inhibitors” represent the cutting-edge research directions in this field. Conclusion This article reveals the current status and trend of research on BMLC, which is increasing worldwide.

We saw new highs of greenhouse gas emissions, temperature records tumbling and climate impacts arriving stronger and faster. The finance to help vulnerable communities adapt to climate change isn’t being delivered. At the same time, most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are off track at the halfway point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. There are many reasons for this, but it is clear that slow action on the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste is a major driving force. This is the downside. The upside is that the global response to the triple planetary crisis intensified. Efforts to combat pollution and waste received a shot in the arm with the agreement of the Global Framework on Chemicals and progress on the global instrument on plastic pollution, which should be ready by 2024. Nations adopted a treaty to protect biodiversity in the ocean beyond national borders, while key guidelines to help the private sector reduce its impact on nature were released – a boost to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, the implementation of which gathered pace. Finally, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP28, delivered a clear call on countries to transition away from fossil fuels – alongside a framework on the Global Goal on Adaptation, operationalizing the Loss and Damage Fund, and new commitments on sustainable cooling, methane reduction, tripling renewable energy targets and nature breakthroughs. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) played an important role in many of these processes – by providing key science and solutions on the triple planetary crisis, convening and supporting important negotiations, hosting critical multilateral environmental agreements, working with the private and financial sectors to align funding with global processes and supporting Member States to deliver on their commitments.",,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://wedocs.unep.org/xmlui/bitstream/20.500.11822/44777/20/UNEP_Annual_Report_2023_French.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.59117/20.500.11822/44777?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.59117/20.500.11822/44777, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We held a conference to (1) define precision EM, (2) develop an evidence-based research agenda, and (3) identify educational gaps for current and future EM clinicians. Nine preconference workgroups (biomedical ethics, data science, health professions education, health care delivery and access, informatics, omics, population health, sex and gender, and technology and digital tools), comprising 84 individuals, garnered expert opinion, reviewed relevant literature, engaged with patients, and developed key research questions. During the conference, each workgroup shared how they defined precision EM within their domain, presented relevant conceptual frameworks, and engaged a broad set of stakeholders to refine precision EM research questions using a multistage consensus-building process.


RESULTS
A total of 217 individuals participated in this initiative, of whom 115 were conference-day attendees. Consensus-building activities yielded a definition of precision EM and key research questions that comprised a new 10-year precision EM research agenda. The consensus process revealed three themes: (1) preeminence of data, (2) interconnectedness of research questions across domains, and (3) promises and pitfalls of advances in health technology and data science/artificial intelligence. The Health Professions Education Workgroup identified educational gaps in precision EM and discussed a training roadmap for the specialty.


CONCLUSIONS
A research agenda for precision EM, developed with extensive stakeholder input, recognizes the potential and challenges of precision EM.

Methods This study employed a rigorous bibliometric approach. We identified all endophthalmitis-related literature by conducting a comprehensive search of the Science Citation Index Expanded database under the Web of Science Core Collection. The data was then analyzed and visualized using CiteSpace and VOSviewer, two widely recognized software tools in the field of bibliometrics. CiteSpace was used to analyze the country distributions, dual map overlay of journals, keyword bursts, and co-cited references. VOSviewer was employed to describe the authors and co-cited authors, the journals, the co-cited journals, and the keywords co-occurrence network. This robust methodology ensures the reliability and validity of the study’s findings. Results A total of 2960 publications, including 2695 articles and 265 reviews, were included in this bibliometric study. There has been no shortage of endophthalmitis-related publications since 1993, with an apparent upward trend during recent years. Possible correlations with the COVID-19 pandemic are also analyzed. These studies were finished by 11,048 authors from 75 countries worldwide, with the United States in the lead. In the keyword co-occurrence network, except for the endophthalmitis term, cataract surgery becomes the keyword with the highest frequency. Different categories of endophthalmitis, including postoperative, post-injection, post-traumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis, and antibacterial and anti-inflammatory therapies of infectious endophthalmitis, are discussed by categories. From the perspective of the timeline, postoperative and post-injection endophthalmitis were the dominant forms before and after the year 2000, respectively. Co-citation analyses reveal that the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS) conducted in 1995 provides pivotal guidance for later research. Diverse pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Propionibacterium acnes, Viridians Streptococci, and Bacillus cereus) or fungi (e.g., Candida, Aspergillus, and Fusarium) contribute to varying treatment principles and clinical prognosis, which should be taken seriously. In addition, intravitreal and intracameral antibiotics are the mainstay for treating and preventing infectious endophthalmitis, respectively.

b33c6e5f49fa8788a92e11136bb7ae513e5879b6,Advancements and trends in exosome research in lung cancer from a bibliometric analysis (2004-2023).,"Background
Lung cancer, characterized by its high morbidity and lethality, necessitates thorough research to enhance our understanding of its pathogenesis and discover novel therapeutic approaches. Recent studies increasingly demonstrate that lung cancer cells can modulate the tumor microenvironment, promoting tumor growth, and metastasis through the release of exosomes. Exosomes are small vesicles secreted by cells and contain a variety of bioactive molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites. This paper presents a comprehensive review of exosome research in lung cancer and its progress through bibliometric analysis.


Methods
Publications related to exosomes in lung cancer patients were systematically searched on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviwers, CiteSpace, and the R package ""Bibliometrics"". Publications were quantitatively analyzed using Microsoft Office Excel 2019. The language of publication was restricted to ""English"" and the search strategy employed TS=(exosomes or exosomes or exosomes) and TS=(lung cancer). The search period commenced on January 1, 2004, and concluded on November 12, 2023, at noon. The selected literature types included Articles and Reviews.


Results
The study encompassed 1699 papers from 521 journals across 71 countries and 2105 institutions. Analysis revealed a consistent upward trend in lung cancer exosome research over the years, with a notable surge in recent times. This surge indicates a growing interest and depth of inquiry into lung cancer exosomes. Major research institutions in China and the United States, including Nanjing Medical University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Chinese Academy Of Sciences, and Utmd Anderson Cancer Center, emerged as crucial research hubs. The annual publication count in this field witnessed a continuous rise, particularly in recent years. Key terms such as lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), microvesicles, intercellular communication, exosomal miRNAs, and oncology dominated the research landscape. Fields like cell biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, and oncology exhibited close relation with this research. Clotilde Théry emerged as the most cited author in the field, underlining her significant contributions. These results demonstrate the broad impact of exosome research in lung cancer, with key terms covering not only disease-specific aspects such as lung cancer and NSCLC but also basic biological concepts like microvesicles and intercellular communication. Explorations into exosomal microRNAs and oncology have opened new avenues for lung cancer exosome research. In summary, lung cancer exosome research is poised to continue receiving attention, potentially leading to breakthroughs in treatment and prevention.


Conclusion
Publications on lung cancer exosomes show a rising trend year by year, with China and the United States ranking first and second in terms of the number of publications. However, there is insufficient academic learning cooperation and exchanges between the two sides, and Chinese universities account for a large proportion of research institutions in this field. Jing Li is the most productive author, Clotilde Théry is the most co-cited author, and Cancers is the journal with the highest number of publications.

de93e46f06c36e0757b6a4d2e22109d5f1473f1a,Evaluation of the first year of Pandora NO2 measurements over Beijing and application to satellite validation,"Abstract. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a highly photochemically reactive gas, has a lifetime of only a few hours, and at high concentrations is harmful to human beings. Therefore, it is important to monitor NO2 with high-precision, time-resolved instruments. To this end, a Pandora spectrometer has been installed on the roof of the laboratory building of the Aerospace Information Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the Olympic Park, Beijing, China. The concentrations of trace gases (including NO2, HCHO, O3) measured with Pandora are made available through the open-access Pandora database (https://data.pandonia-global-network.org/Beijing-RADI/Pandora171s1/, last access: 11 July 2023). In this paper, an overview is presented of the Pandora total and tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and surface concentrations collected during the first year of operation, i.e., from August 2021 to July 2022. The data show that NO2 concentrations were high in the winter and low in the summer, with a diurnal cycle where the concentrations reached a minimum during the daytime. The concentrations were significantly lower during the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, showing the effectiveness of the emission control measures during that period. The Pandora observations show that during northerly winds, clean air is transported to Beijing with low NO2 concentrations, whereas during southerly winds, pollution from surrounding areas is transported to Beijing and NO2 concentrations are high. The contribution of tropospheric NO2 to the total NO2 VCD varies significantly on daily to seasonal timescales; i.e., monthly averages vary between 50 % and 60 % in the winter and between 60 % and 70 % in the spring and autumn. A comparison of Pandora-measured surface concentrations with collocated in situ measurements using a Thermo Scientific 42i-TL analyzer shows that the Pandora data are low and that the relationship between Pandora-derived surface concentrations and in situ measurements is different for low and high NO2 concentrations. Explanations for these differences are offered in terms of measurement techniques and physical (transport) phenomena. The use of Pandora total and tropospheric NO2 VCDs for validation of collocated TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data, resampled to 100 m × 100 m, shows that although on average the TROPOMI VCDs are slightly lower, they are well within the expected error for TROPOMI of 0.5 Pmolec.cm-2 + (0.2 to 0.5) ⋅ VCDtrop (1 Pmolec.cm-2 = 1 × 1015 molec cm−2). The location of the Pandora instrument within a sub-orbital TROPOMI pixel of 3.5 km × 5.5 km may result in an error in the TROPOMI-derived tropospheric NO2 VCD between 0.223 and 0.282 Pmolec.cm-2, i.e., between 1.7 % and 2 %. In addition, the data also show that the Pandora observations at the Beijing-RADI site are representative of an area with a radius of 10 km.

The respondents of the study are the grade seven students of a private school in Dumaguete City, during the academic year 2023-2024. The researcher utilized the descriptive, correlational, comparative, and Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial (CRT) methods of research. This study also made use of researcher-made questionnaires that measured the performance of the students in using the two methods of instruction, respectively. The statistical tools used in this study include standard deviation, mean, t-tests for dependent and independent data, and Spearman’s rho. The findings revealed that there is a significant improvement in the student’s performance after using localized litmus paper (p=0.001 < α=0.05) and computer interactive simulator (p=0.000 < α=0.05). Overall, both methods of instruction proved to be vital and effective (p= 0.597 > 0.05) in the student’s learning of the concepts of acids and bases. The results suggest that both approaches can be valuable tools for educators, enabling them to effectively cater to students’ different learning styles or maximize teaching effectiveness through varied instructional strategies. While using both methods of instruction resulted in comparable posttest success, the usage must be coupled with classroom dynamics, a helpful learning environment, improved study habits of students, and teachers’ positive behavior to achieve higher student performance.

4cf4e72c5dcd32943b11f311bff1f47fbebb25d5,"Celiac Disease among Outpatient Attendees with Gastrointestinal Complaints at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Sana’a City, Yemen: A Four-Year Retrospective Study","Background: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy, which is caused by gluten in people with genetic predisposition regardless of age and gender. Its presentations can vary from asymptomatic nature to severe malnutrition. Diagnosis usually depends on serology and intestinal biopsy examination. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of CD and describe its clinical presentations and diagnostic approaches among patients with gastrointestinal complaints in Sana’a City, Yemen.
Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted using the medical records of patients diagnosed with CD at the University of Science and Technology Hospital (USTH) from January 2020 to December 2023. Out of 350 records for CD patients diagnosed during the study period, 155 records were complete and were used in describing the clinical presentations and diagnostic methods of CD among Yemeni patients. Data about sociodemographic characteristics, clinical presentations and diagnostic methods were collected using a pre-designed data collection sheet. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the collected data.
Results: Out of 160,000 patients attending the Gastroenterology Outpatient Department at the USTH from 2020 to 2023, 350 were diagnosed with CD, yielding a prevalence of 0.22%. The mean age of CD patients was 26 ± 14.6 years, with a majority being female (71%) and over half (54.8%) falling within the 20-40 age group. Clinically, more than half of the patients presented with abdominal pain (52.9%) and diarrhea (50.3%), followed by abdominal distention (25.8%) and weight loss (21.9%). Less frequent typical symptoms included vomiting (17.4%), anorexia (12.9%), and constipation (7.7%). Among atypical manifestations, fatigue and failure to thrive (9% each) were the most common, followed by anemia (7.7%), while rickets, bruising, and delayed puberty were rare (0.6% each). Diagnostic evaluation revealed that 78.4% of 87 patients tested were positive for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and 91% of 111 patients who underwent intestinal biopsy showed characteristic mucosal changes consistent with CD.
Conclusion: The prevalence of CD among patients with gastrointestinal complaints is low, compared to the global and regional trends of the disease, predominately affecting females. It mostly presents with typical gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly abdominal pain, diarrhea and distension. Although atypical non-gastrointestinal manifestations are infrequent, CD should be considered when dealing with patients having non-gastrointestinal problems. Healthcare providers should be educated about the importance of incorporating both serology and intestinal biopsy examination for the diagnosis of patients with suspected CD.",University of Science and Technology Journal for Medical Sciences,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.59222/ustjms.3.3?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.59222/ustjms.3.3, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional comparative study conducted at the Rawal Institute of Health Sciences RIHS Islamabad. The duration of the study was 3 months after approval by the Ethical Committee from June 2023 to August 2023. An electronic questionnaire was designed to assess the knowledge and attitude of first-year (G1) and final-year (G2) dental students studying at RIHS. The respondents had to agree or disagree with each statement of the questionnaire. The frequency and percentage for each response were calculated. All the items of the knowledge and attitude questionnaire were assessed for the difference in response between G1 and G2 groups with the help of the Chi-square test.
Results: The knowledge assessment section showed that both first-year and final-year student groups (G1, G2) had inadequate knowledge and discouraging attitudes toward Chat-GPT. 90.6% and 86.7% of G1 and G2 students knew about what Chat-GPT is and this was the only response that showed good knowledge in both groups. 71.1% of first-year students agreed to use Chat- GPT in education as compared to 60% of final-year students. The response of any group could not exceed 70% for any of the attitude questions. The difference in knowledge and attitude response was statistically insignificant between the G1 and G2 groups showing no relationship between the responses of the two groups.
Conclusion: These results highlight that there is a strong need to improve knowledge and a positive attitude towards the use of AI tools like Chat-GPT in dental students.

Infections like osteomyelitis and dental abscesses can spread to soft tissues and bones, causing tissue death, inflammation, and systemic effects. Benign and malignant tumors can develop from soft tissue, cartilage, or bone, posing challenges for diagnosis and treatment. Studies on their prevalence in local populations are rare, obscuring our understanding of regional health dynamics. Aim In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of bone pathologies documented over the last three years from 2021 to 2023. Materials and methods Histopathologically confirmed cases of bone pathologies at Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, India, were gathered from the institutional database (DIAS: Dental Information Archiving Software) from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023. They were categorized into groups of infectious and inflammatory lesions, fibro-osseous lesions, malignancies originating from bone, malignancies invading bone, and miscellaneous conditions. The data was then compiled into a Google spreadsheet (Google, Inc., Mountain View, USA) for further analysis. Graphs were created to visualize the prevalence of bone pathologies enabling a descriptive exploration of temporal trends. Results A total of 2626 biopsy records were reviewed. Among these, 242 (9.21%) cases of bone-related pathologies were included, and the remaining 2384 (90.79%) entities without any mention of bone were excluded. Overall, considering all three years, 43.8% (100) bone-related lesions were reported in 2021, 30.3% (77) in 2022 and 25.9% (65) in the year 2023. Under each category, infectious and inflammatory lesions for 40.5% (98), fibro-osseous lesions for 14.9% (36), benign lesions for 2.9% (7), malignancies originating from bone for 1.7% (4), malignancies invading bone for 38% (93), and miscellaneous conditions for 1.65% (4) were reported. The highest number of infectious and inflammatory pathologies (53%) were reported in 2021. A steep fall was observed in 2022 and 2023 under the infectious and inflammatory category.

Along with the occurrence of sports injuries, osteoarthritis is gradually showing a younger trend. Osteoarthritis has many causative factors, and its pathogenesis is currently unknown. Cellular senescence is a stable form of cell cycle arrest exhibited by cells in response to external stimuli and plays a role in a variety of diseases. And it is only in the last decade or so that cellular senescence has gradually become cross-linked with osteoarthritis. However, there is no comprehensive bibliometric analysis in this field. The aim of this study is to present the current status and research hotspots of cellular senescence in the field of osteoarthritis, and to predict the future trends of cellular senescence in osteoarthritis research from a bibliometric perspective. Methods: This study included 298 records of cellular senescence associated with osteoarthritis from 2009 to 2023, with data from the Web of Science Core Collection database. CiteSpace, Scimago Graphica software, VOSviewer, and the R package “bibliometrix” software were used to analyze regions, institutions, journals, authors, and keywords to predict recent trends in cellular senescence related to osteoarthritis research. Results: The number of publications related to cellular senescence associated with osteoarthritis is increasing year by year. China and the United States contribute more than 70% of the publications and are the mainstay of research in this field. Central South University is the most active institution with the largest number of publications. International Journal of Molecular Sciences is the most popular journal in the field with the largest number of publications, while Osteoarthritis and Cartilage is the most cited journal.

ed7bfee30934d5c61948dc35cf5023ef0fde2477,Cities 2023 Preface,"CITIES International Conference is an annual international conference organized by the Urban and Regional Planning Department of Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS Surabaya). The conference, which debuted in 2005, serves as a platform for academics and practitioners to present, disseminate, and discuss research results in the field of urban and regional planning. Through the efforts of all involved, CITIES has grown from a primarily national conference to one that attracts a diverse, worldwide audience from the Asian, European, Australian, and American continents. The CITIES International Conference in 2023 will take a grand design related to “TECHNOLOGY” and “INFRASTRUCTURE” in planning. Cities are centers of civilization, powerhouses of economic growth and innovation. However, urban planning faces challenges as cities transform into larger areas. One way to tackle this challenge is to embrace new technology trends that can help urban planners to help improve the quality of life in cities. Technology is becoming increasingly important in urban planning as a consequence of urban development, as well as ongoing changes, need to be projected. With this need in mind, CITIES International Conference 2023 is designed to be a meeting place for stakeholders, including academics, researchers, practitioners, and bureaucrats, both within and beyond national boundaries. The conference aims to disseminate research results and practical experiences at local, national, and global levels, and to share insight and recommendations on improving the quality of the city system in the future. This year, the CITIES International Conference 2023 will join the CIV-PLAN Join Conference organized by the Faculty of Civil, Planning, and Earth Engineering. The 1st edition of the CIV-PLAN Join Conference will be held in the city of Surabaya by elaborating on all departments in the faculty, including Civil Engineering, Architecture, Urban and Regional Planning, Geophysics, and Environmental Engineering. The theme raised in the joint conference is “SMART INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BETTER LIVING SOCIETY” which is held on October 25-26, 2023. The CITIES International Conference 2023 has agreed to be a part of the CIV-PLAN Joint Conference sub-event. It is hoped that with a joint conference like this, the CITIES International conference will be better known throughout the world and the cooperation that will be established will increase, especially for the media to exchange knowledge and maybe it will also be able to open relations with departments within the scientific cluster of the faculty of civil engineering, planning, and earth sciences. The CITIES conference has obtained a one-day slot (October 26) from the CIV-PLAN Joint Conference committee. On October 25, CITIES keynote speeches were given during the CIV-PLAN Joint Conference session by Prof. Tan Yigitcanlar (Queensland University of Technology) and Dr. Rulli Pratiwi Setiawan, S.T., M.Sc. (Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember). On the second day, parallel discussion sessions were held for all conference participants. These sessions were divided into three rooms based on the similarity of the sub-themes, including (1) Smart Infrastructure for Urban Development, (2) Sustainable Infrastructure Planning, and (3) Applied Technology for Planning. The committee closely monitored the event at the venue during these parallel discussion sessions. The time allocated for each speaker was 15 minutes, and the question-and- answer (Q&A) session for all presenters was 30 minutes. The Q&A session was carried out by both the moderator and other speakers on the panel. There are around 39 papers presented from various universities in Indonesia and abroad. In total, there were over 150 seminar participants from academic, government, and NGO institutions. Technically, the hybrid implementation of the CITIES conference went very smoothly. The participants’ enthusiasm during the conference remained high until the end of the event, as evident from the active participation during the Q&A session. The only issue during the conference was that some speakers experienced network disruptions due to poor signal conditions. However, this did not dampen our enthusiasm to share knowledge and improve communication between participants and presenters across countries. Overall, the CITIES 2023 conference was successfully held and resulted in fruitful discussion during our plenary and parallel sessions.

c84f8518d28a7ff2d4c82b3d67c506e302d991b9,William H. Newton-Smith (1943–2023),"William (Bill) Newton-Smith was a renowned Canadian philosopher of science who spent his career largely in Oxford and then at the Central European University in Hungary. Newton-Smith was born in Orillia, Ontario and completed a B.A. in mathematics and philosophy at Queen’s University, Canada. In his second year as an undergraduate, he decided he was a logical positivist. In the interview for an exchange scholarship with St Andrews, in which he would be successful and at which he would spend his third year, the head of the Queen’s philosophy Department remarked that he had thought logical positivism was dead. With the confidence of youth Newton-Smith replied that the fact that it may not be popular was no reason to think it wasn’t true! During his year at St Andrews he fell under the spell of the later Wittgenstein. Upon graduating from Queen’s in 1966, he went to Cornell to do a PhD, as Norman Malcolm had photocopies of all of Wittgenstein’s unpublished works. Unimpressed with Malcolm, NewtonSmith transferred to the analytic philosopher Max Black. He thought Black a great supervisor, lively and clear—just the sort of teacher and mentor he would himself become. But NewtonSmith had already decided to transfer to Oxford. Black didn’t want him leaving Ithaca without a Cornell degree, so he secured funding for him to do an MA over the summer. Once at Oxford, Newton-Smith became a leading figure there. He finished his DPhil under the supervision of the logician Arthur Prior. In 1970 he was elected a Fellow of Balliol College. He was a pillar of the College and the University, taking on important administrative positions for both. He was a beloved undergraduate tutor, lecturer, and supervisor of an astounding number of DPhil theses. He could make logic fun and had a fine nose for what was a good (and bad!) argument in a student’s work. Newton-Smith made important contributions in several areas of philosophy, especially the nature of time and the general philosophy of science. Perhaps his two most important works are The Structure of Time (1980) and The Rationality of Science (1981). The latter appeared in the middle of the realism debate, a hot topic at any time but particularly so in the late 70s and early 80s. Even after four decades it stands up well and gives an excellent snapshot of his realistic approach to philosophy. Newton-Smith was a scientific realist; he had no qualms about the theoretical entities postulated by science, though he did have an interestingly radical solution to one problem that presses in on the realist. He was also a rationalist; he believed that science has clearly progressed and part of the philosopher’s job is to explain or make sense of that progress. As Newton-Smith saw it, there are a number of challenges which face the traditional rationalist, including: overcoming the problem of incommensurability (the same term could have different meanings in different theories); it must be shown that science does indeed have a goal; and explaining how the normative methods of science lead to that goal. Finally, it must be shown there is a good fit between the prescriptive philosophy of science and the descriptive history of science, for only then can we give a satisfactory account of real scientific change.",International Studies in the Philosophy of Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/02698595.2023.2208416?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/02698595.2023.2208416, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

63b0e836cc7f7adcfc5f7d42084f896b6a7775db,Implementation of the WPA Action Plan 2020‐2023: an update,"The year 2021 has been another tough one for us all. Uncertainty about the COVID situation, restrictions about travel, and difficulties in getting connected have been the major issues that have affected our professional work and personal lives during that year. The WPA has also struggled coping with these limitations. However, that period has given us some motivation and new insight to work under difficult circumstances and to continue with the implementation of our Action Plan 20202023. The WPA Executive Committee and Standing Committees, along with the Secretariat staff, remained committed to fulfil their responsibilities. The WPA’s drive to encourage and inspire learning among colleagues and trainees around the world led to offering more online educational activities during 2021. We were delighted to organize, support and promote several new educational modules, courses, teaching sessions and online programmes. The accelerated development of the WPA education portal and learning management system (LMS) has promoted the launch of new education and training modules to support our young professionals, especially for the emergency response measures during the pandemic period. The first of these modules supports psychiatrists in using e-mental health tools. The portal also gives ready access to WPA’s existing training materials available in several languages. Available programmes also include ICD-11 and Yoga courses, free webinars on Early Intervention in Psychosis, updates in Psychopharmacology and courses on Telepsychiatry, Psychotherapy and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. We continued with our projects outlined in the Action Plan. Various Working Groups offered a number of activities in ar eas of training, research and clinical updates. The Working Groups on Co-morbidity in Mental Illnesses, Early Intervention in Psychosis, Public Mental Health, and Promotion of Psychiatry among Medical Students highlighted their contributions in various activities. I am pleased that we also completed some unfinished projects started in the previous triennium. The WPA Scientific Sections likewise supported the scientific work of the Association in an inspiring way. Since the start of the network of WPA Collaborating Centres in 2016, these centres are providing practical advice on teaching, policy, research and clinical activities in psychiatry worldwide. During 2021, the network, now including eight sites, supported the implementation of the WPA’s strategic plan to build a global alliance for better mental health. In addition to the pandemic, unfortunately, we saw many adversities in 2021 in several parts of the world. Following WPA’s mission to help and support our membership during disasters, we established an Advisory Committee for Responses to Emergencies (ACRE), that brought together the leaders of the larger Member Societies to facilitate practical and concrete aid to Member Societies in need. This work continued mobilizing and fostering education, in formation collection, and development of lo cal, national and international strategies to cope with the mental health consequenc es of emergencies throughout 202021. The WPA recently formed a sub-committee of the ACRE for Afghanistan’s deteriorating conditions, that are not only causing an humanitarian crisis but also adding concerns about provisions and delivery of health care for the general population. We, at the WPA, as a part of our ACRE project, are working with our fellow Afghan mental health professionals to offer ongoing support through the provision of medicines, patient assessments and training. With the start of the WPA eNewsletter in 2021, we are facilitating sharing of activities and reports from our membership. The Newsletter has emerged as a strong medium for our visibility on the social media platform and a better communication among different components of the Association. World Psychiatry, the WPA official journal, achieved an impact factor of 49.548. It was reaffirmed that it is ranked as the number one in the list of psychiatric journals and in the Social Science Citation Index, and number five among all the journals in the Clinical Medicine category. The journal is published regularly in three languages (English, Spanish and Russian), with individual issues or articles also available on the WPA website in other languages (Chinese, French, Arabic, Turkish, Japanese, Romanian and Polish). More than 60,000 mental health professionals regularly receive the electronic or the print version of the journal. All the back issues can be freely downloaded from the PubMed system and the WPA website. We very much enjoyed our successful virtual World Congress of Psychiatry that took place in October 2021. As always, the current pandemic is all about adapting and innovating, and we feel that we were able to redesign the event from the ground up to ensure that we could bring the most timely clinical, academic and research topics to our membership. I am also pleased that we are actively working for our next World Congress to be held in Bangkok on August 3-6, 2022. We are optimistic that the new challenges that will undoubtedly come, as the full impact on mental health following this pandemic becomes evident, will be addressed effectively. Like many, the WPA is learning fast with the changes and looks forward with confidence to its future, remaining fully committed to fulfilling its triennium’s goals. Let’s shape the future of psychiatry and mental health together.",World Psychiatry,2022.0,25,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/wps.20978', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/wps.20978?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20978, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

TaRL is an approach to learning that aims to ensure that students understand the subject matter being taught. It focuses on identifying students' levels of understanding and aligning them with the appropriate level of learning. The research method uses descriptive language with two cycles. Data analysis techniques use qualitative and quantitative analysis. Each cycle consists of planning, implementation, observation, and reflection. The subjects of this research were 40 class XD students at SMAN 7 Banjarmasin for the 2022–2023 academic year. The learning process in TaRL groups students into three categories, namely students with intermediate, above, and below-average levels. Material and problems are given according to their level of learning, but still with the same learning objectives and outcomes. Student learning outcomes in learning activities increased from pre-cycle, showing a classical completeness of 32.5%; cycle I showed a classical completeness of 62.5%; and cycle II had reached the success indicator with a classical completeness of 87.5%.

47415bf311fa37215252b73dff7e2028367c8d76,Updated science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators including retraction data,"Citation metrics are widely used in research appraisal, but they provide incomplete views of scientists’ impact and research track record. Other indicators of research practices should be linked to citation data. We have updated a Scopus-based database of highly-cited scientists (top-2% in each scientific subfield according to a composite citation indicator) to incorporate retraction data. Using data from the Retraction Watch database (RWDB), retraction records were linked to Scopus citation data. Of 55,237 items in RWDB as of August 15, 2024, we excluded non-retractions, retractions clearly not due to any author error, retractions where the paper had been republished, and items not linkable to Scopus records. Eventually 39,468 eligible retractions were linked to Scopus. Among 217,097 top-cited scientists in career-long impact and 223,152 in single recent year (2023) impact, 7,083 (3.3%) and 8,747 (4.0%), respectively, had at least one retraction. Scientists with retracted publications had younger publication age, higher self-citation rates, and larger publication volume than those without any retracted publications. Retractions were more common in the life sciences and rare or nonexistent in several other disciplines. In several developing countries, very high proportions of top-cited scientists had retractions (highest in Senegal (66.7%), Ecuador (28.6%) and Pakistan (27.8%) in career-long citation impact lists). Variability in retraction rates across fields and countries suggests differences in research practices, scrutiny, and ease of retraction. Addition of retraction data enhances the granularity of top-cited scientists’ profiles, aiding in responsible research evaluation. However, caution is needed when interpreting retractions, as they do not always signify misconduct; further analysis on a case-by-case basis is essential.

The NSMQ is an annual live science and mathematics competition for senior secondary school students in Ghana in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering questions across biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive stages until a winning team is crowned for that year. In this work, we built Brilla AI, an AI contestant that we deployed to unofficially compete remotely and live in the Riddles round of the 2023 NSMQ Grand Finale, the first of its kind in the 30-year history of the competition. Brilla AI is currently available as a web app that livestreams the Riddles round of the contest, and runs 4 machine learning systems: (1) speech to text (2) question extraction (3) question answering and (4) text to speech that work together in real-time to quickly and accurately provide an answer, and then say it with a Ghanaian accent. In its debut, our AI answered one of the 4 riddles ahead of the 3 human contesting teams, unofficially placing second (tied).

50f29011e5f9eb6243b4e4798afd6ec7a286c625,BrJAC 2023 – Growing and Building Bridges,"In 2010, in the first BrJAC Editorial, Kubota emphasized: “We are launching BrJAC – Brazilian Journal of Analytical Chemistry to open a discussion about the real role of the Analytical Chemistry for the development of the country and bring the improvement of the life quality. BrJAC is an Analytical Chemistry journal whose goal is to debate, discuss, show trends, and needs with opinion editorials and interviews with renowned investigators, besides publishing scientific papers from the academic and industry, fulfilling the idealistic purpose of a group of people to achieve actual academic industrial integration towards innovation and technical-scientific development.”1 In this same issue I had the opportunity to write a Point of View and I stated: “The launching of Brazilian Journal of Analytical Chemistry (BrJAC) is a milestone with full potential to expand the flow of knowledge. The integration of academy and industry is a must and BrJAC will certainly play a major role in putting them in contact.”2 After a relatively short span of time (just 13 years!), it is amazing to think about how much was accomplished. As announced since the beginning, each issue has a great combination of reviews, scientific articles, points of view, letters, sponsors’ reports, releases, news, and interviews. This list of contents is part of the identity of BrJAC and each section plays a special role. Of course, articles are the core of any scientific journal, but to create and consolidate bridges we need to integrate academia and industry, so different forms of communication are in the BrJAC fingerprint. And how could we move ahead without listening to well-known analytical chemists? Fortunately, since its beginning, BrJAC has opened its pages for interviews. We began in 2010 with Prof. Carol Hollingworth Collins (Institute of Chemistry, State University of Campinas)3 and travelled all the way to Dr. Joanna Szpunar (National Research Council of France, CNRS) in the last issue.4 I have no doubt that important landmarks of the history of analytical chemistry in Brazil were revealed in a colloquial atmosphere in these interviews. Recently, Marco Arruda, the Editor-in-Chief, posted a letter on the journal website entitled, “From dream to reality”5 and invited us to celebrate the indexation of BrJAC by Clarivate and its starting impact factor of 0.7. Certainly, the Brazilian community in analytical chemistry has a lot to celebrate and it is amazing to reach this point when we think about the challenges along the 13-year road (and please keep counting!). In his letter, Marco Arruda mentioned challenges related to logistics, economy, ethics, and scientific quality. Surely, these are critical aspects. We live in an increasingly complex society full of opportunities and challenges. I am not thinking about political turmoil, social inequalities, and climate crisis. You know how big these challenges are. However, I would like to mention two other major challenges that we have coped with (or we are coping with) during the lifetime of BrJAC. One critical moment was the years of the COVID-19 pandemic and how they affected our way of life. We are still trying to understand all that has happened and how we have changed. The economy was affected. Work routines were affected. Families and friends were affected. Institutions were affected. Once again, we have practiced important human values, such as solidarity, fraternity, and the shared goal to move ahead as a society. Once again, science has rescued us. Another major influence when thinking about complexity and the scientific literature comes from predatory journals. The routinization of research and its diffusion are landmarks for the evolution of science, technology, and innovation. Scientific journals are important foundations for dissemination of research. Notwithstanding, nowadays we are coping with paper mills that produce fake papers just for profit. Recently, we are starting to face the dangerous combination of paper mills and artificial intelligence to produce polluted science. Despite some clouds on the horizon, it is great to see how the BrJAC community was able to grow during these hard times. We have achievements to celebrate and BrJAC is a great one. Recently, The Analytical Scientist asked researchers about the biggest challenge facing the analytical chemistry field.6 I would like to highlight the comments expressed by Prof. Robert Graham Cooks: “A lack of appreciation of the intricacies of analytical science by other disciplines (especially chemists) who see it as little more than an exercise in measurement using commercial instrumentation. Like modern day pharaohs, the organic synthetic chemist commands – “measure it!” – without pausing to recognize the ingenuity that went into the slaves’ work of conceiving the method, building the instrumentation, and achieving useful performance criteria. The “measure it” request at the end of that multi-year process is often a simple application, but the process that allows it is a unique combination of new scientific insights and skillful technology.”. And Richard Zare: “Simply put, gaining more respect for analytical science’s importance to understanding nature.”. I do think BrJAC is part of the multifarious mechanism to bring better understanding and more respect to analytical sciences. Let us keep our focus and strength. As always, “time keeps flowing like a river” (Time, The Alan Parsons Project).",Brazilian Journal of Analytical Chemistry,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.30744/brjac.2179-3425.point-of-view-janobrega.n42', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30744/brjac.2179-3425.point-of-view-janobrega.n42?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30744/brjac.2179-3425.point-of-view-janobrega.n42, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

According to the current Slovenian science curriculum, environmental concepts, as a part of science-oriented sustainable development goals, are an integral part of the subject of science. In 2026, a new science curriculum will be introduced in the education system to provide students and teachers with competences for sustainable development. Consequently, the aim of this study is 1) to analyse old (valid prior to the 2010/2011 school year) and current 6th and 7th-grade Slovenian science curriculum for primary school from an environmental and sustainability perspective, and 2) to investigate textual and pictorial material of four 6th grade and four 7th grade textbooks available for students in the current school year (2023/24) of primary school, that relate to environmental content, as well as their overall structure. The analysis of the textbooks showed that all textbooks explain some environmental topics recommended by the national curriculum. The text is supported by pictorial elements that present phenomena with realistic pictures on the macrolevel. The present study suggests that some environmental content is present in 6th- and 7th-grade science textbooks that are consistent with the learning goals of the curriculum but that a significant amount of sustainability content is missing. For this reason, the curriculum reform currently underway in Slovenia should more clearly include the implementation and thoroughly consider the integration of science-oriented sustainable development goals into the science curriculum in Grades 6 and 7.",Center for Educational Policy Studies Journal,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://cepsj.si/index.php/cepsj/article/download/1792/732', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.26529/cepsj.1792?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.26529/cepsj.1792, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Along four issues, our Journal has been faced with many different aspects of animal farm production, among them mainly circular economy strategy, non-conventional feed resources, and community-based livestock programs. All these different aspects have a common point: boost and develop the livestock farming system, in terms of competitiveness and profitability. Looking at the different articles collected and published during this year, the incorporation of locally available novel feed resource alternatives can promote circular economy concepts, increase food security, and improve sustainable livestock production. By exploiting locally accessible resources, the inclusion of these materials in animal feed nutrition has significant potential to enhance livestock performance, lower production costs, and promote bioeconomy concepts. 
On the other hand, analysis of genomic data is an important resource for the effective management of small and endangered animal populations. The research activity of scientists has deeply been focused on developing breeding programs able to conserve animal biodiversity and monitor animal biodynamics. 
  
In the last Editorial article of 2023, I am going to introduce the contents of the articles collected and published in the fourth issue of 2023 year. 
Formelova et al. performed a study to evaluate the effect of dried hempseed cake (by-product of oil production) supplementation (5% - EG1 and 10% - EG2) to rabbit feed mixture on livestock performances, quality of meat, digestibility of nutrients and animal health status. All obtained data let Authors to recommend the inclusion of hempseed cake up to 10% in rabbit diet without any negative effect on animal welfare, livestock performance and quality of meat. 
Osaiyuwu et al. organized a study to provide useful information for the creation of sustainable breeding programmes and developing a sustainable use and conservation strategy aimed at developing highly producing Muscovy ducks in Nigeria; consequently, increasing the food security index of the nation and source of income for small-scale farmers. In general, the ducks from all seven ecogeographic locations were rather homogeneous than heterogeneous. 
Mekonnen et al., had the prime objective to survey and characterize the husbandry practices of the different indigenous sheep populations. Authors concluded the study claiming a need of feed development, shift to modern husbandry practices, access to veterinary services, indigenous sheep conservation through utilization, control of inbreeding, ram-to-ewe ratio, fattening and castration should be of future attention of farmers and stakeholders. 
Ajayi et al., to justify the use of duckweed as an alternative and novel aquatic-derived fodder in ruminants' feeding strategies, performed preliminary investigation via in vitro gas production technique. The study assessed the nutrient and mineral potential, secondary metabolites and in vitro gas production characteristics of duckweed to estimate the short-chain volatile fatty acids, metabolizable energy, organic matter digestibility and apparent in vitro dry matter degradability. In conclusion, duckweed from earthen fish ponds is fairly degradable in vitro, and the nutrient contents elucidate its forage value for ruminants.

 Citizen science is becoming very useful in surveying and monitoring biodiversity. Within the European Union LIFE medCLIFFS project, a network of volunteers has been established for the detection and long-term monitoring of invasive plant species that threaten the endemic flora of Mediterranean cliffs in north-eastern Spain. Through iNaturalist, volunteers record various data along a series of 1 km transects. Based on the ca. 700 observations collected by volunteers in 2023 (the first year of the project), a simple and visually-attractive methodology for assessing the recorded populations has been developed. This method classifies populations into one of three population dynamics categories: (1) propagative behavior (i.e., populations with seedlings or young plants but lacking senescent or dead individuals); (2) senescent behavior (i.e., showing senescent/dead plants but lacking seedlings/juveniles); and (3) a mixed behavior (i.e., containing both). This methodology, whose outputs are easily interpretable as heatmaps, allows the collection of large datasets on invasive plants by citizen scientists, with two main purposes: (1) knowing which species are most concerning based on simple, straightforward observations of their population dynamics; and (2) identifying which regions of the study area are more problematic and, thus, where management efforts should be directed.",Invasive Plant Science and Management,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/inp.2024.40?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/inp.2024.40, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This is taking place against the backdrop of a shortage of teachers from various science subjects, especially physics. They are increasingly being replaced by non-professional teachers, often those with a Master of Primary Education, which gives access to the profession of primary junior grade teacher. In this study, the subject matter knowledge (SMK) in science of 44 pre-service teachers aiming for the above-mentioned degree is examined using the SMK test. The test contains 40 trends in international mathematics and science study (TIMSS) items from the 4th-grade science content domain Physical Science and allowed us to compare the achievement of our respondents with the achievement of pupils who participated in the TIMSS assessments. The results show that the percentage correctness of the pre-service teachers on the SMK test was statistically significantly higher than that of the 4th-grade pupils. However, the correlation coefficients showed that the pre-service teachers had greater difficulties with the items with which the pupils had greater difficulties, and vice versa. This applies in particular to the items on forces and motion and to the items from the cognitive domain of reasoning. The reason for the unsatisfactory science SMK of our respondents could be the incompatibility of the university science curriculum with the demands placed on pupils in the relevant school subjects and International science assessments such as TIMSS.

This qualitative case study explored the root causes of physics aversion among Grade 12 STEM students at RPMD National Science High School in Marawi City, Philippines. Ten Grade 12 students enrolled in the 2023-2024 academic year were selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected through one-on-one in-depth interviews to capture participants’ perceptions and experiences with physics. The audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. From the data, 15 codes emerged, which were grouped into four overarching themes: Mathematical Challenges, Teaching-Related Issues, Language and Comprehension, and Personal and Social Factors. Key findings revealed that mathematical challenges, such as difficulty with complex equations, problem-solving, and formula memorization, were the most frequently cited barriers. These issues were often exacerbated by mathematics anxiety and inadequate foundational skills. Teaching-related issues, including ineffective instructional methods, disorganized presentations, and lack of engagement, significantly hindered students’ understanding and interest. Language barriers, especially in decoding technical terminology and understanding word problems, compounded these difficulties. Personal and social factors, including a lack of interest in physics, peer influence, and perceived irrelevance to future career goals, further contributed to the aversion. The study highlights the urgent need for student-centered teaching approaches, such as active learning strategies, differentiated instruction, and linguistic scaffolding, to address these challenges. Policymakers and educators are encouraged to implement holistic interventions to create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment. Future research should investigate these dynamics across diverse educational contexts and assess the impact of targeted interventions on reducing physics aversion.",International journal of research and innovation in social science,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47772/ijriss.2024.803465s?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2024.803465s, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods/Study Population: In 2023, the University of Wisconsin Institute for Clinical and Translational Research received NIH R13 funding to host a conference, the Science of Effective Mentorship (Asquith, McDaniels, et.al., 2023). Approximately 150 researchers and program leaders from Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Hubs and beyond attended. Data were collected before, during, and after the conference, providing the authors with an initial idea of community needs. As a result, a mentorship CoP was formed. In the subsequent 18 months, a steering and advisory committee established a program of virtual, topic-focused virtual events every 3 months as well as a community website, with increasing attendance and utilization. A survey was disseminated after the completion of one year, and a focus group was held during the last virtual gathering. Results/Anticipated Results: The demand for infrastructure to support a national community of practice will be demonstrated. The demographic and positional diversity (e.g. role within a CTSA Hub) will highlight the opportunities of convening this diverse community. Organizational challenges and opportunities will be highlighted. Assessment data will reveal the broad range of needs and interests of participants. Aggregate demographic, professional, and participation data about community of practice members will be shared, as well as the governance and programmatic elements of this community of practice. Evaluation results from the first year of activity will be displayed. Needs for sustainability will be discussed. Discussion/Significance of Impact: CoPs are not new in the CTR space.

Methods/Study Population: To evaluate CTSI-RAP’s impact, we surveyed students using the REDCap platform between May and June 2023. The survey captured data on demographics, academic background, motivations for joining, and engagement in clinical research activities. Students also provided self-assessments of how the program influenced their career interests. Both descriptive and qualitative analyses were then used to assess key factors influencing students’ experiences, including the program’s impact on career decisions in healthcare and clinical research. Results/Anticipated Results: Out of 43 students surveyed, 40 responded (93%). Before entering, 84.2% of students had less than one year of research experience, and most students (73.6%) did not have family members in healthcare or research professions. Top reasons for joining were gaining clinical research exposure, healthcare setting experience, and pursuing healthcare careers. Overall, 97% of students stated CTSI-RAP “definitely” or “most probably” confirmed their interest in medicine and 76% of students reported CTSI-RAP has “definitely” or “most probably” solidified their interest in clinical research. 100% of students who have applied for a job, professional school, scholarship, or internship included CTSI-RAP as a meaningful experience, reflecting the program’s mission to provide motivations for a career in medicine and science.

What began as a routine traffic stop quickly escalated into a confrontation. Ultimately, the trooper arrested Bland, and three days later, she was found dead in her jail cell. Dash camera footage, alongside bystander cell phone recordings, captured Bland’s interaction with law enforcement. Many of those watching quickly cast Bland’s demeanor through the lens of the ""Angry Black Woman"" (ABW) stereotype—a deeply ingrained cultural narrative that portrays Black women as hostile, overly aggressive, and defiant. This review paper aims to uncover the role of contemporary surveillance technologies in reinforcing or challenging the ""Angry Black Woman"" (ABW) stereotype within policing and the criminal justice system. The study involved a comprehensive review of 41 scholarly sources published from 2019 to 2023, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria focusing on the intersections of race, gender, and surveillance technology in policing.

257c72e98b5b0a3ab4dfcf7e19a428fcbf689dec,Hot topics for the European Journal of Clinical Investigation in 2023,"Among the articles published in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation (EJCI) in 2021, COVID19related papers are still the most impacting ones.1– 3 We believe that COVID19 pandemic both in real life and in scientific Journals such as EJCI will certainly remain a hot topic in 2023. In fact, we believe that the evolution of COVID19 pandemic deserves additional indepth studies potentially clarifying its manifestations and consequences worldwide. As an example, the rate of COVID19 reinfections that was quite low as reported by Pilz et al. till early 20212 seems to increase and might impact our lives again in the coming months since the writing of the current editorial (December 2022). A better knowledge of COVID19related pathophysiological mechanisms will certainly help clinicians and the whole health community to develop effective strategic plans to get prepared for a sustainable future with COVID19. A second hottopic research area of interest for EJCI will be represented by both cardiovascular and oncological diseases. Acute cardiovascular events, heart failure and cancer are known major causes of mortality worldwide. COVID19 pandemic has tremendously delayed both primary and secondary prevention visits, thus worsening health performance and increasing the burden on patients and health systems. In order to bridge the existing gap because of the COVID19 pandemic, original research articles, reviews and metaanalyses on cardiovascular or oncological research areas are more than welcome for EJCI. We want to stress that not only clinical but also basic and translational science is of great interest to EJCI. For sure, final acceptance will be based on a peerreview process that can be fasttracked for particular highimpact articles. A third hot topic for EJCI comes from a completely different view regarding the management of patient care. First, the costs of patient care are increasing tremendously every year. Second, we have enough medical doctors but a big shortage of health care personnel both nurses and technicians. This human resource problem has a direct negative impact on our capacity in the emergency room, hospital admittance and operating theatre. Our incompetence in patient care was already there but became transparent during the COVID pandemic. It is unacceptable that patients are dying on the waiting list for treatment for chronic conditions in our welldeveloped and wealthy societies. It is obvious that the increasing costs are not only driven by the aging population and very costeffective treatment modalities such as device and advanced pharmacological therapy (heart failure, cancer immunology therapy, biologicals in rheumatology), but also cuttingedge novel geneticallybased opportunities such as COVID19 RNA vaccines and other very promising upcoming therapeutical options. It is obvious that appropriate political decisions are necessary for better management and financial support of patient care. For healthy aging, it is crucial to focus on prevention from the very beginning of life from the early pregnancy till our last breath. Successful prevention strategies will help everyone and will help to diminish inequalities in our society and maybe around the world. Financial investment for population and patient care management is necessary, as everyone deserves a good quality of life. So, smart solutions in patient care are important to improve the (cost)effectiveness of our work. As an example, we want to mention a recent publication in EJCI regarding the management of patients with atrial fibrillation by MazónRamos et al.4 An excellent collaboration between general practitioner and cardiologist using a shared electronic dossier improves the start of anticoagulation treatment tremendously. Out of the box thinking and collaboration on different levels in our facility, country and worldwide is necessary to fight the future expectations of a healthy living. The lessons we learned from the COVID pandemic are very helpful in this regard. So, we also welcome articles regarding the prevention and management of our health care system for publication in EJCI. As Editors of a scientific Journal historically considering articles from Internal and General Medicine domain, we would suggest an additional hottopic area for EJCI to attract position papers and guidelines to help physicians to manage frail patients with several comorbidities.

0b3526514a4c56b3ca528f1e39f7a3b1527d8a3a,199 Early expansion and outcomes of a multilingual Latine review board for inclusive science,"OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The NC Translational and Clinical Sciences (NC TraCS) Institute’s Latine Community Review Board (CRB) provides expertise to researchers seeking to culturally adapt interventions and improve language access in clinical and translational science. Early efforts aimed to expand CRB membership, build member capacity, and assess CRB impact. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Founded in 2021, the NC TraCS Latine CRB is an advisory group of natively Spanish-speaking, Latine North Carolinians who contract with research teams (RTs) to review Latine community-facing study materials (e.g., decision aids, scales, recruitment scripts) and provide feedback for improving or validating materials’ linguistic accuracy and cultural relevance. Bilingual staff facilitate members’ review of materials, use focus group methods to solicit feedback, and report key findings and suggested revisions to RTs. In 2023, we recruited new age-, gender-, and racially diverse members; and implemented process and impact evaluation, via (1) post surveys of RTs and (2) assessment of members’ experiences and visions for growth utilizing the Focused Conversation Method (Top-network, 2021). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Since 2021, NC TraCS has conducted 11 Latine CRB review sessions to support 7 research studies. Current CRB members (n=8) report that (1) their work effectively supports Latine inclusion in research; (2) increased group size and diversity help ensure study materials are comprehensible to heterogenous Latine populations; and (3) an hourly member compensation rate equal to the hourly rate of TraCS’ staff accurately represents member contributions. Members also cited that they value open communication, continuous improvement, communication via email and group chat, periodic programming meetings, and RT updates on study outcomes. Post-session RT surveys to date (n=3) show that RTs would recommend this program to other researchers (pending survey responses from RTs this year will provide additional impact data). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Early data highlight the value of fairly compensated, bilingually coordinated input from diverse Latine community members for improving studies’ inclusion of heterogeneous, multilingual communities. Our approach can inform the development, growth, and continuous improvement of multilingual review boards at other research institutions.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/AB745836ECB31E2B9D36751795AFC757/S2059866124001900a.pdf/div-class-title-199-early-expansion-and-outcomes-of-a-multilingual-latine-review-board-for-inclusive-science-div.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11026749, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

61ad184cca3677e751454292bbcee802d31ab07f,Towards a New Artificial Intelligence-based Framework for Teachers’ Online Continuous Professional Development Programs: Systematic Review,"—In recent years, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field has witnessed rapid growth, affecting diverse sectors, including education. In this systematic review of literature, we aimed to analyze studies concerning the integration of AI in the continuous professional development (CPD) of teachers in order to generate a global vision on its potential to enhance the quality of CPD programs in the international level, and to provide recommendations for its application in the Moroccan context. To achieve our objective, we conducted a research that involves a review of international indexed databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Eric) published between 2019 and 2023 using PICO framework to formulate our search query and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework to select 25 relevant studies based on include and exclude criteria like publishing year, type of documents, publishing mode, subject area, language, and other criteria. The results reveal that AI integration has a positive impact on CPD programs by offering beneficial intelligent tools that can tailor adaptive training programs to meet teachers’ specific needs, preferences, and proficiency levels. Furthermore, our findings identify the importance of integrating AI as a core topic within CPD programs to enhance teachers’ AI literacy, enabling them to effectively navigate and utilize AI-based tools in their educational environment. This is important for preparing teachers to engage with the technological advances shaping the educational system. In conclusion, our systematic review emphasizes the significance of AI integration in CPD programs and offers tailored recommendations for its implementation in the Moroccan educational context. By adopting these recommendations, Morocco will pave the way for a dynamic CPD framework that meets the evolving needs of educators and students alike.",International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,2024.0,9,"{'url': 'http://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume15No4/Paper_50-Towards_a_New_Artificial_Intelligence_based_Framework.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.14569/ijacsa.2024.0150450?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2024.0150450, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The growing need for foods with high protein levels makes aquaculture one of the fastest-growing food industries in the world. Some challenges of fishing production are related to obsolete aquaculture techniques, overexploitation of marine species, and lack of water quality control. This research systematically analyzes aquaculture technologies, such as sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and image processing. Through the systematic PRISMA process, 753 investigations published from 2012 to 2023 were analyzed based on a search in Scopus and Web of Science. It revealed a significant 70.5% increase in the number of articles published compared to the previous year, indicating a growing interest in this field. The results indicate that current aquaculture technologies are water monitoring sensors, AI methodologies such as K-means, and contour segmentation for computer vision. Also, it is reported that K means technologies offer an efficiency from 95% to 98%. These methods allow decisions based on data patterns and aquaculture insights.

Methods/Study Population: Survey questions were based upon specific components of CTSI-RAP that make it unique. Covered topics related to motivation for participation, meaningful experiences, program effectiveness, future use of RAP knowledge/training, and current career roles in the health professions and/or clinical research. The survey was built and analyzed in REDCap and deployed May–July 2023. The study received exempt certification from the IRB. The survey was sent to 123 alumni from the 2013 to 2021 cohorts. Bounced e-mails were followed up on and two reminder e-mails were sent to initial non-responders. Identifiable demographic information was separated from program evaluation questions for analysis. A subanalysis was performed to determine program impact on students who identified as underserved or disadvantaged. Results/Anticipated Results: Respondents included 82/123 (66.7%) alumni. The survey took approximately 15 minutes. Most of the students 64/82 (78.0%) had 1 year or less research experience. The top three motivating factors for joining the RAP program were gaining clinical research experience, exposure to healthcare settings, and interest in pursuing a healthcare related career. Most alumni rated the overall effectiveness of the RAP program as very or somewhat valuable and the majority felt that the program ranked high or very high among their undergraduate experiences. The program was very influential or influential in defining their long-term plans and goals. Just under half felt that their career aspirations were changed or influenced by the program, which was especially true for those who identified as underserved/disadvantaged. Discussion/Significance of Impact: CTSI-RAP alumni highly value their experience in the program. They have benefitted professionally and are motivated to keep their connection to the program alive.

Evidence-based recommendations regarding interventional management strategies in this patient cohort are scarce. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of routine invasive vs. conservative management of NSTEACS by using individual patient data (IPD) from all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including older patients. Methods MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus were searched between 1 January 2010 and 11 September 2023. RCTs investigating routine invasive and conservative strategies in persons >70 years old with NSTEACS were included. Observational studies or trials involving populations outside the target range were excluded. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) at 1 year. One-stage IPD meta-analyses were adopted by use of random-effects and fixed-effect Cox models. This meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023379819). Results Six eligible studies were identified including 1479 participants. The primary endpoint occurred in 181 of 736 (24.5%) participants in the invasive management group compared with 215 of 743 (28.9%) participants in the conservative management group with a hazard ratio (HR) from random-effects model of 0.87 (95% CI 0.63–1.22; P = .43). The hazard for MI at 1 year was significantly lower in the invasive group compared with the conservative group (HR from random-effects model 0.62, 95% CI 0.44–0.87; P = .006). Similar results were seen for urgent revascularization (HR from random-effects model 0.41, 95% CI 0.18–0.95; P = .037). There was no significant difference in mortality. Conclusions No evidence was found that routine invasive treatment for NSTEACS in older patients reduces the risk of a composite of all-cause mortality and MI within 1 year compared with conservative management. However, there is convincing evidence that invasive treatment significantly lowers the risk of repeat MI or urgent revascularisation. Further evidence is needed from ongoing larger clinical trials.",European Heart Journal,2024.0,23,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae151/57195303/ehae151.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11177715, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d87dfd26c1edcfa60b5b2f843a5c07f6e9202313,Impact of Generative AI in Academic Integrity and Learning Outcomes: A Case Study in the Upper East Region,"With the increasing use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and Bard, universities face challenges in maintaining academic integrity. This research investigates the impact of these tools on learning outcomes (factual knowledge, comprehension, critical thinking) in selected universities of Ghana's Upper East Region during the 2023-2024 academic year. The study specifically analyzes changes in student comprehension and academic integrity concerns when using Generative AI for content generation, research assistance, and summarizing complex topics. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining qualitative data from interviews and open-ended questions with quantitative analysis of survey data and academic records. The research focuses on three institutions: C. K. Tedam University of Technology and Applied Sciences, Bolgatanga Technical University, and Regentropfen University College. A purposive sampling technique recruited 150 participants (50 from each university) who had used Generative AI tools. Key findings show that 72% of students reported improved understanding of course material through Generative AI use, yet 75% cited academic integrity as a primary concern. Quantitative analysis revealed a weak to moderate positive correlation (r = 0.45) between AI tool usage and improved grades, with variations depending on the specific AI tasks performed. Qualitative data highlighted concerns about overreliance on AI and its impact on critical thinking skills. 
This research contributes to the ongoing debate on AI's role in education by providing valuable insights for educators and policymakers worldwide. The findings suggest that while AI tools can enhance comprehension, ethical considerations and potential drawbacks related to critical thinking require careful attention. The study concludes with recommendations for integrating AI literacy programs, developing ethical guidelines, and implementing advanced plagiarism detection systems to harness the benefits of Generative AI while mitigating risks to academic integrity.

It is one of the metaheuristic algorithms inspired by root growth in plant behaviors. An article reviewed and analyzed bibliographic data on metaheuristics but is not specific on the topic of root growth algorithm. Therefore, this article presents a bibliometric analysis based on the topic of the root growth algorithm. It reviews the publication from the Scopus database. Based on the search process done on 14 February 2023 using the keywords of root growth algorithm, this article managed to gather 1836 articles from 1976-2023. However, this article only focuses on Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics to ensure it relates to the area the researcher wants to explore. Moreover, articles in the year 2023 will also be excluded due to incomplete data. After the researcher limited the data to those areas, it was reduced to 837 articles. This article uses three types of software: Microsoft Excel, VOSviewer software, and Harzing’s Publish or Perish software to analyze the frequency, visualization mapping, and citation metrics analysis, respectively. The finding from the bibliometric analysis shows the researcher has noticed that the total publication keeps increasing rapidly from 2014 until 2022.

The impact of social distance between students and their teachers is particularly apparent in large introductory classes, exacerbated by students' lack of common prior experience in computer science. Some institutions remedy class size and experience gaps by hiring advanced undergraduate students as teaching assistants for their introductory courses. However, without the resources to carefully hire, train, and manage undergraduate teaching assistants (uTAs) during the semester, their potential as trustworthy peer mentors and helpful tutors often goes unrealized. This poster presents details of the uTA hiring process, training course, and management strategies used during the 2022-2023 academic year for the introductory computer science courses at the University of Delaware (UD), a large, public, research-focused institution. This system was designed for introductory CS classes, with the goals of low instructor overhead, long-term scalability, and the development of empathetic teaching assistants who could motivate students toward successful learning. Highlights of the system include a hiring process that considers candidates' personality and enthusiasm alongside their technical skills, asynchronous training provided through the university's learning management system, and the use of a head uTA to manage other staff members. Following the implementation of these policies, instructors and uTAs alike reported positive experiences compared to previous semesters without significant changes to students' learning outcomes.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3626253.3635613?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3626253.3635613, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d5d94cbe1b4e88b38c5a85e0e8f7e787feade916,The utility of high-dosage experiments in everyday life to test theories in clinical science.,"This viewpoint article discusses the utility of high-dosage experiments (HDEs) in everyday life to test theories in clinical science. HDEs involve experimental manipulations and assessments that occur over much longer periods of time than traditional experiments-generally days or even weeks. By nature, they also occur outside the lab, in the everyday environments of participants. Additionally, as with other experiments, the purpose of the study is concealed from participants. Experimental design is one of the most distinguishable characteristics of psychology that separates it from other behavioral sciences. Studies that rely on experiments are essential for theory testing and establishing the potential causal role of mechanisms that underlie psychopathology. Yet despite the value of experimental research, experimental studies are not currently given special prominence in clinical psychological science. For example, in the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, of all the empirical studies in the most recent year (2023), only three of 77 incorporated an experimental manipulation. Experimental research appears to be less popular in clinical psychology than in other fields, such as social psychology. What might account for this discrepancy? First, clinical samples are more difficult to recruit. This is important because experimental manipulations may produce small effects that require large samples for detection. Additionally, mechanisms hypothesized to underlie psychopathology are often chronic and intransigent. For example, cognitive factors (e.g., perfectionistic beliefs) could require an especially strong manipulation to modify in isolation. Researchers have argued that psychology has been experiencing a crisis in theory development. Eronen and Bringmann (2021) stated that one major reason for this crisis is the difficulty in establishing causal relationships between psychological constructs. The replication crisis has garnered even more attention (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). HDEs would help address these two crises and provide stronger and more replicable tests of theory. This could allow us to more precisely identify important mechanisms underlying psychopathology, potentially enhancing treatment efficacy, and enabling us to move the field forward.

015198e537da92e91cdc8ee6b59fc38ec560532c,30th NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC PRACTICAL CONFERENCE “NATURAL SCIENCE EDUCATION IN A COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL – 2024”: CONFERENCE REVIEW,"2024 is a truly special year. This is the year of the Jubilee Scientific and Practical Conference ""Natural Science Education in a Comprehensive School - 2024"". And this was the thirtieth conference. Throughout this time, science, engineering and technology have developed at a significant and rapid pace. The theory and practice of science education has undoubtedly evolved, including the strategies and practices of science education. The importance of science and technology education is unquestioned, but its orientation towards competences, with an emphasis on learning through science and the linking/integration of science with other subjects, remains. 
The 30th Conference continued an already established practice. The conference took place over two days. The two-day conference focused on science and technology education, which has recently become a priority in society and is likely to remain so in the future. The 30th Conference started on 25 April. On the eve of the Conference, an informal round table discussion on ""Education issues"" was organised. 
The importance of the cultural programme should also be mentioned. On the first day, at the end of the conference, participants had the opportunity to get to know Plunge better. The most important places of the city were visited. The staff of the Plunge Tourism Information Centre organised a sightseeing tour of Plunge. The city centre, the central square and the church were visited. Participants had a unique opportunity to walk around the Plunge Smart Park and to visit the Plunge Manor House, or Mykolas Oginskis Palace, one of the most beautiful monuments of 19th-century Lithuanian architecture.
The plenary session of the conference provided a retrospective of all the conferences. Thirty years of really great organisational, managerial, publishing and other work. A total of 30 conference proceedings were published. It is estimated that a total of 677 papers were published, with a total page count of 4787. If all the pages were put together, it would be a single publication 281 mm thick. This is a really big work, a really good repository of scientific and didactic-methodological research and work. 
The work of this 30th conference has been recorded and is freely available on our YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoZNO1c3zi72-RxbETp4AmMQ8Lz2C-QPC). Most conference reports were presented in the form of articles and published in the conference proceedings.

0fe4422f63f888739debb346425c2ba5c22ed75e,156 Art as a Multiplier of Science Communication,"OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Scientists are increasingly confronted with 'science critical' #_msocom_1 belief systems. The politicization of science fuels hesitancy towards evidence-based therapies. To overcome these barriers, we aim to devise strategies to communicate clinical translational science (CTS) through art. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A two-year pilot artist-in-residency (AIR) program embedded in the Translational Research Immersion Program (TRIP). Since 2009, TRIP contributes to CTS Workforce Development (WD) through a 10-week mentored, curriculum-rich summer undergraduate research experience. Students are recruited from 5 regional institutions, 6 HBCUs, and the University of Puerto Rico. AIR is composed of 3 phases: the “Immersive Phase” where the artist gains intensive exposure to the scientific process through the lived experience of TRIP students, the “Productive Phase” where the artist conceptualizes the process of CTS into works of art, and the “Engagement Phase” where the CTS workforce, artists, and community members coalesce around science-to-art materializations. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In 2022 & 2023 the AIR participated in ~35hrs of CTS research seminars, panel discussions, and professional skills workshops. Additional TRIP student-AIR interaction occurred in focus groups including visits to mentor’s labs. An AIR-led workshop culminated in an Empowering CTS Communication event where TRIP students engaged with community members through elevator pitches of their CTS summer project on a speed-rotating basis. A month-long art-CTS exhibition planned for 3/2024 will feature contributions from AIR, TRIP students, and ITMAT community members. Qualitative insights were that TRIP is an effective art-science incubator, students strengthened their CTS communication skills, art functions as an icebreaker between science and communities with an ocean of opportunities for science education. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: AIR embedded into existing CTS WD programs is proposed as creative approach to strengthen the reputation of science in the public. CTS-informed art functions as connective tissue between public and CTS workforce. The hands-on experience to adopt art as a science communication tool is a powerful soft skill for the next generation of CTS investigators.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/A11D10F860E8F7E389B771C6F50B40C2/S2059866124001523a.pdf/div-class-title-156-art-as-a-multiplier-of-science-communication-div.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11026755, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Our study aimed to identify complications/side effects of WALANT upper limb procedures through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods This PROSPERO-registered study was performed with strict adherence to PRISMA guidelines. Embase, OVIDMedline, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched until February 2023. Inclusion criteria involved English articles, reporting complications/side effects in primary WALANT upper limb surgeries. Outcomes included all complications and side effects, data on the anaesthetic mixture, publication year/location, study type, and procedures performed. The meta-analysis employed the Freeman-Tukey Double Arcsine Transformation, computed I2 statistics, and utilized common or random effects models for pooled analysis. Results 2002 studies were identified; 79 studies met the inclusion criteria representing 15,595 WALANT patients. A total of 301 patients had complications, and the meta-analysis using a random effects model provided a complication rate of 1.7% (95% CI: 0.93–2.7%). The most reported complications were superficial infection (41%, n = 123/300), other/specified (12%, n = 37/300), and recurrent disease (6.7%, n = 20/300). A decade-by-decade analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in complication rates spanning the last three decades (p = 0.42). Adding sodium bicarbonate to the anaesthetic solution significantly reduced postoperative complications (p = 0.025). Conclusion WALANT has a low overall complication rate of 1.7%, with no significant temporal variation and a significant reduction in complications when sodium bicarbonate is added to the anaesthetic solution. Our findings support the safety of WALANT in upper limb procedures. Registration PROSPERO: CRD42023404018.

Four statistical methods were used. The first was multiple regression analysis to study the extent to which each student's mathematics score was affected on the general intelligence and emotional intelligence tests (Y), by the student's gender (X1) and his type of residence (X2). The second statistical method is to analyze the design of a factorial experiment to study the presence or absence of significant differences between the grades of students in the four stages by classifying the students in the four stages into males and females, as well as studying the significant difference in the scores of the two intelligence tests (general and emotional) for students in the Mathematics Department in general and divided according to gender. requester. The third method of analysis was to analyze the design of a completely randomized experiment to study the significant differences in students’ intelligence scores between the four academic levels in the mathematics department. If there is a significant difference in the results of analyzing the data in the above methods, then we use the fourth statistical method in this research, which is the analysis of the least significant difference test to study the differences between each two groups separately. The results of the data analysis were numerous, the most important of which is that the intelligence scores in the two tests (general intelligence and emotional intelligence) do not depend on nor are affected by the student’s gender or type of residence.

Evaluating lecturer performance is a crucial step in ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the teaching process which includes pedagogical, professional, personality, and social indicators. Conventional approaches are often complex and ineffective in identifying in-depth performance patterns. The K-Means Clustering algorithm enables the grouping of evaluation data into clusters based on feature similarities, thus revealing patterns that are difficult to discern manually. The data used in this study comes from lecturer evaluation questionnaires completed by students during the even semester of the 2022/2023 academic year. The results showed that the clustering process yielded good separation with a Silhouette Score of 0.593 and a Davies-Bouldin Index of 0.606. These findings indicate that the data within the clusters are more similar to each other than to data in different clusters, suggesting effective clustering. The insights gained from this study are expected to be valuable for the management and development of teaching quality and to promote the use of artificial intelligence technology in higher education evaluations.

b0cdf0a7c31b2d98a9951ab019bf95daedc433fc,Attitude and Challenges in Learning Mathematics in the Modern Word (MMW): Basis for Intervention Program,"Difficulty in learning mathematics is a common and significant problem throughout the school years. It was identified that only 19% of Filipino students met the Low benchmark, meaning they had “some basic mathematical knowledge,” while 81% did not reach this level. Filipino students also lagged behind other countries in the international assessment for mathematics as mentioned in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2019 (TIMSS).To address this; a researcher conducted a study to explore students’ attitudes and challenges in learning Mathematics in the Modern World (MMW). The data gathered were used in formulating intervention programs. The study utilized the descriptive method of research and employed a survey questionnaire as the main data-gathering instrument. It involved the participation of all college students from the University of Batangas who were taking Mathematics in the Modern World (MMW) during the school year 2022-2023 using a purposive sampling technique. Furthermore, the responses of the respondents were computed using frequency count, percentage, weighted mean, ranking, and chi-square as the main statistical treatments of data. Ethical guidelines were highly considered to maintain the confidentiality of the study. Key findings include that the majority of the students are 19-21 years old, male, and enrolled in Criminology courses. Students strongly agreed and exhibited a positive attitude toward wanting to develop their mathematical skills.

 There are three elements to this theme: petroleum, the first plus, and the second plus. Let me explain them one at a time.
 “Petroleum” refers to the challenges petroleum engineers face now and for the foreseeable future to provide the world with the hydrocarbon energy it needs. By hydrocarbons, I mean oil and natural gas, not coal.
 We can think of the entities that study and predict the world’s future need for energy as three groups: the government entities like the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the European Union International Energy Agency (IEA); the major international operators like ExxonMobil, Shell, etc.; and the national oil companies. The predictions provided by all three groups indicate the oil and natural gas share in the energy mix may decline slightly from a little over 50% currently to a little below 50% by 2050. However, the needed volume of hydrocarbons will increase as the world population moves from around 8 billion now to about 9.8 billion in 30 years and as the standard of living continues to improve in the developing regions such as Africa and Asia.
 When we look at the world’s current reserves and the current technology to produce these, you can add things up and see that we must continue our technical advancements to meet the growing demand for energy.

93157304708bad8373cc1bc057f412185ee212a2,Bridging Research and Practice: Swiss Olympic’s Approach to Sports Science and Innovation,"Swiss Olympic is the umbrella organisation for Swiss sport and supports the national sports federations at various levels, increasingly also in the area of (sports) science. Research, development and innovation are key factors in remaining competitive in the international sports competition.
Since 2018, the funds available for applied sports science have been significantly increased. With a budget of CHF 1.5 million per year, Swiss Olympic's ‘Sports Science’ funding programme is an essential source of funding for Swiss elite sport.
The aim of the ‘Sports Science’ funding programme is to promote practice-oriented (sports) science in the federations. This is to be achieved on the one hand by subsidising scientific staff and on the other by promoting scientific measures and projects.
In addition, the Sports Innovation Hub was launched in 2024 to increase competitiveness through innovative ideas and collaborative approaches. A maximum funding application of CHF 200,000 can be triggered per project. The fundings are awarded exclusively to national member federations of Swiss Olympic through applications.
The ‘embedded scientist’, a (sports) scientist embedded in the federation structure, is proving to be a promising model for conducting the most targeted and practice-oriented research possible due to its proximity to athletes, coaches and officials.
Nevertheless, linking universities, research and business remains a challenge, one of the three key points of Stöckli's (Chef de Mission Swiss Olympic) final statements after the 2024 Summer Olympics.

The aim of this work is to comprehensively review and synthesize the literature related to sinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) treatment with immunotherapy, including potentially targetable genetic mutations, survival outcomes, and adverse events.


DATA SOURCES
Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science.


REVIEW METHODS
The study protocol was designed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis statement. Databases were searched from inception through May 23, 2023.


RESULTS
A total of 42 studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty-four of the included studies reported genetic mutations for a combined 787 patients with SNMM. 8.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 7.6-8.6), 18.9% (95% CI: 18.1-19.8), and 8.5% (95% CI: 8.1-9.0) of reported patients were positive for BRAF, NRAS, and KIT mutations, respectively. The presence of brisk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was associated with improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival (OS). Six studies reported a combined 5-year OS after adjuvant immunotherapy treatment of 42.6% (95% CI: 39.4-45.8). Thirteen studies encompassing 117 patients reported adjuvant or salvage immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) immunotherapy response rates: 40.2% (95% CI: 36.8-43.6) had a positive response (tumor volume reduction or resolution). Eleven studies reported direct comparisons between SNMM patients treated with or without immunotherapy; the majority (7/11) reported survival benefit for their entire cohort or select subgroups of SNMM patients. With the transition to modern ICIs, there is a stronger trend toward survival improvement with adjuvant ICI. Tumors with Ki67 <40% may respond better to ICI's.

To achieve this, the Federal Government launched the Na�onal Vaccina�on Movement and the 'Health with Science' pla�orm to comb at vaccine misinforma�on, promoted Microplanning, providing tools for decision -making at the territorial level, allocated 30 million dollars to states and municipali�es to implement innova�ve vaccina�on strategies, standardized the rules of the informa �on systems for the registra�on of vaccine doses, and directed data to the Na�onal Health Data Network (RNDS). Reversing the declining trend of vaccina�on coverage in Brazil is challenging, but within just one year, it is possible to observe signiﬁcant results from governmental ac�ons. Out of the eight recommended vaccines by the age of one, seven showed an increase in vaccina�on coverage in 2023 compared to 2022: Most states showed improvements in vaccina�on coverage.

265d200676743daab66c99ae707add0930819b3a,The Progress and Future of Artificial Intelligence in Nursing Care: A Review,"
 
 The utilization of novel technologies in contemporary times not only reduces the cost associated with healthcare but also improves the efficiency of hospital resources and elevates the standard of medical assistance. One of the new technologies used in the field of health is Artificial Intelligence (AI). The purpose of this study is to investigate the application of AI in the field of nursing.
 
 
 
 
 The present investigation was conducted in the year 2023 utilizing a review methodology and an innovative scientific inquiry. Comprehensive research was performed in reliable databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Springer, using the keywords AI, smart hospital, nursing, and health care to accomplish the intended objectives. From 2016 to 2023,120 articles were chosen as the initial selection. Studies that were not related to the subject matter were excluded from the analysis afterward.
 
 
 
 
 
 After searching and eliminating duplicate articles through objective screening, a total of 98 articles were reviewed, with 63 ultimately selected for the study. Within the realm of nursing care, research has been conducted in various areas, such as electronic health records (13 studies), health information collection and analysis (27 studies), healthcare cost analysis (16 studies), and the implementation of smart technology and hospitals (7 studies). The integration of AI technology has shown promise in enhancing nursing care by reducing diagnostic errors, improving emergency response times, improving patient care quality and psychological support, and enabling remote care for elderly patients through the use of smart technology.
 
 
 
 
 AI is a significant technological advancement that can directly impact the operational effectiveness of healthcare organizations. This is achieved through the optimization of healthcare business processes and the enhancement of patient safety. However, limited research has been conducted regarding the affordability and economic aspects of AI implementation. Therefore, it is advisable for healthcare policymakers to establish the necessary infrastructure to leverage this technology, which will facilitate a more effective therapeutic and economic approach.

12942e93ba2d85d5660bdfbdd88388d832a17188,"Heading in football: a systematic review of descriptors, definitions, and reporting methods used in heading incidence studies.","The primary objective of this systematic review was to describe the number and type of heading descriptors used in all published studies which report on heading incidence in football. The secondary objective was to detail the data collection and reporting methods used in the included studies to present heading incidence data. Eligible studies were identified through searches of five electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science, using a combination of free-text keywords (inception to 12th September 2023). Manual searching of reference lists and retrieved systematic reviews was also performed. A descriptive overview and synthesis of the results is presented. From 1620 potentially eligible studies, 71 studies were included, with the following key findings: 1) only 61% of studies defined a header with even fewer (23%) providing an operational definition of a header within the methods; 2) important study and player demographic data including year and country were often not reported; 3) reported heading descriptors and their coding options varied greatly; 4) visual identification of headers was essential when inertial measurement units were used to collect heading incidence data; and 5) there was a lack of standardisation in the reporting methods used in heading incidence studies making comparison between studies challenging. To address these findings, the development of a standardised, internationally supported, operational definition of a header and related heading descriptors should be prioritised. Further recommendations include the development of minimum reporting criteria for heading incidence research.",Science and medicine in football,2024.0,4,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/24733938.2024.2362191?needAccess=true', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/24733938.2024.2362191?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/24733938.2024.2362191, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0f8270087aebb53dcd6b9a604f3154a91deac51e,Polyphenol supplementation boosts aerobic endurance in athletes: systematic review,"In recent years, an increasing trend has been observed in the consumption of specific polyphenols, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, derived from green tea, berries, and other similar sources. These compounds are believed to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation resulting from exercise, potentially enhancing athletic performance. This systematic review critically examines the role of polyphenol supplementation in improving aerobic endurance among athletes and individuals with regular exercise habits. The review involved a thorough search of major literature databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus, and Embase, covering re-search up to the year 2023. Out of 491 initially identified articles, 11 met the strict inclusion criteria for this review. These studies specifically focused on the incorporation of polyphenols or polyphenol-containing complexes in their experimental design, assessing their impact on aerobic endurance. The methodology adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool. While this review suggests that polyphenol supplementation might enhance certain aspects of aerobic endurance and promote fat oxidation, it is important to interpret these findings with caution, considering the limited number of studies available.

Methods The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched for all literature on the effectiveness on urinary control after radical prostate cancer between the date of database creation and 15 November 2023 and performed a quality assessment. A network meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 17.0 software and evaluated using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Results The results of the network meta-analysis showed that pelvic floor muscle therapy including biofeedback with professional therapist–guided treatment demonstrated better results at 1 month to 6 months; electrical stimulation, biofeedback, and professional therapist guidance may be more effective at 3 months of treatment; professional therapist–guided recovery may be less effective at 6 months of treatment; and combined therapy demonstrated better results at 1 year of treatment. During the course of treatment, biofeedback with professional therapist–guided treatment may have significant therapeutic effects in the short term after surgery, but, in the long term, the combination of multiple treatments (pelvic floor muscle training+ routine care + biofeedback + professional therapist–guided treatment + electrical nerve stimulation therapy) may address cases of urinary incontinence that remain unrecovered long after surgery. Conclusion In general, all treatment methods improve the different stages of functional recovery of the pelvic floor muscles. However, in the long term, there are no significant differences between the treatments. Given the cost-effectiveness, pelvic floor muscle training + routine care + biofeedback + professional therapist–guided treatment + electrical nerve stimulation therapy within 3 months and pelvic floor muscle + routine care after 3 months may be a more economical option to treat urinary incontinence.

In the qualitative aspect, the study conducted semistructured interviews for data collection. In the experimental group, the flipped classroom (FC) model and an instructional design are combined to design, develop and implement a physics course using the steps of the EDP, while the conventional method was applied to the control group. The respondents are students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Cao Thang Technical College in Vietnam for the academic year 2022–2023. The control and experimental groups are composed of 80 students each. An independent sample Mann–Whitney U test is applied to the quantitative data, while thematic analysis is employed for the qualitative data.FindingsThe results demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of perceptions about learning science and physics using the EDP, which, when combined with a FC, enhances physics learning for engineering students.Research limitations/implications This study implemented the EDP in teaching physics to first-year engineering students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering using the combined FC and instructional design models. The results revealed that a difference exists in the perception of the students in terms of integrating the EDP into learning physics between the experimental and control groups. The experimental group, which underwent the EDP, obtained better results than did the control group, which used the conventional method. The results demonstrated that the EDP encouraged the students to explore and learn new content knowledge by selecting the appropriate solution to the problem. The EDP also helped them integrate new knowledge and engineering skills into mechanical engineering. This research also introduced a new perspective on physics teaching and learning using the EDP for engineering college students.Practical implicationsThe research findings are important for teaching and learning physics using EDP in the context of engineering education.

58b172d447cab9a3124574015719d3deb711ed22,Extracellular vesicles as a new frontier of diagnostic biomarkers in osteosarcoma diseases: a bibliometric and visualized study,"The use of liquid biopsy in cancer research has grown exponentially, offering potential for early detection, treatment stratification, and monitoring residual disease and recurrence. Exosomes, released by cancer cells, contain tumor-derived materials and are stable in biofluids, making them valuable biomarkers for clinical evaluation. Bibliometric research on osteosarcoma (OS) and exosome-derived diagnostic biomarkers is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a bibliometric evaluation of studies on OS and exosome-derived biomarkers. Using the Web of Science Core Collection database, Microsoft Excel, the R “Bibliometrix” package, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer software, quantitative analyses of the country, author, annual publications, journals, institutions, and keywords of studies on exosome-derived biomarkers for OS from 1995 to 2023 were performed. High-quality records (average citation rate ≥ 10/year) were filtered. The corresponding authors were mainly from China, the USA, Australia, and Canada. The University of Kansas Medical Center, National Cancer Center, Japan, and University of Kansas were major institutions, with limited cooperation reported by the University of Kansas Medical Center. Keyword analysis revealed a shift from cancer progression to mesenchymal stem cells, exosome expression, biogenesis, and prognostic biomarkers. Qualitative analysis highlighted exosome cargo, including miRNAs, circRNAs, lncRNAs, and proteins, as potential diagnostic OS biomarkers.

Aside from cognitive skills, the non-cognitive skills are believed to play a crucial role for academic success as they can improve student motivation, engagement, and overall well-being. This study examined the correlation of non-cognitive skills to academic performance among students at General Luna National High School, Siargao Islands, Surigao del Norte, Philippines. The main tools used to gather information were an adapted research questionnaire for Grades 11 and 12 students. The study respondents were the 302 senior high school students under the general academic strand at General Luna National High School during the school year 2022 – 2023. Data gathered were analyzed using Frequency Count and Percentage, Means and Standard Deviations, Mann Whitney U-Test and Kruskal Wallis H-Test, Independent T-Test, and Spearman Rho Correlation to yield a generally significant difference and relationship based on the data outcomes from the respondents’ responses.The descriptive-correlational research design was used to evaluate the non-cognitive skills in the learning of senior high school students that link to their academic achievement in which purposive sampling was done to obtain 302 respondents. Results showed that the respondents still need assistance writing high-quality research papers and more confidence especially when collaborating with teachers in doing class projects even outside the class. Majority of them (64%) got a grade point average below 85% which implies a need to demonstrate a higher degree of academic performance. With p-values of 0.0001 and 0.0120, significant differences exist in the respondents’ academic performance when grouped based on sex and grade level, respectively. Furthermore, with correlation coefficient of 0.29 and p-value of 0.0001, it was revealed that there is a significant positive relationship between the respondents’ academic achievement and non-cognitive skills in terms of academic perseverance. These findings provide several implications especially in enhancing students’ academic achievement for low performing subject areas such as science and mathematics. Hence, it is recommended that teachers and school administrators may consider providing activities or programs to strengthen students’ academic perseverance to improve their performance across all subject areas, most especially in writing research.",International journal of science and management studies,2024.0,2,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.51386/25815946/ijsms-v7i1p131', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.51386/25815946/ijsms-v7i1p131?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.51386/25815946/ijsms-v7i1p131, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This article provides a narrative review summarizing the various linking mechanisms and the nature of association between two multifactorial diseases—periodontitis and migraine. Materials and Methods A literature search was performed for articles related to periodontitis and migraine up till the year 2023 which yielded totally 14 articles. There were only three randomized controlled clinical trials; therefore, we were unable to conduct a systematic review and focused on a narrative review. The keywords searched were “migraine”, “periodontitis” and “biomarkers” in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Embase databases. Any article related to the association of periodontitis and migraine and the dental management of subjects with headache disorders were included and studies with migraine and other dental diseases were excluded. Results It is found that the occurrence of periodontitis and migraine are associated with each other. There is reasonable evidence to believe that periodontitis and migraine are linked by direct and indirect mechanisms which can eventually lead to chronic inflammatory conditions like periodontitis worsening neurovascular conditions such as migraine. However, upon detailed analysis it was found that the strength of association is weak owing to the presences of various common confounding and risk factors. Conclusions The association between periodontitis and migraine cannot be denied, however, not all the criteria are fulfilled while examining the nature of association and future long-term studies are required to prove the same. Clinical Relevance. Various studies have reported poor periodontal health in patients with migraine. The risk of exacerbation of migraine also increases in subject undergoing dental therapy if the triggering factors are manipulated.

d1e676a50ee5fda1110a08aa4168a04ccd27194e,Global scientific production on gasless laparoscopy: a bibliometric analysis,"Objectives To characterize the bibliometric characteristics of the global scientific production of original research on gasless laparoscopy in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) platform. Materials and methods A bibliometric study of original articles published up to the year 2023 was carried out. Articles were included following the selection criteria in the Rayyan web application, indexed in the Scopus database. The bibliometric analysis was performed using the Bibliometrix program in the R programming language and VOSviewer. The bibliometric characteristics evaluated were articles, journals, citations, publications, ten most mentioned articles, journals with the highest number of publications, authors and institutional affiliations; and cooccurrence of terms. Results A total of 223 publications were included, with the highest number of articles being published in the years 1999 and 2014. The publication with the most citations was found to be a randomized trial by Galizia G in 2001 with 132 citations. We identified 846 authors involved in the production of articles on gasless laparoscopy, with Nakamura H being the most productive author with 15 articles between the years 2007 and 2020, followed by Takeda A and Imoto S, all three affiliated with “Gifu Prefectural Tajimi Hospital”. The country with the highest production was Japan with 64 publications, followed by China and Italy with 46 and 18 publications, respectively. In the top 10 journals with the highest number of publications, “Surgical Endoscopy—Ultrasound and Interventional Techniques” is in first place with 20 articles published on gasless laparoscopy; in addition, most of these are located in Q1 and Q2. Regarding the terms or keywords, it was found that the initial studies had terms related to the disadvantages of pneumoperitoneum and later focused on more specific topics of the application of gasless laparoscopy. Conclusions Production on gasless laparoscopy has stagnated, with the topics of interest currently being its application in new, less invasive techniques.

The disease also imposes a severe social and economic burden on households and health systems and is strongly associated with poverty. This study summarizes the most up-to-date cost of treating severe malaria in children in Africa. Methods A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, and Web of Science databases. Google and Google Scholar were searched for grey literature followed by scanning of the reference lists of the previous systematic reviews. The search was limited to children < 12 years, malaria-endemic countries in Africa, and the English language. All costs were adjusted to the year 2023. Results 19 studies conducted in 12 countries were identified: 14 reported provider costs, and 11 household costs. Out of the 19 studies found, 11 were published before 2018 while 11 reported data that are currently more than ten years old. Studies varied methodologically and in the scope of resources included to estimate the cost. The provider costs ranged from USD 27 in Uganda to USD 165 per patient in Kenya (median value USD 90), while household costs ranged from USD 13 in Kenya to USD 245 per patient in Gabon (median value USD 50). All identified household malaria treatment costs except one represented catastrophic health expenditure, making out more than 10% of the monthly Gross National Income per capita in the respective countries. Conclusion Evidence on the cost of treating severe malaria in children in Africa is scarce. However, the few existing studies show that severe malaria in children imposes a significant economic burden on the providers and households. More studies are needed, particularly in high-burden high-impact countries, to inform resource allocation decisions.

df12a30d14bb17f9782e4282ebfe2015a49d4095,"Development of the State Scientific Certification System in Russia within the Independent Academic Degree Award Principles: Tools, Outcomes, and Future Steps","Introduction. In Russia, 2023 has been declared the Year of the Educator and Mentor, emphasizing the need for systematic measures in the field of personnel development for the research and development sector, primarily through postgraduate education. The necessity to ensure the stability of the research and development sector arises due to new objectives of the government policy on scientific and technological development, including training personnel in priority fields and enhancing science management. Over the past decade, scientific periodicals have extensively discussed ways to improve the effectiveness of postgraduate studies, given the decline in researcher numbers and dissertation defense rates, stricter requirements for dissertation councils, and their evolving operational forms. This article attempts to explore the role of mentorship in science within the context of the scientific and technological development objectives set by the country's leadership. The study highlights trends in scientific mentorship development and defines its functions based on survey data from research advisors working in Russian universities and research organizations. The study identifies contradictions that need to be addressed and proposes ways to improve the work and status of research advisors. Methods. The empirical foundation of this study is based on a sociological survey of postgraduate students and applicants' research advisors with a candidate or doctoral degree — academic, scientific, and administrative and managerial personnel of universities and research organizations (N = 3000). The survey included representatives from all broad scientific fields (natural, technical, humanities, social, medical, agricultural). The survey was conducted in 2023. Results and Discussion. The study results reveal that the main challenges research advisors face when working with applicants for academic degrees are organizational and competence-related, tied to the high level of bureaucratization in scientific personnel training, lack of flexibility, insufficient time allocation, and poor competencies of the participants in this process, especially those responsible for scientific and technological development. The study notes an increase in the complexity of the functional roles of research advisors due to an outdated workload distribution system that hinders full participation in scientific personnel training to meet current demands. Research advisors believe they require specialized training and describe the current state of scientific personnel training as being in crisis, necessitating significant changes. The study identifies several directions for modernizing higher qualification personnel training to address scientific and technological development challenges: aligning postgraduate training with practical experience (transitioning to professional and industrial postgraduate education in experimental mode for certain fields); creating individualized tracks for dissertation preparation (implementing individual programs); conducting internships at enterprises oriented at knowledge-driven economy and academic mobility improvement; appointing consultants from companies alongside research advisors, etc. The study results are discussed in terms of gender, age, job differences, and affiliation to a specific field of science. Conclusion. The study suggests that adopting a hybrid model of scientific mentorship, which combines elements of the traditional model (the research advisor being the sole mentor) and other models (developmental mentorship, multiple mentors, supportive mentorship) prevalent in international practice, could help address certain organizational and competence-related issues. To enhance the benefits of postgraduate studies for the high-tech sector, special attention should be paid to natural and technical sciences, interdisciplinary research, dissertations commissioned by the industry, organizations, or companies, joint supervision models, and strengthening ties between universities, research organizations, and the economy sector itself among others.",Science Governance and Scientometrics,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33873/2686-6706.2024.19-1.10-65?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33873/2686-6706.2024.19-1.10-65, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 This review essay focuses on how the year’s work in new materialism builds on a vibrant discourse in literary studies and nascent, growing trends in postcolonial and indigenous new materialisms. A variety of new materialist works published in 2023, from the monographs Earthly Things: Immanence, New Materialisms, and Planetary Thinking and The Garden Politic: Global Plants and Botanical Nationalism in Nineteenth-Century America, to the journal article ‘New Materialism and Posthumanism in Roman Archaeology’, explore the ways in which the pillars of new materialist thought, such as the agentic capacity of vibrant matter, ‘speaking objects’, and entanglement, can lead to decolonial revelations about human culture and history. The essay is grouped according to common themes addressed in this year’s body of work: 1. Introduction; 2. Literature and Beyond; 3. Colonial Plants and Enslaved Objects; 4. New Materialism and Eco-Marxism; 5. Immanence and Planetary Thinking; 6. New (Materialist) Topics of Conversation in Science; and 7. Conclusion. The varied scholarship surveyed points to the conclusion that what was once seen as new materialism’s ethical weakness—its focus on matter over human beings—is now becoming a decolonial strength.",The Year s Work in Critical and Cultural Theory,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/ywcct/mbae012?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/ywcct/mbae012, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We also then proceed to summarize our paper on racism and the ‘Comprehensive sociocultural persecution complex’ which was postulated as a logical extension and a practical application of the aforesaid certainty uncertainty principle for the social sciences. We also propose and examine other possible extensions of the certainty uncertainty principle such as the examination of the Flynn effect, the idea of qualified historiography, and the out of Africa theory, the multiregional hypothesis for the origin of anatomically modern humans, besides several others. We also present and propose a formula for attempting probabilistic approaches for hypothesis evaluation, and evaluate and recommend techniques for evaluating strength or weaknesses of evidence. We also correlate this paper with our various previous papers as necessary, and propose the principle and canon of non self-canceling contradictory evidence.

e800f729d2c1909eac51097442348eaa2cdb8ad1,Digital Campus as a tool for teaching English in the era of digital education,"                Introduction. The digital transformation of higher education in Russia has caused the need to revise the approaches to language training of university graduates.                Aim. The present research aimed to model a Digital Campus with its services and functions as a tool for language training of students in the era of digital transformation of education.                Methodology and research methods. The strategic approach was employed as the leading methodological approach, which in the framework of this study is considered as a potential possibility to implement language education at the university using the “Digital Campus” as an important tool for digital transformation of universities. The research was conducted in three stages, involving 2–3 year students of Togliatti State University (113 participants) and school students of Togliatti (157 participants) from July 2022 to January 2023. Empirical research methods were used: analysis, comparison, generalisation, synthesis, modelling. Stage 1 – collection and analysis of the information presented on the websites of the universities in order to highlight the indicators of the digital development of universities. Stage 2 – a survey of schoolchildren to identify their attitude to university admission; a survey of students to determine their motivation to receive language training through digital tools. Stage 3 – modelling of a Digital Campus, its services and functions for students’ language training.                Results. The authors defined the Digital Campus as an environment based on information and educational digital resources and technologies, computer equipment, telecommunication technologies and software, organisational and methodological support, connecting participants in the learning process (teachers, applicants and students, graduates, enterprises/businesses) for distant educational activities and business operations in accordance with personalised request. The data available on universities’ websites were analysed and grouped into seven indicators. The most represented are the services: additional professional education, the use of interactive forms to work with applicants, online support of student and graduate career development, and the project office. Services for the implementation of personalised educational tracks and the digital footprints accumulation during the learning process were less prominent in the course of the research. The results of the survey were the following: there was a general readiness for “applicant – university” interaction through the online environment; a small percentage of divergence of schoolchildren and student opinion regarding their expectations to learn a foreign language online was observed. The Digital Campus and its functions were modelled. Each of the campus services – a student personal account (applicants/students), a teacher personal account, and an employer personal account (enterprises/businesses) – has its own interface and access to the following functional units: “Recruitment and Project System”, “Language Courses”, “Course Designer”, “Resource Management”, “E-Learning System”, “Courses Expertise Centre”. The environment creates unified information and educational space for student language training.                Scientific novelty. The approaches to understanding the digital transformation of higher education were systematised, and the indicators of higher education institutions use of digital solutions in the educational process were analytically presented. The article provides the authors’ definition of the Digital Campus. The theoretical significance of the article is in the outline and analytical presentation of existing approaches and trends in the digital transformation of higher education.                Practical significance. The Digital Campus is an important tool for the implementation of language training and, unlike the common university website, allows real-time interaction between all participants in the educational process: universities – students – enterprises/businesses. The prospects for the study may be aimed at the development of a Digital Campus for engineering students.",The Education and science journal,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.edscience.ru/jour/article/download/3486/1205', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17853/1994-5639-2024-1-171-201?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17853/1994-5639-2024-1-171-201, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As per global Road Safety reports drowsy driving was reason for 91,000 road accidents in Tamil Nadu in the year 2023. In this study, I suggest a collective deep learning architecture for automatic driver sleepiness detection while some earlier works are suggested extracting the lips and eyes movements to identify sleepiness, more contemporary computer vision-based systems have performed only somewhat well. This is because they either use extremely large deep learning models with still-poor performance or they use hand-crafted features with traditional methods like K-NN Algotithm and openCV. To overcome such issues in this project I am planing to create a Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alerting System using Mediapipe‘s Face Mesh solution in Python. These systems assess the driver‘s alertness and warn the driver if needed. Continuous driving can be tedious and exhausting. A motorist may get droopy and perhaps nod off due to inactivity. we will create a drowsy driver detection system to address such an issue. For this, we will use Mediapipe‘s Face Mesh solution in python and the Eye Aspect ratio formula using by Navie Bayes Algorithm.

5ae9f9c47902a83ef3741b0f211b3b110aa7bed0,2024 update in heart failure,"Abstract In the last years, major progress has occurred in heart failure (HF) management. The 2023 ESC focused update of the 2021 HF guidelines introduced new key recommendations based on the results of the last years of science. First, two drugs, sodium–glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and finerenone, a novel nonsteroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), are recommended for the prevention of HF in patients with diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD). Second, SGLT2 inhibitors are now recommended for the treatment of HF across the entire left ventricular ejection fraction spectrum. The benefits of quadruple therapy in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are well established. Its rapid and early up‐titration along with a close follow‐up with frequent clinical and laboratory re‐assessment after an episode of acute HF (the so‐called ‘high‐intensity care’ strategy) was associated with better outcomes in the STRONG‐HF trial. Patients experiencing an episode of worsening HF might require a fifth drug, vericiguat. In the STEP‐HFpEF‐DM and STEP‐HFpEF trials, semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly administered for 1 year decreased body weight and significantly improved quality of life and the 6 min walk distance in obese patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with or without a history of diabetes. Further data on safety and efficacy, including also hard endpoints, are needed to support the addition of acetazolamide or hydrochlorothiazide to a standard diuretic regimen in patients hospitalized due to acute HF. In the meantime, PUSH‐AHF supported the use of natriuresis‐guided diuretic therapy. Further options and most recent evidence for the treatment of HF, including specific drugs for cardiomyopathies (i.e., mavacamten in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and tafamidis in transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis), device therapies, cardiac contractility modulation and percutaneous treatment of valvulopathies, with the recent finding from the TRILUMINATE Pivotal trial, are also reviewed in this article.",ESC Heart Failure,2024.0,28,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ehf2.14857', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11769673, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

212c3a1de2e864ff16972575bff769ee9ec5bd08,Piloting a Diagnostic Tool to Measure AP CS Principles Teachers' Knowledge Against CSTA Teacher Standard 1,"Problem. Understanding computer science (CS) teacher CS knowledge primarily relies on self-reported data from participants to understand the learning impact on teachers and improve teacher growth. There is currently a lack of quality instruments to determine where CS teachers need to improve their knowledge. Research Question. Our research question for this project was: What are the preliminary psychometric properties of a developed measure for AP CS Principles teachers? Methodology. We developed and piloted a diagnostic tool for high school teachers (n=18) who have been or will be engaged in teaching AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). We then administered the diagnostic with two groups of teachers at the CSTA PD week in 2023, and analyzed the results. Findings. The full 22-item measure demonstrated acceptable reliability (alpha = 0.74) in the present sample. However, four items were identified as ""low performing"" based on low discrimination values. Further, despite the adequate reliability of the full scale, reliability of the individual subscales was lower (0.29-0.54). This may have been caused by low sample size and/or the lower number of items included at the subscale level. Implications. As a pilot, our analysis of the diagnostic indicated that reliability can be improved by revising certain items. We will use this information to revise these items, then pilot the diagnostic again next year with a larger set of teachers. This diagnostic can then be used by CSTA and the broader CS education community for their repertoire of tools designed to inform professional development topics and practices.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3626252.3630905', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'other-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3626252.3630905?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3626252.3630905, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This research employed a correlational design using structural equation modeling (SEM). The study population included all secondary school teachers in Mazandaran Province with academic backgrounds in various educational disciplines, educational psychology, counseling, sociology, political science, theology, and Islamic studies who were active in the academic year 2023–2024. To estimate the sample size, Cochran's formula was used, and considering a 20% attrition rate, the final sample consisted of 320 participants selected randomly. To assess the construct validity of the proposed model, first-order and second-order confirmatory factor analyses were conducted using AMOS24 software. Additionally, the paradigmatic model of the study was analyzed using structural equation modeling with a partial least squares approach (PLS-3 software). Regression coefficients for direct effects were reported for all model pathways. Based on the findings, the standardized factor loadings for each primary and secondary dimension of the multidimensional education model aimed at enhancing academic performance with emphasis on social-political, psychological, and spiritual-moral development exceeded 0.40, confirming their validity. The convergent and divergent validity of the proposed model's scales was also appropriate. Furthermore, the overall model fit was confirmed, demonstrating that both the structural and measurement models effectively explained the study variables. Thus, implementing the model developed in this research for multidimensional education to enhance academic performance, with an emphasis on social-political, psychological, and spiritual-moral development in secondary school students, is an effective and highly valid approach.

2247403258d20c2e8e99f84920372e1db094b6b6,"RESEARCH ARTICLE RETRACTION: CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES","Evil of publishing fraudulent medical research papers has become prevalent. Last year (2023) the annual number of papers retracted by research journals topped 10,000 for the first time. Retractions are typically made in cases of scientific misconduct, data fabrication or falsification, plagiarism, or other serious ethical violations. Retractions are important for maintaining the integrity and credibility of scientific literature, as they help to correct the scientific record and prevent the dissemination of inaccurate or misleading information. The publication of sham science papers has its roots in some countries where young doctors and scientists seeking promotion were required to have published scientific papers. Research article writing should not be mandatory for medical teachers working at the undergraduate level. Allowing medical teachers to pursue research on a voluntary or optional basis will contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge without compromising on quality of research and it will ultimately result in a smaller number of retractions.

bb99b5769a0f187127d82d617550b6e1711c718a,THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND THE DEATH PUNISHMENT AS ITS DEROGATION,"Although in developed countries (many these countries) the existence of the death penalty is no longer questioned, nor is there a dilemma regarding this penalty in modern legislation, the reports of international organizations that monitor this phenomenon are worrying. According to the latest reports, in the year 2023, 1,153 death sentences were carried out in the world, which shows that even though the number of countries abolishing this punishment is increasing, the number of executed death sentences, accordingly, should be decreasing, but it is not. In addition, new methods of execution of the death penalty are being introduced, which shows that there is no intention to abolish it, although international acts require such an obligation. This was a signal to the authors of the paper to try to explain the concept of the death penalty and the issues related to it that arise in science, practice, religion, morality, and increasingly in society from a scientific and professional perspective. The main scientific goal of the work is to understand the reasons for the introduction, and still exist, of the death penalty in certain countries, as well as to find modalities of punishment that are an adequate substitute for the death penalty and to achieve fairness and proportionality in punishment. In the research, almost all basic methods of knowledge and research were applied, and statistical and comparative methods were used from the general scientific methods, while from the methods for data collection, only the method of content analysis of documents, laws and annual statistical reports of the Republic Institute of Statistics was used. Using the historical-comparative method, in the first part of the work, the authors dealt with the historical aspects of the origin of this punishment, its morphoses, as well as its disappearance from most legislation. After that, we carry out a detailed analysis of the application of the death penalty on the territory of Serbia, today’s Republic of Serbia, but also in the world. The work ends with the discovery of perspectives related to the death penalty, its abolition, but also its reintroduction in some countries or changing the methods by which it is carried out, which is widely debated in society today. This is exactly what explains the social goal of the work, which consists in proving the harmfulness/benefit of the executed death penalty on the increase/decrease of criminality in society and its moral, religious, medical and legal justification. The death penalty has its alternatives and can be very effectively replaced by some other punishments that would also justify the purpose of punishment. For example, the introduction of life imprisonment (with or without the possibility of parole or some other variation) is one of many alternatives to the death penalty. Although life imprisonment has its advantages and disadvantages, and it is not the most ideal, at least it has the possibility of “correcting a mistake” if a mistake occurs in the court proceedings, it is more humane and allows convicted persons to have at least some hope that one day they will be free again (life imprisonment with the possibility of parole) which is already a step forward in the development of humanity. If, even after all the arguments presented, there is doubt as to whether the death penalty should be included in the legislation or not, it is only necessary to answer the research question: has crime and illegal behavior been eradicated in countries that have the death penalty, and has its application had a good effect to reduce criminal activity? The answer is: No! Therefore, the conclusion is that the purpose for which the death penalty was introduced was not achieved.",SCIENCE International Journal,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.35120/sciencej0303081l?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.35120/sciencej0303081l, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 Introduction In-utero experience of violence through maternal experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes via ‘biological programming,’ whose effect can be mediated by sleep. We conducted a scoping review to synthesize the current evidence of the association between experiences of violence and sleep in women.
 Methods Between August and October 2023, we conducted a search in four databases (PubMed, APA PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science) for peer-reviewed articles, using 11 inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any study published in English in peer-reviewed journals that conducted original research on the association between exposure to violence (lifetime IPV, IPV during the previous year, during and 1 year after pregnancy, as well as adverse childhood experiences) and poor sleep outcomes (sleep disturbances, insomnia, poor sleep quality, and longer time to fall asleep) in the perinatal population were included.
 Results The synthesis of the 12 included studies revealed a positive association between exposure to violence and poor sleep, and between adverse childhood experiences and sleep disturbances or poor sleep during pregnancy. Moreover, IPV in the postpartum period was associated with poor sleep.
 Conclusion Most of the evidence synthesized comprises data from high-income countries, resulting in lack of cultural context. However, it is evident that the experience of violence throughout life is a risk for poor perinatal sleep quality. Thus, there is a growing need to study this association, especially in resource-limited settings, where data on sleep health is largely absent, inform pregnancy care and maternal and child health policies.",Sleep Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0044-1791237', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1055/s-0044-1791237?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0044-1791237, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Abstract: The Prebiotic Task Force of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) Europe advances the science and understanding of prebiotics and their health benefits. The Task Force, comprising academic advisors and numerous industry scientists, aims to provide scientific evidence to support the development of prebiotic-containing foods and dietary supplements that can improve gut health and overall wellbeing. Last year, the Task Force published several (peer-reviewed) scientific papers: (1) a concise monograph, translated into seven languages, providing a user-friendly introduction to the abundant scientific knowledge on prebiotics, probiotics and the gut microbiota and their impact on human health; (2) a narrative review, providing an overview of the role of non-digestible carbohydrates in the human diet, their impact on the gut microbiota, and their potential as prebiotics, with a particular emphasis on structure-related activities and in vitro models; (3) a perspective review, describing state-of-the-art tools for harnessing the microbiome for precision health, such as pro-and prebiotic dietary solutions amongst others, and a corresponding future vision of healthcare; and (4) perspectives on what we know, what we need to investigate, and how to put knowledge into practice in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Currently, the role of prebiotics in bacterial and viral infections and vaccination efficiency is being systematically reviewed. The review will give the current status for prebiotics impact on infections, both prevention or recovery, and in supporting vaccination efficacy, for academics and industry scientists in this field. The Task Force will also commence activity on highlighting the need to perform studies in healthy participants that test the potential “rescuing” effects of prebiotics under conditions where cognition may be transiently compromised. In addition, a multi-stakeholder workshop to discuss evidence for microbiome modulation and physiological pathways for improved health and reduced disease risk, that may support a roadmap for future health claim substantiation, is being initiated this year.",The 14th European Nutrition Conference FENS 2023,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/proceedings2023091318?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/proceedings2023091318, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study examines the key topics and the target audiences detailed in papers submitted to the ATCM on E&O. Since the Antarctic Treaty entered into force in 1961, a total of 216 ATCM papers on E&O have been produced. The number of papers has increased substantially since the mid-1990s. ‘Science’ (76.9%) and ‘Wildlife/Biodiversity/Environment’ (75.5%) were the most addressed topics in these papers, while the ‘Public’ (81.0%) and those attending ‘Schools’ (69.0%) are the main target audiences. ‘Science’ in ATCM papers increased ~120-fold from 1961–1997 to 2015–2023, while ATCM papers discussing engagement with the ‘Public’ increased ~40-fold during the same period. ‘Climate change’ was first mentioned in 2006, and the number of papers per year increased fourfold by 2015–2023. This study shows the increasing interest in E&O through time, addressing key topics to relevant audiences related to the Antarctic region.

ff37063a93229433d92652a95b6eec5b6c06bfb4,Beyond Trial and Error: A Comprehensive Classification of Metaheuristics along with Metaphor Criterion Development Trend,"Objectives: The research aims to develop a comprehensive classification system for metaheuristics, categorize metaphor metaheuristics, and present the development trend and percentage representation of metaphor metaheuristics within each metaphor group. Method: A descriptive-based systematic review was conducted to collect data on studies concerning the classification of metaheuristics and the proposal of new metaheuristics. Data was sourced from Google Scholar, Science Direct, Springer, ResearchGate, and IEEE Xplore. For the first research objective, 148 studies were screened, resulting in the selection of six studies. The second and third research objectives involved screening 1145 studies, of which 654 were ultimately selected. This review considers studies published up to August 2023. The extracted data includes the characteristics of each classification and the name, abbreviation, author, year, and metaphor group for each metaheuristic reviewed. Findings: The results reveal that existing classifications do not cover the full range of metaheuristic characteristics. The data indicates a rising trend in the introduction of new metaheuristics over the years, with the peak occurring in 2020, boasting 68 new approaches, closely followed by 2022 with 57 introductions. However, between 1965 and 1992, progress was limited to only one or two new approaches annually, signifying periods of stagnation in the field. The majority of metaheuristics proposed are in the physics-chemistry metaphor group (20%), followed closely by human metaheuristics (18%). Novelty: The novelty of this study lies in its exhaustive classification of metaheuristics developed from 1965 to August 2023 based on the metaphor criterion, along with the development progression and percentage-wise representation of various metaphor groups using up-to-date data.

This study aimed to determine the significant relationship of the parental support and students’ academic performance in Dao Elementary School, Sta. Josefa District during the academic year of 2022-2023. Specifically, this study sought to determine the level of engagement of parents on the school activities, attitude of parents toward school activities, and academic performance of the students in Math; English; and Science. The study was conducted to 130 parents and 148 learners. The descriptive survey method of research was employed using a modified questionnaire for gathering the data. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance and Pearson coefficient correlation were the statistical tools used to analyze the data. The results revealed that attitude towards school activities with an overall mean rating is 3.92 (SD=0.85) and is described as Strongly Agree, on parental engagement was not significant because it is greater than the significant value of 0.05 while English subject got 87.08. These respondents viewed their support in their children’s education is an integral component to the success of their children. They are aware that their responsibilities go beyond feeding and raising their children also to give a good access to quality education. Parental Engagement had a significant relationship on the academic performances of the students in English and Science but not in Math. There can be other factors that have significant bearing to their academic performance in these areas. This includes students’ motivation, peer influence, home and learning environment. Elementary learners are not mature enough to do well in their studies and are more goal-oriented even with or without full parental support. It is recommended that school administrators and stakeholders should continue in strengthening their relationships for the betterment of students and the community in general.

In the light of the findings obtained in the research, it can be said that the Life Sciences books taught in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd grades of primary school are not sufficient to provide students with environmental awareness. When all the books at these three levels are examined, all themes other than the visual field have not been sufficiently processed and emphasized. At the same time, no activity was found in the books examined that would raise students to the practical level of environmental awareness. Depending on the findings obtained from the research, our suggestions include that the prepared life sciences textbooks should be rearranged on the subject of ""environmental awareness and sensitivity"" and include activities that will raise the students to the application level, and that these activities should be treated as a common theme not only in the life sciences book but in all courses.

This research aims to increase students' interest in learning science in class III through the Team Games Tournament (TGT) model at SD Negeri 007 Rokan IV Koto. This research was motivated by the low interest in learning of class III students for the 2023/2024 academic year, consisting of 13 students consisting of 6 male students and 7 female students. This research was conducted in two cycles, each cycle consisting of two meetings. Data collection in this research used instruments in the form of questionnaires, observation sheets on students' learning interests and interview sheets. Based on the results of data analysis, it can be seen that there is an increase in students' interest in learning in science subjects. Before the action, the completeness of students' learning interest results only reached 36.77%. Then in cycle I, meeting 1 increased to 40.38%, in cycle I, meeting 2, it increased to 45.42%, in cycle II, meeting 1, it increased to 56.36%, in cycle II, meeting 2, it increased again to 76.56%. Thus, it can be concluded that using the Team Games Tournament (TGT) model can increase elementary school students' interest in learning.

68af0dc1d7a113b29510cbffd02e6741d10e504e,Economic impact of a clinical pharmacist in the orthopaedic sector: a review of the literature,"Objectives This review of the literature aimed to evaluate the economic impact of a clinical pharmacist in the orthopaedic sector. Methods The review followed the PRISMA recommendations. A bibliographic search was conducted on 23 June 2023 using PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. All articles in French or English with economic data on clinical pharmacy activities in orthopaedics were included. Articles not mentioning the term ‘orthopaedics’ and those published prior to 1990 were excluded. Data from the studies were compiled in an Excel table. A bias analysis using the ROBINS-I Cochrane tool was performed. The methodology of the studies was compared and weighted using the CHEERS and STROBE checklists. Results Among 529 articles initially identified, 10 were included in the review. The cost–benefit ratio of a clinical pharmacist in orthopaedics ranged from 0.47:1 to 28:1. The maximum savings reached US$73 410 /year in the American study and €1 42 356 /year in the French study. For three studies, the cost of a clinical pharmacist was not evaluated. Eight studies showed a positive economic impact. The Dutch study showed a balance and the Danish study showed a negative economic impact of €3442/month. Conclusions This literature review has shown an economic benefit of a clinical pharmacist in the orthopaedic sector despite several biases and methodological limitations. The two studies that did not confirm this benefit only evaluated a limited number of expected benefits. Nevertheless, the economic impact of the clinical pharmacist in the orthopaedic sector seems positive and undervalued.",European Journal of Hospital Pharmacy: Science and Practice,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1136/ejhpharm-2023-003727?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2023-003727, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The problem of low mathematical literacy is caused by low interest in learning about the learning model used. This research aims to determine the increase in mathematical literacy skills through an integrated problem-based learning (PBL) model of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The research method used was quasi experiment. The population in this research were two classes of students from class XI in one upper secondary school, in the even semester of the 2022/2023 academic year. The research results show that learning with the STEM integrated PBL model is able to improve students' mathematical literacy skills. This can be seen from the average N-Gain in the experimental class of 0.68 in the medium category, while the control class obtained an average N-Gain of 0.22 in the low category. The average N-Gain is supported by the results of the independent sample t-test hypothesis test, with a Sig (2-tailed) value of 0.00 < 0.05, meaning that the students' mathematical literacy abilities are significantly different from those in the control class.

Conducted at Mindanao Mission Academy during the 2023-2024 school year, the study utilized 362 Grade 12 students, including 118 males and 184 females, enrolled in the Accountancy, Business, and Management (ABM); Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS); and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) strands. During the work immersion exposure, students were required to complete an 80-hour work immersion at various partner institutions aligned with their strand, performing department-related tasks and working 8 hours a day. The demographic distribution aligns with national trends showing higher female enrolment in secondary education. Work immersion performance was assessed through self-ratings and supervisor ratings, indicating that students generally perceived their performance as outstanding. Notably, males and females differed significantly in self-ratings (p = 0.032), with males rating themselves higher compared to females. However, no significant differences were found in supervisor-rated performance across genders. Pairwise comparisons of self-ratings across strands indicated no significant difference between ABM and HUMSS students, while STEM students rated themselves significantly higher than both ABM and HUMSS students. In contrast, supervisor ratings showed ABM students performing significantly better than HUMSS and STEM students, highlighting a perceived performance hierarchy. The correlation analysis between self-ratings and supervisor ratings (r = -0.008, p = 0.891) revealed no significant linear relationship, indicating that supervisors' perspectives lean towards the company's needs, while students' perspectives lean towards their self-improvements. The findings suggest the need for gender-sensitive educational interventions and strand-specific support to enhance student self-assessment accuracy and work immersion preparedness. Additionally, educators and policymakers can provide a more effective educational experience by preparing students to be career-ready and effective in the workplace.

Research shows that entrepreneurial activity is particularly high in more developed countries. However, the significance of entrepreneurship extends beyond developed nations to encompass less developed ones as well. The role of women in entrepreneurship stands as a pivotal issue requiring examination in the context of economic development and gender equality. Therefore, it is paramount to diversify research on women's entrepreneurship and provide support for studies in this field. The main purpose of this study is to examine and evaluate articles on women’s entrepreneurship in the Web of Science (WoS) database using bibliometric analysis. The study includes 4301 articles on women’s entrepreneurship published in the WoS database between 1990 and 2023. To achieve this goal, the articles were analyzed by year of publication, language, country, and other relevant factors. According to the main results obtained from the study, it was found that the highest number of articles were published in 2022, with the majority of them being written in English. The results of the study have revealed that the number of publications on women’s entrepreneurship in the Turkic republics of Central Asia is significantly inadequate.

Frankenstein's Plants aims to engage both children and the wider public with the work of herbaria, highlighting the Herbarium at RBGE. We first took part in 2019, and continued in 2023 and 2024.
 The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh is a well-known and loved location for visitors and local residents, attracting large numbers of people throughout the year. However, the work of the Herbarium is less well-known and many visitors, including residents, are unaware of the Herbarium collection.
 The aims of the event include:
 
 
 
 Raising awareness of the herbarium at RGBE, and how it is used by scientists globally
 
 
 Educating people on how specimens are made
 
 
 Introducing the idea of a scientific name and how it is constructed
 
 
 
 Raising awareness of the herbarium at RGBE, and how it is used by scientists globally
 Educating people on how specimens are made
 Introducing the idea of a scientific name and how it is constructed
 Frankenstein's Plants takes participants through the 'life' of a specimen, starting with the selection of material for mounting, through to the digitisation of the specimen, contributing to a virtual herbarium. Participants are encouraged to let their imagination go wild and create a monster (or whatever else they feel like) using the material provided. The event is laid out with a series of stations where staff talk through and support each step of the process (Fig. 1).
 The key steps of specimen creation for this event are:
 
 
 
 Select plant material: pressed and dried prior to the event, using flowers and foliage bought from an online florist, alongside material gathered from the gardens at RBGE.
 
 
 Mount the specimen: a pre-printed label is attached to a piece of board. The boards we use are approximately A4, allowing enough room for participants to create their creatures. Gummed tape is used to fix the plant material to the sheets, as a relatively low-mess option. The label provides space for recording the species name, a description and ‘collector’ information. Some locality information and a barcode is prefilled. The details on the label aim to give the participant an idea of the types of data that would typically be recorded when collecting.
 
 
 Name the specimen: participants can create their own name for their specimen. A list of options for the genus and species is provided and consists of both real and made-up genera and species epithets. This is an opportunity for the team to talk about how plants are named using the binomial system, and the importance of Latin names for communicating about life on earth.
 
 
 Describe the specimen: basic botanical terms are provided alongside sketches to get the participants thinking about how species can be described. This step can be modified based on the age of the participant, bringing in more information and technical terms where appropriate.
 
 
 Stamp the specimen: whilst not a key part of the processing of a specimen, it is very much enjoyed by the participants! We have a mix of old stamps that were previously used on specimens that they can choose from.
 
 
 Digitise the specimen: the final step is to take a picture of the specimen. We have a copy stand and DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera to allow the participant to take a photo of their specimen. The participant scans the barcode, which we use for the file name and later to look up the newly-digitised specimen in the virtual herbarium. They then take the photo, using remote shutter release triggered by a fixed mouse. The laptop is connected to a big screen, so everyone can see the image of their specimen.

 Following the event all the images are uploaded to a Flickr gallery, which acts as our virtual herbarium. A link to this gallery is provided on the label, allowing participants to look up their specimen online, as well as providing an approximate count of participants at the event.
 We have members of staff and volunteers from the PhD and MSc cohorts at the RBGE to talk through each step, as well as providing information about the work of the herbarium and Science Division in general. This is a great opportunity for us to engage with the public about our work, especially as the herbarium team has limited regular engagement with the wider public.
 Alongside the event we have a display about the Herbarium, including teaching specimens. The display provides information about the collections, without needing a team member to explain it, although we aim to have a member of staff available. Often, we find it is the parents/guardians of the children who are most interested in this, so it allows us to extend the group of people with whom we are engaging.
 Over the three years we have run the event, we have engaged with over 1,000 'collectors', ranging in age from 3-95 (Fig. 2), comprised of people from Edinburgh and visitors to the garden from farther afield. This figure does not include those additional members of the public who attend the event, as e.g. the parent/guardian of a child, but do not engage in creating a specimen themselves. If we include an estimate of these additional members of the public, the number of people engaged is nearer to 2,000–3,000.
 Feedback, both during the event and post-event, has been exceptional. We have had comments on how engaging the event is, as well as requests to take pictures so that others can run a similar event themselves.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139077', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.139077?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139077, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

eafcd8630fa4650bc521b7f8eef8a619e6e91500,Gastroenteritis Diagnosed at Necropsy: A Review of Cases Spanning a Decade,"

In this study, we conducted a retrospective survey of gastroenteritis diagnosed in carcasses, from 2013 to 2023, at the Necropsy Unit of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.



Data were obtained from the record book, entered into Microsoft Excel sheet, analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS, v.27).



Results revealed that gastroenteritis was diagnosed in 20.5% of the 1052 carcasses. Yearly distribution analysis revealed fluctuations in prevalence, with peaks in 2017 (16.7%), 2018 (14.4%), and 2019 (13.0%). Species distribution analysis indicated higher proportions in canines (46.3%), caprines (31.5%), and ovines (8.3%). Sex-based analysis revealed varied proportions between males and females across different species, with no significant (p>0.05) association found between sex and species. Age distribution analysis revealed higher proportions in younger animals (<1 year) and older animals (>3 years) within specific species, and there was significant (p<0.05) association between age and species.



These findings provide valuable insights into the burden of gastroenteritis in animals, thus, highlighting its temporal variations, species-, sex-, and age-specific differences. This study, therefore, contributes to the advancement of veterinary pathology, and the promotion of animal health and welfare, by improving our understanding of gastroenteritis epidemiology, and informing evidence-based veterinary practices. There is need for veterinary pathologists to develop and implement species-specific diagnostic protocols, and targeted disease management strategies to effectively mitigate the prevalence and impact of gastroenteritis in animal populations.

The experiment was layout in FRBD with three replications and a recommended variety of green gram BM 2003-2 as a test crop along with twelve treatments. The results in nutshell indicated that the growth and yield were significantly influenced by the application of 125% RDP, combined with Aspergillus awamori. The growth parameters viz., plant height, number of leaves & no. of nodules plant-1, significantly increased with application of 125 % RDP, combined with Aspergillus awamori. The combined approach of incorporating phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms, particularly Aspergillus awamori, with the application of 125% RDP, resulted in a noteworthy increase in the availability of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in the soil. This improvement was attributed to the enhanced solubilization of inorganic phosphorus and the secretion of organic acids, which facilitated an increase in the content of other essential nutrients in the soil. The nutrient content in both grain and straw exhibited significant increases due to seed inoculation with Aspergillus awamori in conjunction with the application of 125%RDP. This approach outperformed treatments involving Tricoderma viridae and Bacillus megaterium in combination with 100% RDP, and the control. The incorporation of phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms, particularly Aspergillus awamori, alongside the application of 125% RDP, proved to be significantly more effective than treatments involving a Tricoderma viridae with 100% RDP, as well as the control.",International Journal of Plant &amp; Soil Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://journalijpss.com/index.php/IJPSS/article/download/4461/8812', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.9734/ijpss/2024/v36i44461?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.9734/ijpss/2024/v36i44461, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Using the interviews and focus group discussions, this study aims at finding out the students’ experience, perception and challenges relating to their English accent. Ten male and twenty female students from the socio culturally and linguistically diverse school in Cotabato City Division volunteered for the study, offering information on the socio cultural, educational, and psychological aspects affecting their ESL learning during the academic year 2022-2023. The study shows that low students’ interactions in English beyond the classroom, the preferred use of students’ native language patterns, and inadequate amounts of exposure to English contexts are specific socio-cultural factors. Learning difficulties include; the imbalance in teachers’ competency, instruction, and teaching methods, and student supplies. On the psychological level, students have anxiety, unstable motivation, and problems with self-efficacy, which provides a meaningful addition to learners’ difficulties. Thus, this study recommended the need to tackle these challenges by increasing the training of teachers, developing quality teaching and learning materials, and providing effective learning conditions. These include promotion of English in contextual setting, computer aided instruction, offering counseling and psychological services to boost the learners’ morale.

d75b579e2eabaee0e99d96f392fb213dbef08d71,Land Cover Change using GIS and RS Techniques of the Padma River Floodplain in the Three Adjacent Districts in Bangladesh,"Bangladesh is a nation characterized by its reliance on river systems for various aspects of its socio-economic and geographical features. The region experiences a significant number of natural disasters every year as a result of the existence of the river. The region undergoes regular riverbank erosion as a result of the continuous changing of river channels. This study aimed to assess the changing of the Padma River and its impact on land use and land cover in the three adjacent districts of Munshiganj, Madaripur, and Shariatpur. Geographic Information System (GIS) along with remote sensing (RS) techniques were employed to analyze data collected between 1988 and 2023. Best results in detecting land-use/land-cover type and identifying erosional impact were achieved using K-means cluster unsupervised image classification. The accuracy of image preprocessing and classification was separately evaluated using the kappa coefficient. For the years 1988, 1993, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013, 2017, and 2023, the findings indicated an overall accuracy of 86.36%, 83.32%, 87.1%, 85.43%, 87.3%, 87.92%, 88.42%, 90.06% and a kappa coefficient of 83.02%, 83.32%, 86.66%,85.37%, 87.78%, 87.29%, 87.91%, 86.59% respectively. Arable land accounted for 56.40 percent of the overall accreted land area (26340.06 ha), whereas cropland accounted for just 5.99 percent (2798.10 ha) based on long-term river channel migration results. In 35 years, arable land (23661.21 ha) suffered the most erosion (55.42%), followed by inland water (3351.53 ha), which suffered the least (7.15%). The implementation of an embankment inside the research area is proposed as a potentially efficacious strategy for mitigating riverbank erosion in this particular region. The government may implement long-term rehabilitation projects to support individuals who have been displaced by bank erosion and are now landless.

03e82bfb1474272082b39a528307946de65e4b6a,Impact of a self-defense and self-assertion course on self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women,"Introduction & Purpose
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines violence as “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation” (World Health Organization, 2002, p. 5). There are different types of violence: physical, somatic or bodily violence, psychological, psychic or emotional violence, sexual violence, and violence involving deprivation or neglect (World Health Organization, 2002).
The number of violent crimes across Austria rose by 16.9% in 2022 compared to the previous year, to 78,836 reports (Bundesministerium für Inneres, 2023). According to Statista (2024), Austria ranked sixth out of a total of 27 European countries in terms of the relative number of people affected by rape in 2021, with women affected 9.2 times more frequently than men (37.8 vs. 4.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively). Austria ranked the same across Europe (out of 28 countries) with regard to the rate of female victims of intentional homicide, with a total of 0.98 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants (Europäisches Institut für Gleichstellungsfragen, 2022).
Robust psychological differences between women and men, so-called gender gaps, have been shown in literature. One gender gap, which has been systematically researched since the 1990s and which can still be found across cultures, is the lower self-esteem and self-confidence of girls and women compared to boys and men (Casale, 2020). This gender gap can in turn lead to inequalities in social status and salary (Righetti et al., 2020).
Psychological characteristics again appear to play an important role in violence. Indeed, Fazzone et al. (2000) identified personal protective factors, which include characteristics such as self-confidence, self-reliance, self-motivation, flexibility, and self-assurance, against community and interpersonal violence in home health care.
Scientific studies have shown the effectiveness of self-defense courses on psychological characteristics such as self-confidence and assertiveness of participants (Brecklin, 2008; Gidycz & Dardis, 2014). In particular, most of the self-defense training programs that were analyzed showed positive changes in the measured psychological characteristics, although these results were not always consistent (Brecklin, 2008). In addition, supposed important characteristics such as self-confidence and self-assurance were not measured in the majority of cases (Brecklin, 2008). It is also worth mentioning that these older studies are mostly unpublished dissertations and, in accordance with Brecklin (2008), measures used should be revised to better fit the specific situational goals of self-defense training. This means that rather than just measuring assertiveness in everyday situations, it would be interesting to measure the likelihood of participants using assertiveness techniques in potential assault situations (Brecklin, 2008).
The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate possible effects of a self-defense and self-assertion course (SSC) on self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women when being put into potential assault situations.
Methods
A quasi-experimental study was conducted with voluntary adult female participants in a two-day SSC lasting a total of 10 hours, along with adult female controls who also took part in the study. Inclusion criteria were female gender, age ≥ 18 years, fluency in German (reading and writing), and written informed consent. Participants who had taken part in a SSC or had been practicing martial arts/ combat sports within the 3 months before or during the surveyed period were excluded from the study. The participants were asked about the effects of the SSC as well as the control period using a standardized online questionnaire that complies with the ethical standards of the Department of Sports Science at the University of Innsbruck (certificate of good standing, 25/2006). The survey was conducted at two different times: directly before the start and directly after the end of the SSC (or before and after the simultaneous control period). The questionnaire in German language, which was developed based on relevant literature (Brecklin, 2008; Kidder et al., 1983), included both quantitative and qualitative variables such as open questions. Among other things, the participants were asked to imagine themselves in situations in which they were exposed to different forms as well as intensities of violence and to indicate their level of self-confidence and self-assurance in these situations. A visual analogue scale ranging continuously from 0 (does not apply at all) to 100 (applies completely) was used for this purpose. The SSC took place in the city of Innsbruck (Austria) at various educational institutions between May 2019 and February 2020. The program of the SSC was standardized and included physical defense techniques such as punching, pushing, and kicking techniques (~15%), protective postures, and liberation techniques (~50%), as well as theoretical inputs, exercises for setting boundaries, case studies, and role plays (~35%). Participants of the control group were free in choosing their activities during the control period, however, the participation neither in a SSC nor in martial arts/ combat sports was allowed.
Data are presented as means ± standard deviations. After checking for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test) and for homogeneity (Levene-Test), t-tests for independent samples were applied to check for differences between means of the change score of the assessed parameters of the two samples. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 29 women took part in the study: 18 in the intervention group (IG, 40.0 ± 12.4 years) and 11 in the control group (CG, 30.5 ± 9.9 years). The age difference between the groups was not significant. The results indicate that women in the IG showed significant changes in several parameters compared to those in the CG, particularly when being put into situations in which they were exposed to different forms and intensities of violence. Accordingly, higher self-confidence and self-assurance were evident in the case of severe physical violence as well as in the case of mild psychological violence and higher self-assurance was shown in the case of severe psychological violence (Figure 1). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to mild physical violence or mild and severe sexual violence. Furthermore, the assessment of the open questions with regard to the organization of the SSC and the program offered suggests that the courses were very well received by the participants.
Discussion
The study shows that a relatively short SSC leads to a higher increase of both self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women, both in situations of physical and psychological violence, compared to the control group. No significant differences between the groups were found with regard to situations of sexual violence, which is presumably due to the framework conditions of the courses (with only female participants). Therefore, future studies evaluating the impact of SSC on self-confidence and self-assurance of women exposed to sexual violence should include practice with male training partners. Additionally, in the interest of sustainability, it is important to achieve long-term changes in attitudes and behavior, which should be the goal of future research.
The study’s limitations that should be considered include the lack of an a priori power analysis, the absence of random group allocation, the missing standardization and supervision of the activity of the control group, the use of non-validated single-item scales, possible bias due to the overestimation of effects because of the temporal proximity of the survey to the SSC, and the failure to account for confounding variables such as age, which however did not differ significantly between groups.
Conclusion
Since violence is often perpetrated against women, particularly in Austria, and since women show less self-confidence and self-assurance than men, the promotion of high-quality SSC lasting at least 10 hours can be recommended to women in order to strengthen these resources.

The study population consisted of 203 students studying at Bartın University, Faculty of Sports Sciences, Department of Physical Education and Sports in the 2022-2023 academic year. The sample of the study comprised 165 volunteer students (98 male and 67 female) selected through a simple random sampling method. Data were collected using a personal information form for the candidates, the ""Attitude Toward the Teaching Profession Scale (ATTPS)"" and ""Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)"". The collected data were analyzed using frequency, percentage distribution, and arithmetic mean, as well as independent sample t-test and the pearson correlation analyses. The SPSS 26.0 software package was employed for data analysis. The study results revealed a significant difference in the mean total scores of ATTPS and SWLS based on the t-test results of the active engagement in sports variable (p<0.05). Regarding the family income variable, the correlation analysis indicated a moderate and positive significant relationship with mean SWLS total scores, while no significant relationship was found with mean ATTPS total scores (p<0.05). Similarly, for the leisure time variable, a moderate and positive significant relationship was identified with mean SWLS total scores, but no significant relationship was observed with mean ATTPS total scores (p<0.05). Moreover, a low and positive significant relationship was noted between ATTPS and SWLS (p<0.05). In conclusion, the study suggests that as physical education and sports teacher candidates' attitudes toward the teaching profession increase, their levels of satisfaction with life are likely to rise.

There are four types of viruses (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) belonging to the Flaviviridae family. These mosquitoes breed in areas with standing water, including puddles, water tanks, containers and old tires. Lack of reliable sanitation and regular garbage collection also contribute to the spread of the mosquitoes. Each year, thousands of dengue infections are reported and there are several outbreaks of dengue in several countries including Bangladesh and this imply the global importance of this infection.
Objective: To assess the demographic profile of dengue patient with comorbidities in 100 patients in a tertiary care hospital.
Methods: A prospective study was done at Department of Medicine, Uttara Adhunik Medical College and Hospital, Uttara, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2023 to June 2023. Written consent was taken before including the subject to the study. The study included 100 patients who consented to be a part of the study. The patients were subjected to detailed history and clinical examination. Data were collected from hospital records. All the relevant data regarding history and examination findings of the patients, the laboratory reports were collected. Statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 22, was used for data entry and statistical analysis.
Results: Total 100 dengue patients were enrolled in this study. Mean age of all patient was 34.62±16.22 years (12-75 year) with male predominance (54%). Maximum patients were from urban residence (84%), non-smoker (73%), had active lifestyle (63%) and normal body mass index (69%).

cd8796c2a5ff41737874d63b7ee04c9ea30ad076,Patellar tendon complaints and shear wave velocity patterns in maturing alpine skiers,"Introduction 
Patellar tendinopathy is frequent in adolescent athletes and particularly accentuated in competitive alpine skiers (Fröhlich et al., 2020). Tendinopathies are characterized by long disease histories, and whether they can be healed completely is an open question (Kettunen et al., 2002). Three-dimensional (3D) shear wave elastography (SWE) has proven valuable in the early detection of tendinopathies (Götschi et al., 2023). The aims of this study were to (1) describe the longitudinal progression of patellar tendon complaint prevalence in competitive alpine skiers during adolescence, (2) compare the SWV patterns of skiers that were symptomatic four years ago with those with no history of patellar tendon complaints and (3) analyse whether shear wave velocity (SWV) average values correlate with SWV coefficient of variation (CV). 
Methods 
Forty-seven subjects were analysed in this 4-year follow-up study regarding their patellar tendon complaints and SWV patterns. Symptomatic and asymptomatic skiers were identified by clinical examinations including the criteria of pain sensation under loading and palpation-induced pain. SWV was determined by ultrasound-based 3D SWE. Prevalence differences were assessed using Pearson’s χ2 tests. Group differences in the SWV patterns were analysed using unpaired sample t tests. Correlations between SWV average and CV values were analysed by means of Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 
Results 
With proceeding adolescence, the prevalence of patellar tendon complaints significantly decreased from 29.8% at baseline assessment (13-16 years) to 12.7% at follow-up assessment (Pearson’s χ2 = 9.429; p = 0.002). Those skiers who were symptomatic at baseline but asymptomatic at the follow-up still had lower average SWV values and higher CVs than asymptomatic skiers with no history of patellar tendon complaints (p = 0.054 and p = 0.011, respectively). Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between the tendon SWV average values and their CVs (R = -0.55; p < 0.001). 
Discussion/Conclusion 
Despite the decreasing prevalence of patellar tendon complaints in youth competitive alpine skiers after their growth spurt, structural abnormalities appear to remain in asymptomatic subjects with a previous history of patellar tendinopathy, indicating potential long-term implications for mechanical tendon proprieties. The SWV average and CV values were negatively correlated, which underlines our hypothesis that a low SWV is associated with a high CV. This altogether may reflect the degenerative processes in patellar tendons affected by complaints in the early stages of a sports career.

Employing a descriptive causal-comparative research design, the study aims to delineate the characteristics of respondents, their major focus areas, and their readiness for the LEPT, exploring whether these characteristics contribute to observed differences in readiness. The study focuses on fifty purposively identified BSED graduating students at Notre Dame of Midsayap College during the second semester of the Academic Year 2022-2023, with a predominant representation of females and a majority majoring in mathematics. Findings underscore the overall readiness of respondents for the LEPT, particularly in terms of review materials encompassing general and professional education, as well as fields of specialization. Noteworthy variations were observed, with ample review materials available for certain subjects, such as “Understanding the Self” and “Readings in Philippine History,” contrasting with limited materials for others, including “Ethics” and “Arts Appreciation.” Analysis also reveals disparities in the availability of review materials for specific components like “Field Study and Teaching Internship” and “Action Research,” with varying degrees of coverage on concepts and emerging issues in their respective fields of specialization. In assessing knowledge levels, respondents demonstrated a commendable understanding of key subjects such as “The Life and Works of Rizal” and “Readings in Philippine History,” along with a robust grasp of “Field Study and Teaching Internship” concepts and practices within their chosen specializations. Concerning study habits, respondents exhibited readiness, coupled with a consistent inclination to seek Divine guidance, yet with room for improvement in allocating study time across subjects. Attitude-wise, the majority expressed a strong determination to succeed in the exam, albeit with varied responses regarding remaining calm in challenging situations. Statistical analysis revealed that females exhibited higher readiness levels for the LEPT compared to males, constituting a significant difference. While science majors demonstrated greater readiness, the disparity was not statistically significant compared to other majors.",International journal of research and innovation in social science,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47772/ijriss.2024.802038?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2024.802038, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Using the interviews and focus group discussions, this study aims at finding out the students’ experience, perception and challenges relating to their English accent. Ten male and twenty female students from the socio culturally and linguistically diverse school in Cotabato City Division volunteered for the study, offering information on the socio cultural, educational, and psychological aspects affecting their ESL learning during the academic year 2022-2023. The study shows that low students’ interactions in English beyond the classroom, the preferred use of students’ native language patterns, and inadequate amounts of exposure to English contexts are specific socio-cultural factors. Learning difficulties include; the imbalance in teachers’ competency, instruction, and teaching methods, and student supplies. On the psychological level, students have anxiety, unstable motivation, and problems with self-efficacy, which provides a meaningful addition to learners’ difficulties. Thus, this study recommended the need to tackle these challenges by increasing the training of teachers, developing quality teaching and learning materials, and providing effective learning conditions. These include promotion of English in contextual setting, computer aided instruction, offering counseling and psychological services to boost the learners’ morale. The findings of this study are hoped to help educators, and relevant stakeholders understand the best practices on how to help ESL learner Senior High School Students to break barriers and succeed academically and in their future careers as the world becomes a global village.",Randwick International of Education and Linguistics Science Journal,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.randwickresearch.com/index.php/rielsj/article/download/1031/1314', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47175/rielsj.v5i3.1031?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47175/rielsj.v5i3.1031, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 I would like to wish you all the best for the new year! It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to our first regular issue in 2024, which is already the 30th year that J.UCS has been available to authors and readers without any interruptions. I would like to gratefully acknowledge the visionary ideas of Prof. Hermann Maurer, who founded the journal and ran it successfully for many years, preparing the ground for it to become one of the longest-running open content journals in computer science. 
 Looking back on the past year, we have further increased our visibility and taken steps to fully comply with the Diamond Open Content Standard and prepare to join the KOALA initiative. Thanks to the combined efforts of the Pensoft team and the J.UCS publishing team, we are listed and indexed in more than 40 indexing services worldwide, including DOAJ, Web of Science, and Scopus. The increased visibility and social media presence have also led to a further increase in page views and article downloads. With around 100,000 unique views, interest has doubled compared to the previous year. We can also look back on an increasing number of submitted articles and special issue proposals. We are also very pleased to report that the journal's Impact Factor has stabilised at a high level with a Web of Science Impact Factor of 1.0 and a Scopus Science Score of 2.7. We proudly look back on a total of 12 issues - 11 regular and 1 special issue - with 63 articles by 231 authors from 40 countries on new aspects of various computer science topics. The acceptance rate has fallen to below 15 per cent. 
 These great achievements were only possible thanks to the commitment and interest of the community and the valuable support of the Editorial Board and the J.UCS Consortium members.

0ca01e3cd55eaa35d6b9d8f1fa54820fd1f8c594,Implementation and Effectiveness of National Learning Camp (NLC): Their Influence on Learners’ Performance,"This descriptive-correlational study explored the implementation and effectiveness of the National Learning Camp (NLC) and their influence on learners' performance in the Schools Division of Iloilo, Philippines, for the academic year 2023–2024. The study involved 347 randomly selected secondary teachers specializing in English, Mathematics, and Science who volunteered in the NLC. Respondents were classified by educational attainment, position, specialization, school size, and congressional district. The independent variables were the implementation and effectiveness of the NLC, while the dependent variable was learners' performance, measured through achievement test scores in the identified subjects. The research utilized a survey instrument adapted from the Department of Education's Monitoring and Evaluation Tool specified in DepEd Order No. 14, series 2023. Statistical analyses included frequency, mean, t-test, analysis of variance, and multiple regression, with a significance level set at 0.05. Findings revealed that the NLC was largely implemented and had a high level of effectiveness. Significant differences were noted in the implementation and effectiveness of the NLC based on teacher specialization and school size. However, no significant differences in learners' performance were found when classified by the same variables.

335d05c2756dbd3507424421469be18d7e7f5366,Assessment of Soil Respiration in Response to Decomposition of Different Crop Residues,"C: Nratio of crop residues is the key factor dictating the decomposition of crop residues and soil respiration. Crop residue incorporation is one of the best residue management options, which not only enhances soil health, but also reduces environmental pollution. 
Aim: To investigate the effects of various crop residues viz., paddy, sunflower, cotton and red gram on soil respiration. 
Study Design: Completely Randomized Design. 
Place and duration of study: Study was conducted for 120 days at soil science laboratory during the year 2023-24, School of Agriculture, SR university, Warangal. 
Methodology: An incubation study was conducted after pre-incubation. Soil respiration was measured by alkali trap method, at different days after incubation. 
Results: The results indicated that incorporating crop residues significantly increased soil respiration rates, with the highest CO₂ emissions observed in treatments with both residues and nitrogen. Among the treatments, soil with paddy residue and nitrogen showed the highest respiration rate, demonstrating the synergistic effect of residue incorporation and nitrogen addition in enhancing organic matter decomposition. The lowest soil respiration was recorded in soil alone (control) treatment throughout the incubation period. 
Conclusion: The study concludes that the incorporation of crop residues, especially when combined with nitrogen, significantly enhances soil respiration. The research provides critical insights for developing strategies that promote sustainable agriculture, emphasizing the need for residue retention and appropriate nutrient management to maximize soil productivity while minimizing environmental impacts.",Asian Journal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.9734/ajsspn/2025/v11i1479', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.9734/ajsspn/2025/v11i1479?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.9734/ajsspn/2025/v11i1479, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 Cultural heritage encompasses the accumulation of both tangible and intangible assets left behind by a nation in the past and it is increasingly drawing the attention of researchers from various disciplines. The realm of cultural heritage tourism has witnessed transformative opportunities in travel modes due to disruptive innovations in interaction design. However, there is a paucity of comprehensive reviews on relevant studies. Therefore, there is a need for research that presents a thorough exploration of interaction design in cultural heritage tourism and outlines future research prospects. To address this gap, the current study utilizes CiteSpace software to conduct visual and quantitative analyses on 168 papers retrieved from the SCIE, SSCI, and AHCI indices on the Web of Science platform from the first publication in 2001 to the year 2023.

9447be6ea37d182d4cfd00ee7090e9cd95b1457d,225 Evaluation of the characteristics and impact of the NCATS CTSA Program pilot translational and clinical studies,"Objectives/Goals: To fully understand the scientific objectives, overall financial commitment, and outcome of the pilot projects. Methods/Study Population: We evaluated pilots reported in the in the annual, interim, and final Research Performance Progress Reports (RPPRs) for Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program UM1 and UL1 grants from FYs 2021–2023 to assess research categories across the translational science spectrum. We analyzed the number of pilots involving human subjects, vertebrate animals, both, or neither; financial allocations; publication outputs; and other characteristics. Pilots reported across multiple years were deduplicated and assigned to the latest reporting year. Each pilot was classified into broad (Category 1) and specific (Category 2) areas. Descriptive statistics, including means and frequency distributions, were generated. Multi-year pilots with NA or 0 values used the most recent prior value. Results/Anticipated Results: In the period from FY 2021 to 2023, 61 hubs reported 1,811 unique pilot projects in their RPPRs, receiving a total of approximately $62 million, of which two-thirds were expended. On average, each hub conducted 30 pilots with an award size of about $35K. Just over half of the pilots involved human subjects research (HSR), while about one-third were neither HSR nor vertebrate animal studies (VAS), with the remaining focused primarily on VAS. Notably, only 13% of pilots resulted in peer-reviewed publications. Collaborative efforts were observed in one-third of the projects. The majority of pilots fell into Preclinical Research (46%), followed by Clinical Research (33%) and Public Health (20%). Limitations in data quality were identified, and ten pilots reported $0 awarded funds, which may be captured in future RPPRs. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Analysis of pilots reported in RPPRs from FYs 2021–2023 across 61 hubs shows a strong focus on HSR, highlighting collaborative efforts that enhance translational science and align with CTSA goals.

45d34fe3ab2d4e6c2db1d9b908e3f3fe9d9913d8,164 An algebra assessment and primer for future clinical and translational scientists entering training,"Objectives/Goals: Trainees in clinical and translational science (CTS) take courses in biostatistics, epidemiology, and other quantitative areas. To be most successful, trainees require competency in algebra. We developed a quantitative assessment and study guide to assess trainee’s quantitative skills and provide review material to address weaknesses. Methods/Study Population: The Tufts CTS Graduate Program is the training core of the Tufts CTSI and its associated pre- and post-doctoral T32 awards. Approximately 10 trainees with a range of backgrounds (e.g., physicians, medical students, master’s-level researchers, and basic science PhDs) and varying math education experiences matriculate each year. We wanted to address the resulting range of quantitative skills to help students succeed in our program. In Spring 2023, we met with faculty teaching quantitative courses to identify core algebra concepts needed to succeed in their classes. A graduate student in computational mathematics with extensive tutoring experience then drafted assessment questions, a comprehensive study guide, and brief cheat sheet. The material was reviewed and revised with input from quantitative faculty. Results/Anticipated Results: We developed a 20-item quantitative assessment covering properties of operators; identity elements and inverses; simplification of arithmetic and algebraic expressions; solving algebraic equations; functions; equations of a line; and exponents/logarithms. A cheat sheet provided trainees with a brief refresher for these topics. A study guide provided more detailed instruction, example exercises and solutions, and referenced publicly available, online resources (e.g., Khan Academy). During the introductory summer course for the Tufts CTS Program, trainees were allowed to use the cheat sheet and were given 1 hour to complete the assessment. Trainees who got questions incorrect were directed to relevant sections in the study guide. We anticipate collecting formal feedback to evaluate the material. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Trainees must have adequate foundational algebra skills to succeed in CTS graduate programs and as future researchers.

The money saved has been channeled into an Open Science Fund which supports open research infrastructures, training and support programmes for open research, and diamond open access publishing. With additional financing from regional research institutes and the national ministry, its annual budget currently amounts to approximately 500,000 Euros. A broad representative committee has been set up to decide on the use of the fund. The support for diamond open access journals – whose editors are affiliated with Université de Lorraine or whose scope is especially important for the Lorraine region – typically entails support in the range of 2000 Euros per year. With this money, editors of small and medium-sized scholar-led journals can hire copy-editing assistance, arrange editorial board meetings and workshop, et cetera. As Vice-President for Open Science at the University, Nicolas Fressengeas stresses the importance of involving the right stakeholders within and around the university to make the best possible use of the Open Science Fund. He is also concerned with research assessment reforms aiming to assure that the extra work required to follow open research practices is properly rewarded. As Head of Research Support at the University Library, Jean-François Lutz argues that the consequences for researchers and students as a result of the cancellation of the Springer and Wiley deals were less acutely felt than one might have expected. The responsibility of supporting open science may be a new challenge to most librarians, but it does make the library relevant and useful for a broad group of researchers, many of whom would not have been in contact with the library if it wasn’t for the Open Science Fund and the services and projects associated with it.

ef775a3ede518ae248b01042b46d9ca21ff515f3,Demystifying the New Dilemma of Brain Rot in the Digital Era: A Review,"Background/Objectives: The widespread phenomenon of “brain rot”, named the Oxford Word of the Year 2024, refers to the cognitive decline and mental exhaustion experienced by individuals, particularly adolescents and young adults, due to excessive exposure to low-quality online materials, especially on social media. The present study is exploratory and interpretative in nature, aiming to investigate the phenomenon of “brain rot”, with a focus on its key pillars, psychological factors, digital behaviors, and the cognitive impact resulting from the overconsumption of low-quality digital content. Methods: This study employs a rapid review approach, examining research published between 2023 and 2024 across PubMed, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. It explores the causes and effects of brain rot, focusing on the overuse of social media, video games, and other digital platforms. Results: The findings reveal that brain rot leads to emotional desensitization, cognitive overload, and a negative self-concept. It is associated with negative behaviors, such as doomscrolling, zombie scrolling, and social media addiction, all linked to psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. These factors impair executive functioning skills, including memory, planning, and decision-making. The pervasive nature of digital media, driven by dopamine-driven feedback loops, exacerbates these effects. Conclusions: The study concludes by offering strategies to prevent brain rot, such as controlling screen time, curating digital content, and engaging in non-digital activities. Given the increasing prevalence of digital engagement, it is essential to explore a variety of strategies, including mindful technology use, to support cognitive health and emotional well-being. The results can guide various stakeholders—policymakers, practitioners, researchers, educators, and parents or caregivers—in addressing the pervasive impact of brain rot and promoting a balanced approach to technology use that fosters cognitive resilience among adolescents and young adults.",Brain Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci15030283', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11939997, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study demonstrates an efficient approach to gaining insights about the rural health research literature by automated bibliometrics analysis. Methods/Study Population: We developed an automated pipeline to retrieve the 1972–2023 PubMed publications indexed with the MeSH terms “Rural Health” and “United States”. The article metadata in XML format were downloaded and parsed, including title, year, journal, author institutions, and MeSH terms. Each institution address was augmented by Google Maps API to obtain the county and latitude/longitude coordinates. Summary statistics were computed for the publication years, journals, author departments, and locations. A topic network was generated from the frequent co-occurring MeSH terms. The institutions were linked to Rural-Urban Continuum Codes and labeled on a map to visualize their geographic distribution. Results/Anticipated Results: A total of 4564 articles on rural health were analyzed. Two salient peaks of publications were revealed, one around 1978 and the other around 1993. The top author departments include Family Medicine, Nursing, Pediatrics, and Epidemiology. The five leading institutions reside in Chapel Hill, Minneapolis, Iowa City, Seattle, and Atlanta. The geographic distribution shows few institutions that reside in deep rural areas are well published on rural health, although the most scholarly productive institutions do seem adjacent to some moderately rural pockets. The frequently identified topics pertain to age group, study design, and specific concepts such as health services accessibility. Discussion/Significance of Impact: The two publication peaks in history were likely linked to certain policy milestone or seminal publication.

e274e86dc9ce8ff8c993735173f6dbac04e49851,Neonatal Risk Assessment: Analysis of Obstetrical and Neonatal Data,"Background Neonatal suffering is a major health problem in Morocco, as in other countries, and concerns the difficulties encountered by the newborn during the perinatal period. According to the WHO, the causes of this suffering are multiple, including health care, maternal health, access to health services, education and nutrition.
Aim This study aims to clarify the epidemiological and anthropometric profile of neonatal suffering in Morocco by analysing 1,416 cases recorded over a five-year period (2019-2023) at the Idrissi Hospital in Kénitra.
Result Analysis of Apgar scores, birth weights and foetal aspects reveals a predominance of full-term births (81.9%), with foetal weights mainly between 2,600 and 3,600 grams (50.8%). However, a significant proportion of newborns required resuscitation at birth (85.2%), indicating a high prevalence of perinatal complications. The low Apgar scores at 1 minute, with 58.6% of newborns having a score of less than 6, underline the importance of intensive neonatal monitoring. In addition, the distribution of medical interventions shows that 67.4% of deliveries required interventions such as episiotomy or caesarean section, reflecting proactive management of obstetric risks. In addition, the logistic regression model identified key factors associated with the need for neonatal resuscitation, such as maternal age, number of live babies, 1-minute Apgar score and newborn weight.
Conclusion These results underline the importance of rigorous antenatal surveillance, particularly for pregnancies identified as being at risk, in order to prevent neonatal suffering.

d3cdb5a13defab79b97cac0dbbb6822f69e9b11f,Casos de Bullying entre Estudiantes de la Facultad de Humanidades y Ciencias de la Educación Pilar,"This descriptive, non-experimental study addresses the phenomenon of bullying at the Faculty of Humanities and Education Sciences in Pilar during the year 2023, aiming to describe its characteristics, manifestations, and contexts of occurrence. Through surveys and interviews with students, professors, and administrative staff, different forms of bullying, such as cyberbullying, verbal aggression, and social exclusion, were identified. The results reveal that a large portion of students have either been victims or witnesses of bullying, with a significant prevalence of online aggression. Additionally, the study shows that both the physical and virtual environments of the faculty serve as spaces where these behaviors manifest, suggesting the need for more effective preventive policies. Although most respondents did not report a significant impact on their emotional or academic well-being, an important percentage indicated they were negatively affected. These findings highlight the importance of implementing comprehensive preventive measures and support for victims, as well as improving the perception of institutional actions against bullying. The study concludes that bullying in the university context is an issue that requires greater attention and strong institutional strategies to ensure a safer and more equitable academic environment",Pedagogical Constellations,2024.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.69821/constellations.vi.43?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.69821/constellations.vi.43, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There is a great discussion about ChatGPT and its knowledge in medical sciences, however, literature is lacking to evaluate the ChatGPT knowledge level in public health. Therefore, this study investigates the knowledge of ChatGPT in public health, infectious diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its vaccines. Methods Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) bank was established. The question’s contents were reviewed and confirmed that the questions were appropriate to the contents. The MCQs were based on the case scenario, with four sub-stems, with a single correct answer. From the MCQs bank, 60 MCQs we selected, 30 MCQs were from public health, and infectious diseases topics, 17 MCQs were from the COVID-19 pandemic, and 13 MCQs were on COVID-19 vaccines. Each MCQ was manually entered, and tasks were given to determine the knowledge level of ChatGPT on MCQs. Results Out of a total of 60 MCQs in public health, infectious diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic, and vaccines, ChatGPT attempted all the MCQs and obtained 17/30 (56.66%) marks in public health, infectious diseases, 15/17 (88.23%) in COVID-19, and 12/13 (92.30%) marks in COVID-19 vaccines MCQs, with an overall score of 44/60 (73.33%). The observed results of the correct answers in each section were significantly higher (p = 0.001). The ChatGPT obtained satisfactory grades in all three domains of public health, infectious diseases, and COVID-19 pandemic-allied examination.

A Bibliometric and Content Analysis Discourse","More frequently and in more ways than one might think, oil spills are a very common phenomenon. There were three major (>700 tonnes; Asia and Africa) and four minor oil spills only in 2022 (between 7 and 700 tonnes; North America, Asia, and Africa). Oil spills have been known to cause numerous negative ecological, societal, economic, and public health impacts. Not only this but oil spills require rapid response to contain and mitigate multidimensional damages caused. A SCOPUS search of the keyword ‘Oil Spills’ in ‘’Article title, Abstracts, and Keywords’ and ‘Article title’ results in 30529 and 9851 (as of March 4th, 2023) documents (Journal articles, Conference proceedings, Books, Book series, Trade journals, and Reports). In the year 2023 alone, the SCOPUS database had 297 documents at the time of writing. Such a massive database requires a retrospection of underlying and emerging themes for readers to understand the extant literature and to uncover future research agendas. This study is an attempt to conduct a bibliometric analysis of select ‘Oil spill’ publications.

The ""Merdeka Belajar"" curriculum was developed to be more flexible, focusing on essential content, character development, and competencies. Within the Pancasila Student Profile Strengthening Project (P5) in the ""Merdeka Belajar"" Curriculum, there is a project-based extracurricular activity designed to reinforce efforts in achieving competencies and character traits according to the Pancasila student profile, formulated based on graduation competency standards. With the introduction of this new program, a review is needed regarding the implementation results of P5 from the perspective of specific subjects, namely natural sciences. For example, the implementation of P5 at MTs Negeri 2 Jember is still considered unfamiliar and has recently been enforced. Through observation, event monitoring, and interviews with relevant parties, the expected results are anticipated to be beneficial for subsequent learning. All stages have been executed successfully, leading to the conclusion that this community service activity has effectively enhanced the competence of teachers in carrying out the Pancasila student profile strengthening project. The project encompasses understanding, design, documentation, reporting, as well as evaluation and follow-up actions with satisfactory outcomes.  AbstrakPada tahun ajaran 2022/2023 pemerintah Indonesia mengesahkan dan mulai memberlakukan kurikulum baru hasil pengembangan dari penyempurnaan dari kurikulum sebelumnya yakni kurikulum merdeka belajar.

Physical activities are important to maintain and promote physical functioning and activities of daily living in people with dementia. Nurses are in a key position to deliver physical activity interventions in nursing homes. However, synthesized strategies for sustainable implementation of physical activity interventions in nursing homes for people with dementia are lacking.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed at synthesizing the evidence on nurse-led physical activity interventions and at identifying facilitators and barriers to sustainable implementation of physical activity interventions for people with dementia.


DESIGN
Systematic review.


REVIEW METHODS
We performed a comprehensive literature search combining database searches (MEDLINE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Web of Science Core Collection; last search: September 27, 2023) and supplementary search methods (citation tracking, web searching, clinical guideline database searching). We considered studies on nurse-led physical activity interventions for people with dementia living in nursing homes for eligibility; published as journal articles and related material in English, French, German language, without restrictions on primary study design and publication year. Independently and in duplicate, we assessed the references' eligibility and the quality of the included studies. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to appraise quality of included studies. We piloted and double-checked data extractions, and summarized the results narratively and graphically (harvest plot). We prospectively registered our review (PROSPERO CRD42021271833).


RESULTS
We identified 24 studies (of which eleven were randomized trials) assessing various interventions that we categorized into physical exercise (n = 8), care-integrated physical activity (n = 6), outdoor or walking activity (n = 5), technology-supported physical exercise (n = 3), and dancing (n = 2). Types of outcomes and length of follow-up varied widely. Effects were inconclusive, except for outdoor or walking activities showing an overall positive impact on physical outcomes. For eight interventions, we identified evidence on implementation barriers (b) and facilitators (f), including staff shortage (b), staff time resources (b), or ease of implementation for staff (f) and adaptability of interventions (f) or refusal to participate of people with dementia (b).


CONCLUSIONS
The results of our review provide a comprehensive overview on types, characteristics and effects of nurse-led physical activity interventions for people with dementia in nursing homes. Based on evidence from a range of study designs and sources, we came to the conclusion that all stakeholders involved considered physical activity interventions for people with dementia as useful and relevant. Outcome measures varied widely and a clear conclusion on effectiveness remains open.",International Journal of Nursing Studies,2024.0,4,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/ssrn.4388294?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4388294, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b4deee7036d4970726c84f0aceedd6e45944369f,Linking citation and retraction data reveals the demographics of scientific retractions among highly cited authors,"Retractions are becoming increasingly common but still account for a small minority of published papers. It would be useful to generate databases where the presence of retractions can be linked to impact metrics of each scientist. We have thus incorporated retraction data in an updated Scopus-based database of highly cited scientists (top 2% in each scientific subfield according to a composite citation indicator). Using data from the Retraction Watch database (RWDB), retraction records were linked to Scopus citation data. Of 55,237 items in RWDB as of August 15, 2024, we excluded non-retractions, retractions clearly not due to any author error, retractions where the paper had been republished, and items not linkable to Scopus records. Eventually, 39,468 eligible retractions were linked to Scopus. Among 217,097 top-cited scientists in career-long impact and 223,152 in single recent year (2023) impact, 7,083 (3.3%) and 8,747 (4.0%), respectively, had at least 1 retraction. Scientists with retracted publications had younger publication age, higher self-citation rates, and larger publication volume than those without any retracted publications. Retractions were more common in the life sciences and rare or nonexistent in several other disciplines. In several developing countries, very high proportions of top-cited scientists had retractions (highest in Senegal (66.7%), Ecuador (28.6%), and Pakistan (27.8%) in career-long citation impact lists). Variability in retraction rates across fields and countries suggests differences in research practices, scrutiny, and ease of retraction. Addition of retraction data enhances the granularity of top-cited scientists’ profiles, aiding in responsible research evaluation. However, caution is needed when interpreting retractions, as they do not always signify misconduct; further analysis on a case-by-case basis is essential. The database should hopefully provide a resource for meta-research and deeper insights into scientific practices.",PLoS Biology,2025.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11781634, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b4210b0308d83ff45eab9b4d740c46169c255306,ICT-Based Game: An Alternative to Promote Healthy Eating in Ecuadorian Children Using User-Centred Design,"Inadequate nutrition in Ecuadorian children leads to various physical, cognitive, and biological issues. However, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) has become established in raising awareness and promoting beneficial eating behaviours. This research, conducted at the Indo-America Educational Unit during the 2022-2023 academic year in Ambato, Ecuador, aimed to compare the effectiveness of a guide text versus a didactic game in enhancing knowledge about healthy eating among fifth-grade students in Natural Sciences. The study involved 87 fifth-grade students, divided into two groups: Group 1, consisting of 42 students, and Group 2, consisting of 45 students. The teacher of Group 1 used traditional methods (reading and writing from the text), while the teacher of Group 2 employed a game called Flavour Puzzle. Statistical analysis revealed significant improvements in knowledge and motivation for students using the game-based method. Specifically, students in Group 2 showed a 26% greater improvement in knowledge levels compared to those in Group 1, and their motivation levels were nearly three times higher (89% vs. 30%). The results indicate that the game-based method has a clear comparative advantage over traditional text-based instruction, as it not only facilitated teaching but also enhanced socialization and engagement among students. Technological resources like Flavour Puzzle are more engaging for students and should be utilized as both recreational and educational tools in teaching Natural Sciences at the school level.

1df1a0307e688d9406ac2437ff2ec9f8283ccd60,Preface,"IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering International Nuclear Science, Technology and Engineering Conference 2023 (iNuSTEC2023) “Nuclear Science and Technology For Socio-economic Development “ Universiti Tenaga Nasional Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia 10-12 October 2023 MESSAGE FROM: VICE-CHANCELLOR, UNIVERSITI TENAGA NASIONAL (UNITEN) UNITEN is honored to host the International Nuclear Science, Technology, and Engineering Conference 2023 (iNUSTEC2023) and the Nuclear Youth Competition (NYC). With the theme “Nuclear Science and Technology for Sustainable Development Goals”, iNuSTEC2023 is the thirteenth in a series of conferences hosted by the Malaysian Nuclear Society (MNS) since 2010 through collaboration with research institutes and local universities. Don’t we feel like time has passed by so quickly? And with it, came along significant and some were unthinkable changes to our lives. According to Our World in Data statistics, in 2022, each of us consumed on average 3.5 times more energy compared to 40 years ago. In the year 2050, Malaysia is expected to consume almost twice the amount of electricity in 2022 (320 TWh vs. 180 TWh). This means that on a daily basis in 2050, Malaysia is expected to consume close to 0.9 TWh of electricity per day. About 50 million electric vehicles are expected to be on the road in 2050. Every day, about 0.6 TWh of electricity is needed to charge these cars. That is an additional two-thirds of the expected daily electricity consumption per person in 2050. Malaysia has identified the pathways for Responsible Transition 2050 in the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) to tackle the energy trilemma of affordability, security, and sustainability. These pathways include having 0% coal share and 70% renewable energy share of installed capacity in 2050. 70% of renewable energy share is about 57 GW of solar PV, which will take a total land size that is slightly smaller than Melaka state. The same amount of power can be generated by nuclear power on a total land size that is 10 times smaller. That is not even considering the intermittency of power generation with solar PV. At UNITEN, we believe that research and knowledge in nuclear power can play a huge role in supporting the Low Carbon Nation Aspiration and the Responsible Transition, especially in providing affordable, clean and safe energy supply to the Rakyat. Institute of Nuclear Energy (INE) at UNITEN was established in May this year to further empower and accelerate the existing research and educational efforts done at UNITEN since 2010. At the university level, UNITEN has established the National Energy Centre (NEC) to support the national energy transition efforts. NEC will serve as a hub for research institutes, industrial and international linkages, and government agencies to form collaborations with experts from local and foreign universities, energy agencies, and stakeholders. UNITEN envisions that NEC will play a significant role in providing technological solutions for Malaysia’s energy transition which will be beneficial to Malaysia, as well as the surrounding region. NEC will also play the role of capacity building for the country’s future workforce that will lead Malaysia towards net-zero in 2050. I extend my warmest invitation to every participant attending this conference, to be a part of this concerted nationwide effort in championing sustainability through involvement with the NEC. I would like to remind participants, that you are among the very small percentage of Malaysia’s population, who are experts in the nuclear field. Thank you so much for your contributions to keeping the knowledge related to nuclear science and engineering alive, despite how hard or negative it can get in the industry. Congratulations to the organizing committee for hosting this iNuSTEC2023 together with the Nuclear Youth Competition (NYC2023).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. The study sample size was 145 MD3 year college of medicine students for the academic year 2023–2024. The evaluation instruments included the participants’ exam grades, pre-test scores, post-test scores, and feedback. The study employed a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative research methods to investigate how students perceived and interacted with the bingo game-based activity. The data were analyzed by Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26. The association between exam and post-test scores was examined using the correlation coefficient and a straightforward regression analysis. The P value of less than 0.05 was deemed significant. RESULTS: The study comprised 145 students in total who completed all the tasks. The post-test scores (10.62 ± 1.73) showed a statistically significant improvement (P < 0.01) over the pre-test scores (6.3 ± 1.99). Most students (85–90%) thought that activities centered around bingo games were great tools for learning. Nine out of ten students said the game-based activity was engaging and enjoyable, that it inspired them to engage in group discussions, that it assisted them in identifying and concentrating on important topics, and that it improved their knowledge and helped them get ready for the final exam. Almost all the participants (>90%) suggested adding this exercise to the list of future topics. Overall, exam scores achieved by students for topics covered in the bingo-based activity (92.7 ± 4.96) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than exam scores for topics not covered in the activity (83.75 ± 7.74). CONCLUSION: Bingo game is an effective learning strategy to promote students’ learning in the immunology course. Furthermore, utilizing bingo games as a formative assessment technique can significantly improve students’ learning and help them achieve higher scores on summative assessments.",Journal of Education and Health Promotion,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_2074_23', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11414857, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This cross-sectional study looked at the attitudes, thoughts, and understanding of healthcare students toward AI. Materials and methods During the academic year 2023-2024, medical students enrolled in the College of Medicine and Health Sciences (CMHS) at the Arabian Gulf University (AGU) were included in this study. A questionnaire was developed to evaluate their understanding and opinions regarding the use of AI in medical training. These data were gathered, categorized, and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 29 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US). Categorical variables were shown in the form of frequencies and percentages, whereas continuous variables were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). Chi-square tests were utilized for comparing categorical variables. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The study found that n=41 (27%) of medical students are very familiar with AI applications while n=92 (60.5%) are somewhat familiar. Familiarity increases as students progress in their medical education, with senior clinical phase students more familiar than juniors. There was no significant difference in perceptions of AI application among medical phases. Familiarity with research methodology and studies increases familiarity with AI applications. Most students believe AI will have a positive impact on medical education, but perceptions vary by educational phase. Many students support integrating AI into curricula with 67 (44.1%) of students using AI applications, with a higher percentage in pre-clinical phases, likely due to application in research projects in this phase. Concerns were raised about AI impacting the human touch in medical practice and doctor-patient communication, as well as technical challenges faced by students when applying AI. Conclusion Arab Gulf medical students show positive attitudes toward AI applications in medical education. Tailored educational strategies are needed to optimize AI integration in medical practice and address concerns effectively.",Cureus,2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11632895, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The expansion of the range of materials involved has led to the acquisition of new facts, as well as made it possible to revise some ideas about the general chronology of H. Faizkhanov’s life and rethink his direct contribution to various fields of oriental studies. The article shows that the arrival of H. Faizkhanov in Saint Petersburg, which took place at least in 1853, had already led him to close interaction with the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences and he was involved in the transcription of manuscripts in Arabic, Persian and Turkic languages, consistently engaged in this work for many years. Faizkhanov was engaged by B. A. Dorn to compile the catalogue of Oriental manuscripts of the Imperial Public Library. Besides, it was with Faizkhanov that the first catalogue of Arabic manuscripts of the Asiatic Museum was started, which was only later completed by V. R. Rosen.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a mentorship program on anxiety levels and pre-internship exam scores among senior nursing students. Methods This quasi-experimental research was conducted on 37 nursing students in the sixth semester of the School of Medical Sciences in Saveh in the year 2023. Participants were selected based on initial criteria using a census method and were then randomly assigned to two groups: the control group (19 participants) and the intervention group (17 participants). The mentoring program for the intervention group was implemented one month before the pre-internship exam and consisted of six sessions, each lasting two hours, over two weeks (three sessions per week). Data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire, the Sarason Anxiety Questionnaire, and pre-internship exam scores. SPSS software version 23 was utilized for data analysis. Results The mean anxiety exam scores in the two control and intervention groups did not exhibit a statistically significant difference before the intervention (P = 0.34). However, the mean anxiety exam score of the intervention group students after the intervention (5.89 ± 15.11) was significantly lower than that of the control group students (7.04 ± 21.42) (P = 0.007). Additionally, the results showed that the mean anxiety exam scores of the intervention group students before (5.77 ± 17.53) and after the intervention (5.89 ± 15.11) had a statistically significant difference (P = 0.013). Furthermore, the mean pre-internship exam scores of the intervention group students (1.71 ± 17.72) were significantly higher than those of the control group students (1.15 ± 16.46) (P = 0.014).

The research took place at SMA Muhammadiyah 1 Gresik, East Java, Indonesia, during the 2023/2024 academic year. The homogeneity of the 59 samples was verified through Levene's test, with a significance value of 0.060 based on average pre-test scores, indicating homogeneity as the significance level was >0.05. Subsequently, pre-test and post-test data were collected from 12th-grade students in the social sciences and humanities (IPS/Shosum) program. Descriptive statistics were applied to analyze both groups' pre-test and post-test data, along with the non-parametric Mann Whitney T-Test, resulting in an Asymp. Sig. (2-tailed) value of 0.071, indicating rejection of the alternative hypothesis as it exceeded 0.05. Nevertheless, it is imperative to address various aspects in future research and practice to explore further potential benefits or drawbacks of incorporating Quizlet in the flipped classroom, including aspects like student engagement, motivation, and long-term retention of material. Additionally, subsequent studies could delve into evaluating the effectiveness of combining Quizlet with other instructional methods or technologies within the flipped classroom framework.","Journal of English Teaching, Literature, and Applied Linguistics",2024.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30587/jetlal.v8i1.7091?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30587/jetlal.v8i1.7091, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

38661749a12ea0365e07762078efbb5953ca07c7,Mercury Lander: Planetary Mission Concept Study for the 2023-2032 Decadal Survey,"As an end-member of terrestrial planet formation, Mercury holds unique clues about the original distribution of elements in the earliest stages of solar system development and how planets and exoplanets form and evolve in close proximity to their host stars. This Mercury Lander mission concept enables in situ surface measurements that address several fundamental science questions raised by MESSENGER's pioneering exploration of Mercury. Such measurements are needed to understand Mercury's unique mineralogy and geochemistry; to characterize the proportionally massive core's structure; to measure the planet's active and ancient magnetic fields at the surface; to investigate the processes that alter the surface and produce the exosphere; and to provide ground truth for current and future remote datasets. NASA's Planetary Mission Concept Studies program awarded this study to evaluate the feasibility of accomplishing transformative science through a New-Frontiers-class, landed mission to Mercury in the next decade. The resulting mission concept achieves one full Mercury year (~88 Earth days) of surface operations with an ambitious, high-heritage, landed science payload, corresponding well with the New Frontiers mission framework. The 11-instrument science payload is delivered to a landing site within Mercury's widely distributed low-reflectance material, and addresses science goals and objectives encompassing geochemistry, geophysics, the Mercury space environment, and surface geology. This mission concept is meant to be representative of any scientific landed mission to Mercury; alternate payload implementations and landing locations would be viable and compelling for a future landed Mercury mission.",,2021.0,4,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06795, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f790aa53d276f7e92edd9390d935d711c16ac41d,Unveiling the Apathy: Understanding the Causes of Student Disengagement in Student Governance,"This study delved into the causes of student disengagement in any form of student-based governance of the University of Cebu College of Arts and Sciences Department's Student Body Organization (CAS-SBO) during the academic year 2023-2024. A descriptive phenomenological research design was employed, exploring participants' experiences in student governance, how these experiences influence their lack of total disengagement and the strategies that could revitalize their engagement and active participation in the said area. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews with twelve students selected via linear snowball sampling, focusing on those with prior governance experience who did not participate in recent CAS-SBO activities. Thematic content analysis revealed nine emergent themes: (1) Lack of Connection, Inequality in Representation, and Faculty Intervention as essential experiences in student governance; (2) Student Unfamiliarity, Feeling Unrepresented, and Unmet Expectations as reasons for disengagement; and (3) Inclusive Activities, Addressing Electoral Disparity, and Empowered Leadership as potential strategies to increase engagement. Based on these findings, the study recommends regular CAS-SBO general assemblies, teambuilding exercises, leadership seminars, and the election of representatives for each degree program to foster more vital student involvement and improve representation. The study also suggests future research topics, including electoral system reforms and former CAS-SBO presidents' experiences.",International Journal of Law and Politics Studies,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32996/ijlps.2024.6.5.3?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32996/ijlps.2024.6.5.3, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 There has been a lot of interest in understanding oral health care utilization behavior as it is important for the delivery of effective oral health care. Identifying the barriers to dental services is one of the basic steps to improving the public health.
 
 
 
 We aimed to determine the barriers affecting the utilization of dental services in dental institutes.
 
 
 
 A cross-sectional survey was conducted among the patients attending the outpatient department of dental institute during the year 2023 among the 364 subjects and the data were collected using a specially designed and pretested questionnaire. The data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics with the help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22.0.
 
 
 
 It was seen that the majority of the participants agreed that cost (55%) was identified as the most imperative factor affecting dental services followed by the dentist-patient relationship at a statistically significant level (P = 0.0001).
 
 
 
 The foremost barriers to dental care utilization were cost, fear, and organization. However, the policies should be fair and impartial as policymakers, administrators, and insurance organizations play a key role in the health care system.

Thus, obviously, the background is different for all candidates. In this paper, we aim to explore the knowledge in mathematics that candidates in the general field of study of economics possess, as in the first semester at all specialties in the field of Economic Sciences, students have the course unit Mathematics for Economists or Linear Algebra and Mathematical Analysis. Now students are not selected at the beginning of the semester in terms of their knowledge of mathematics, respectively, those with a real profile have an advantage over those with a humanist profile.

Methodology. Bibliometric analysis of the studies published in the Web of Science (WOS) database between 1991 and 2023 was analyzed with the VOSviewer (Version 1.6.9) package program. Since the title, content, and keyword of the concept of ""financial literacy"" were intended to be scanned in all languages and all publication types, 2,889 works were accessed and analyzed. The limitations of the study are that only the studies in WOS are analyzed. No data from Scopus and PubMed databases has been included. For future studies, research from the Scopus and PubMed databases should be added. 
Results of the research. When the most frequently included keywords in the publications related to the concept of ""financial literacy"" have a relationship between them at least twice in the study, the keywords ""financial literacy"" with 825 repetitions in terms of 1841 total connection strength, ""financial education"" with 111 repetitions in terms of 315 total connection strength, ""financial behavior"" with 65 repetitions in terms of 217 total connection strength and ""financial knowledge"" with 71 repetitions in terms of 213 total connection power are seen. As a result of the analysis performed, it was determined that there were 2265 connection powers and 4069 total connection powers for a total of 36 clusters. When we look at the year-by-year distribution, the most works were published in 2022 with a maximum of 426 works. At least one work was published in 2004, 2003, 1998, 1994 and 1991. Among the published studies, journal article 2,515, proceedings paper 280, early access 135, book chapters 101, review article 68, editorial material 29, correction 6, book 5, book review 3 were determined as works. When we look at the languages in which the published works are published, they are in English with a maximum of 2,814 works. At least two works are in French and Chinese. In order to determine the year-based stratification status of the published studies for country-based citations, it was noted that a country should have at least 1 study published and at least 1 citation obtained. As a result of the analysis, analysis was carried out on 78 observation units that were found to have a relationship between them, and it was determined that there were 14 clusters, 1065 connection power and 9417 total connection power. The countries with the most citations are the USA (11981 citations), the Netherlands (2445 citations) and England (1685 citations). In terms of the number of works, the ranking is the USA (197 publications), China (77 publications), India (73 publications), and Australia (70 publications).

The initial release of near-real-time (NRT) atmospheric and oceanic science products from Japanese Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 (H8/9) geostationary (GEO) satellites over the South China Sea (SCS) was unveiled in 2024. The primary objective behind crafting these NRT H8/9 satellite products is to facilitate weather and marine environment monitoring, enhance maritime security, and aid ocean navigation, among other purposes. As part of this investigation, a novel NRT data processing system was devised to generate a variety of regional H8/9 GEO satellite science products within a resolution of 10 min and a gridded resolution of 0.05° × 0.05° from 3 November 2022 to the present. This algorithm system was built upon the preceding Fengyun (FY) geostationary satellite algorithm test bed (FYGAT), which was the prototype of the FY-4 GEO meteorological satellite science product operational processing system. These regional H8/9 GEO satellite science products encompass a range of crucial data such as cloud mask, fraction, height, phase, optical, and microphysical properties; layered precipitable water; and sea surface temperature. We subjected these products to rigorous evaluations against high-quality analogous satellite products and reanalysis data spanning 1 year in 2023. The validations underscore a strong consistency between the H8/9 GEO satellite atmospheric and oceanic science products over the SCS and the referenced products. Nevertheless, slight discrepancies in these satellite science products were identified, primarily stemming from variations in sensor/dataset characteristics, retrieval algorithms, and geometric conditions. These outcomes demonstrate the suitability of the first edition of NRT atmospheric and oceanic science products of H8/9 satellites over the SCS in supporting the intended quantitative applications. This NRT GEO satellite data record is publicly accessible through the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) provided by the Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) in China. Free access to the dataset is possible via https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25015853 (Liu et al., 2024).

As directed by Congress, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research on Women's Health requested the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies) to conduct an assessment of the state of women's health research at the NIH. The findings of the National Academies committee include: 1) a significant funding inequity, with less than 8% of the total NIH grant budget for fiscal year 2023 allocated to women's health research; 2) a need for improved strategic NIH-wide priority setting, oversight, and adherence to existing policies to support women's health research; 3) a need for a specific institute for research on conditions specific to women's health; and 4) a need for sufficient training and additional funding to grow and retain the women's health research workforce. The National Academies committee recommends restructuring women's health research at the NIH by creating a new Women's Health Research Institute and cross-disciplinary Women's Health Research Fund, including greater accountability and an infusion of new funds to support both research and career development in women's health. The combination of the new institute, greater prioritization and accountability, and new funding would lead to more rapid innovations and advancements, with the ultimate goal of improving women's health and well-being, which, in turn, improves the well-being of families and communities and bolsters a vibrant, healthier society.",Obstetrics and Gynecology,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1097/AOG.0000000000005841?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000005841, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study evaluated the hand hygiene practices of staff users of the intensive care unit before and after patients’ care.
Methods: A prospective analytical observational study was conducted in the first quarter of the year 2023, among health workers using mixed methods approach. Data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0.
Results: Out of the 154 respondents who filled questionnaire, there were 72 (46.8%) males, 82 (53.2%) females and a mean age of 34.22±7.39 years. One hundred and thirty (84.4%) respondents were aware of the WHO five moments of hand hygiene. Ninety-six (62.3%) respondents opined that they practiced hand hygiene.  However, observation revealed that 510 (98.5%) out of the 518 covertly observed participants did not carry out hand hygiene before patient care and 209 (40.3%) performed hand hygiene after patient care. The dominant reasons for non-compliance were lack of running water (n=126, 81.8%), absence of awareness posters (n=100, 64.9%) and absence of soap for hand washing (n=26, 16.9%). A statistically significant relationship was observed between the frequency of practice of hand hygiene and the category of staff.
Conclusions: Less than expected hand hygiene practice was observed among members of staff, revealing need for emphasis and retraining of staff.

At the Sragen Regency Archives and Library Service, book procurement is often based on intuition or unstructured requests, resulting in many books that are less popular among visitors. This leads to a low number of book borrowings, meaning the library cannot provide optimal services. Based on this issue, the author attempts to cluster the book borrowing data for the year 2023 from the Sragen Regency Archives and Library Service by age group, book categories, number of borrowings, number of titles, and number of copies using data mining techniques with the k-means clustering algorithm. For the initial data processing, the author uses the Min-Max normalization method. After normalization, k-means is calculated with 3 clusters, followed by finding the optimal cluster using the elbow method, silhouette, and gap statistics. The results of the optimal cluster are compared with the results from the Dunn Index method. The research identifies three clusters: Cluster 1 contains book groups with low interest, consisting of 7 categories: General Works, Social Sciences, Language, Pure Sciences, Applied Sciences, Arts and Sports, History and Geography; Cluster 2 contains book groups with moderate interest, consisting of 2 categories: Philosophy and Psychology, Religion; and Cluster 3 contains the book group with the highest interest, consisting of 1 category: Literature",Infotek : Jurnal Informatika dan Teknologi,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.29408/jit.v8i1.28134?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.29408/jit.v8i1.28134, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Stress is an ordinary human reaction that encourages us to face challenges and dangers in life. According to the WHO, four out of every five college students are contemplating or have attempted suicide. Medical education is considered as demanding because students undergo several psychological transformations. It is estimated that half of all significant adult psychiatric illnesses, including depression, begin before the age of fourteen. 75 % of college students do not seek help for mental health issues. (1)  Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three months period of time from the month September till November 2023, among 150 students of various years at Jalalabad State Medical University using online Google forms. The study was conducted using DASS 21-item questionnaire to assess the level of stress, anxiety, and depression among students. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0 software. Ethical approval was taken from the University.  Result: In the study 9% of people reported having a moderate to extremely severe degree of stress, anxiety 27.3% and depression was found among 4% respectively in students. Stress and study of year were substantially correlated. (p = 0.007). Anxiety and extracurricular activities were found to be significiant (p = 0.004). Extracurricular activities and depression were linked. (p = 0.029) and the type of family they belong to (p = 0.015). While stress and depression were shown to be uncommon among medical students, anxiety was found to be more common, which might be related to a variety of factors such as new environments, difficult subjects, complex terminology, etc.  Conclusion: It is important to highlight the points like financial issues, home sick, behaviour of teachers and friends etc would be the stressful elements that might lead to increase the psychological problem among medical student. Following research endeavors in this domain ought to endeavor to address these constraints. In any event, we believe that our results emphasize the necessity of putting policies in place to protect and, where appropriate, improve the mental health and general wellbeing of medical students.",International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24mar1858', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24mar1858?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24mar1858, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The clinical research professional career pathway is particularly underrecognized among undergraduates, despite offering multiple career opportunities. Methods/Study Population: To address these challenges, two undergraduate outreach programs were developed. First, an undergraduate certificate program in CTS (UC-CTS) was designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to enter the workforce immediately after graduation. Second, a “CTS Roadshow” was launched to build awareness of CTS careers within a variety of undergraduate programs and majors. In this recruitment initiative, principal investigators (PIs) and CRPs visit classrooms to share information about CTS career pathways and offer insights into the roles, responsibilities, and professional opportunities available in the field. Results/Anticipated Results: The UC-CTS program launched in Fall 2024 as a 12-credit certificate that includes two paid internships: one in patient care and one in research. Currently, the program has 5 students enrolled with an anticipated increase in enrollment to 20 students by Spring 2025. Similarly, the CTS Roadshow has reached an increasing number of students each year. Since its inception in Spring 2023, the CTS Roadshow has introduced over 750 undergraduates across 21 courses to CTS careers. The CTS Roadshow has engaged students from a variety of majors, including biology, psychology, medical sciences, legal, finance, accounting, and pre-health programs, increasing awareness of and interest in CTS careers. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Both programs aim to expose students to CTS careers early in their education, better preparing them for full-time CTS roles after graduation. A rise in qualified applicants pursuing CTS careers locally and regionally is expected, improving job satisfaction and retention through enhanced preparation for the career field.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.843', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/cts.2024.843?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.843, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

42c3ed6e1c0b3a73e89df513c2f4a39fab0f45fb,The role of sport in research and development in Switzerland - An overview,"Introduction 
In Switzerland, around CHF 24.6 billion will be spent on research, development and innovation in 2021. Much of this will be financed by the private sector. The federal government and the cantons will contribute 21.5% in 2021 and finance research at universities with CHF 5.6 billion (see Körsgen et al., 2023). Sport is negligible in these statistics. This is at odds with the pressure to innovate in competitive sport and the economic and social importance of sport. Is there really almost no research in and on sport in Switzerland, a centre of research and innovation ? 
Methods 
This question was investigated using a mixed research method according to Creswell and Clark (2011). In a first step, the data from the 2019 Swiss Performance Sport Study (Kempf et. all 2021) were updated using desk research. In a second step, targeted searches were conducted in various databases (SNSF and ARAMIS) with a semantic keyword-based search for sport. In addition, a patent search was conducted in the database of the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property using terms related to sport. The results obtained were discussed with experts. 
Results 
Research and development in and with sport plays a minor role in Switzerland. Sport is barely visible institutionally at universities, universities of applied sciences or teacher training colleges. Sport hardly benefits from federal funding. With acquired funds of CHF 5 million from the SNSF funding pools and CHF 2 million from Innosuisse, sport benefits only marginally. Research and development seem to play a subordinate role in the private sector; only patents indicate that research and development play a certain level of activity. 
For sport, the possibilities remain in departmental research. With the EHSM, the Confederation has its own research institution. The Confederation also distributes means for sport specific purposes. CHF 2 million are available each year. The associations receive the lion's share of these funds (CHF 1.5 million). The ""Sport Innovations Hub"" of Swiss Olympic now has CHF 1 million at its disposal for association projects. This fund is financed by lottery money. 
Discussion/Conclusion 
Research, development and innovation are important success factors for sport. As sports federations play an important rule, it is necessary firstly to strengthen the sports federations as important supporters of research and development themes. 
Secondly, the Swiss Federal Institute of Sports (SFISM) should be developed as a leading institution in the field of sports science in order to support networking among federations and to strengthen them in their preparation for the submission of projects to funding bodies in terms of content and cooperation with partners from research institutions and industry.

5be5c8744e855c6125f616370a5f925c4dba7a15,Rapid Surge of Chikungunya in Pakistan Demands Urgent Action,"Chikungunya virus infection is a vector-borne disease that has emerged as a serious public health concern around the world over the past two decades. The disease is associated with a significant morbidity rate with an increased risk of lifelong impairment along with psychological and economic consequences.  Although severe complications are uncommon, chikungunya virus disease (CHIKVD) causes debilitating and persistent joint pain, neurological symptoms, inflammation in the heart muscle, liver damage as well as multiple organ failure in severe cases, which can be life threatening mostly in infants and elderly population.1  The first Chikungunya vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023 is currently licensed in the United States, however, there is no vaccine available in the endemic countries.2 
CHIKV was first identified in Pakistan in 1983 to be circulating in rodents with a limited number of human infections. Since 2015, outbreaks of CHIKV in human population have become more frequent primarily during dengue epidemics.3 The local transmission was confirmed by February 28, 2016 and according to National Institute of Health, Pakistan, a total of 8,521 laboratory confirmed cases were reported from December 2016 till March 2018, with Sindh and Balochistan accounting for the majority of reported cases.4 According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, as of November 30 2024, around 480,000 cases of CHIKVD have been reported worldwide, with over 200 deaths in 2024. Pakistan is among the 23 countries reporting the CHIKVD with approximately 5,726 cases confirmed during the latest outbreak in 2024.5 
Pakistan being a subtropical country, is becoming more vulnerable to the transmission of chikungunya and other vector-borne diseases including dengue, malaria and leishmaniasis due to changes in the climate patterns such as longer summers, shorter milder winters, and an increased frequency of unpredictable and severe weather events. The CHIKVD appears to have overlapping symptoms (fever and severe joint pains) with other viral illnesses such as dengue, which often leads to misdiagnosis resulting in the mistreatment of both illnesses causing serious challenges for healthcare professionals. In addition, an underestimated disease burden is reported. The mosquito vectors responsible for Chikungunya virus transmission are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, species prevalent in Pakistan during and after the monsoon season and the same species also transmit dengue and Zika viruses.6 All of these factors including the upcoming monsoons are likely to contribute to the endemicity of the CHIKVD in Pakistan over the coming year. 
In Pakistan, the overall impact of the CHIKVD is multifaceted with ambiguous consequences due to an underestimated disease burden. The increasing prevalence associated with Chikungunya alongside other vector-borne infections underscores an urgent need for further scientific exploration and public health interventions to alleviate the effects of this emerging infectious 
disease. The impact of Chikungunya on human health can be overwhelming, particularly in countries like Pakistan already burdened by dengue and malaria outbreaks. This emphasizes an immediate and rigorous strategy, including public health campaigns, to be prepared and implemented by the coordinated actions of various health departments including the Ministry of National Health Services Regulations and Coordination (NHSR&C), National Institute of Health (NIH) Pakistan, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and other related divisions.

028e22eb3b7a99bdd1d78188167bad6b32ba94bc,Radical by Nature: The Revolutionary Life of Alfred Russel Wallace,"RADICAL BY NATURE: The Revolutionary Life of Alfred Russel Wallace by James T. Costa. Princeton University Press, 2023. 552 pages. Hardcover; $39.95. ISBN: 9780691233796. *Most people, when asked, ""Who is Charles Darwin?,"" would quickly respond, ""Isn't he the survival of the fittest guy?""; or at least make some reference to evolutionary theory. If the same people were asked, ""Who is Alfred Wallace?,"" they probably would furrow their brows and make some guess (""Isn't he the Braveheart guy?!"") or proclaim they had never heard of him. But Alfred Wallace (1823-1913) should get as much credit for formulating the theory of evolution as Darwin, and, I would guess, if he were pushed, more credit, according to James T. Costa, the author of Radical by Nature: The Revolutionary Life of Alfred Russel Wallace. *Costa's 419-page tome (not counting chapter notes, figure credits, and index) was written to mark the 200th anniversary of Wallace's birth. The author argues that Wallace is ""not well enough known"" in spite of many recent publications documenting Wallace's life and accomplishments (p. xi). Costa attempts to make this book unique in several ways. He hopes that what he has written is an updated story of Wallace's life; the book does include information from newly discovered notebooks and manuscripts. He also wanted this biography to explore Wallace's life ""as he lived it, in a narrative that traces the arc of the remarkable adventures, poignant personal life, and breathtaking sweep of thought of this singular human being"" (p. xi). Costa intentionally includes vivid descriptions of the landscapes and geology of the places where Wallace collected his vast number of specimens, as well as the cultural context of his life and work. *The biography begins with Wallace's life as a child. His family, although having limited finances, yet encouraged Wallace's innate creativity, reading, love of the outdoors, and intellectual exploration. It is clear that Wallace's keen sense of observation--particularly about place--was born along the River Usk in South Wales. As a young teen, Wallace traveled to London where he spent six years as a surveying apprentice. His curiosity and intellectual pursuits were nurtured in this environment in which he explored science--especially geology, entomology (he loved beetles!), and botany--in the Zoological Gardens and the Hall of Science. He even started lecturing and writing. *Costa's narrative about Wallace's first two decades of life includes not only information about how he was shaped as a scientist, but also how he was shaped politically and socially--especially by the Owenites, a utopian socialist group, known for promoting cooperation, free thinking, and social equality. They advocated a form of religion based on reason and human goodness. The Owenites were therefore unimpressed by societal hierarchies; their views likely emboldened Wallace to debate with anyone, regardless of social standing. Since Wallace was a self-trained biologist, his courage in engaging the scientific establishment probably stemmed, at least in part, from his interaction with the Owenites. *The majority of this book is dedicated to vivid and detailed descriptions of Wallace's travels, from South America to the Malay Archipelago. The level of detail, including lists and descriptions of collected species, may be overwhelming to some readers. I found the tales of the challenges Wallace faced, fascinating. I was captivated as I pictured how Wallace figured out ways to prevent ants from devouring his precious specimens; escaped shipwrecks; overcame disease, fire, hostile native peoples, injury; avoided snakes; and more. Through all the challenges, Wallace collected, preserved, and sent his specimens back to Great Britain, along with drawings, descriptions, travelogues, and scientific papers. Some of Wallace's drawings as well as photographs and other figures are scattered throughout the book. In the center, there is a section of color photographs from Wallace's notebooks, family portraits, and some of his most interesting collected species. *Costa masterfully reminds readers of the relationship between Wallace's early interest in geology and the theory he was formulating as he connected the places he was in and the species he was collecting. Wallace's deft mind was never satisfied with thinking about discoveries in isolation--everything was related, and he carefully looked for connections between landscape and the creatures that inhabited it. *Toward the end of Wallace's travels, the author nicely begins to unfold the relationship between Wallace and Darwin, including, obviously, the publication of their seminal papers outlining their theories of evolution by natural selection. Costa describes their relationship throughout the book as cordial, even friendly, with Wallace never tilting toward any jealousy that it is Darwin's name more than Wallace's that is so tightly connected to evolutionary theory--even when their papers were first published. I found the correspondence between these two brilliant men fascinating. Darwin was strongly supportive of Wallace's scientific efforts. *Wallace's return to Great Britain after almost two decades of travel did not mean he slowed down. In addition to avid gardening with his wife Annie, with whom he had two children, Wallace sorted, studied, wrote, and spoke. His writings included papers, books, letters, and more. He wrote about his vast collections, published his travelogue, wrote on human evolution, biogeography, and a coevolutionary framework for Earth and life (p. 289). His writings were not restricted to science. Wallace wrote about spiritualism quite extensively, much to the disappointment of the scientific community (p. 314). He even seems to fall prey to a God of the gaps theology (although more of an intellectual ""higher power"" of the gaps theology for Wallace) when he claimed that human brains were too complex to arise by evolution alone. *Wallace's writings also heralded social justice causes, harkening back to the influences of Owenites. His trip to the United States sparked interest in women's education and rights. During this trip, he traveled to California and met John Muir. These experiences were important in generating his new interest and in his writings about environmentalism, conservation, and land ethics. Toward the end of his life, he even began thinking and writing about extraterrestrial life. Wallace remained an active and vibrant scholar until his death at nearly 91 years old. His last two books were published during the last year of his life. *It's quite clear to me upon reading this biography that Costa is a ""Wallaceophile."" If I were to find something to criticize about this book (besides the sometimes-exhaustive descriptions of Wallace's collections), it would be that Costa is quite forgiving of any of Wallace's shortcomings. With the exception of chapter 12, ""A Tale of Two Wallaces?,"" in which Costa describes Wallace's extensive foray into spiritualism, Costa seems to write about Wallace in the most favorable light possible. Any suggestion, for example in Wallace's own writings, that he thinks of the people groups he encountered during his travels as less human than civilized Europeans, is excused. Perhaps Costa is right. Wallace was an extraordinary person, one I came to appreciate deeply after reading this book, but we all have our blind spots and Wallace was no exception. In spite of this, I recommend this book to anyone wanting a deeper understanding of one of the most important scientists of the 19th century. It gave me a profound appreciation of the physical danger involved in procuring such an extensive collection of species, the intellectual depth required to pull his vast observations and experiences into a compelling theory, and the intellectual risks Wallace was willing to take to synthesize all his life's experiences. Wallace's life is one worthy of a book of this length and detail. *Reviewed by Sara Sybesma Tolsma, professor of biology, North-western College, Orange City, IA 51041.",Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.56315/pscf3-25costa?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.56315/pscf3-25costa, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

906fbd9fa9eb69bfc9a2db61c54bced9e7b869ee,What Hath Darwin to Do with Scripture? Comparing the Conceptual Worlds of the Bible and Evolution,"WHAT HATH DARWIN TO DO WITH SCRIPTURE? Comparing the Conceptual Worlds of the Bible and Evolution by Dru Johnson. IVP Academic, 2023. vii + 224 pages. Paperback; $24.99. ISBN: 9781514003619. *Despite the book's title--What Hath Darwin to Do with Scripture?--this is not a typical origins book. For example, its author, Dru Johnson, does not lay out a specific biblical view of the creation narrative and then seek to show how mainstream scientific findings line up (or not) with this narrative. Rather, he starts off with the premise that both the scriptural and evolution narratives are founded on a single principle: becoming fit to live in a world where resources are in short supply. Survival, in each story, depends upon this ""fittedness."" Furthermore, since God is the Author of both narratives, then ""fittedness"" for life in each story should be consistent with God's character. But is it? That's the question that runs all the way through this book. On the one side, the book follows the biblical picture of what God states is necessary for Israel to thrive in the midst of scarcity. On the other side, it summarizes the author's understanding of the current state of evolutionary biology. Do the two stories reveal a commonality as we would expect if a single individual (God) is responsible for both? An all-important question, indeed. *Johnson is a biblical scholar, and his detailed summary of the central role of surviving-through-scarcity in Israel's history is a fascinating read. It starts with Genesis, proceeds through the exodus and on to the prophets, showing at each step what God expects if people are to thrive in a world where scarcity makes life very difficult. Nowhere is that laid out more clearly than in Deuteronomy 28 where the ramifications of obeying (and not obeying) God's commands are laid out in stark detail. Thriving in a world of scarcity is possible, but it requires living in worshipful harmony and obedience with the rules-for-living set out by God. That's the ancient story laid out by the biblical writers. *In considering life in a world where scarcity reigns, Johnson states that there are ""remarkable similarities between Darwin's version of natural selection and the biblical discourse on the same topics"" (p. 7). It is not that he necessarily thinks the two stories lead to the same conclusion about God. Rather, this is what he wants to test. By placing the way in which they are told against each other, the telling of these two stories ""can help us see unseen features that shape the world ... and they do so at least in part to convince us how to live. These are ethically freighted tales"" (p. 12). But is Johnson right about this? Are the goals of the biblical authors and the evolutionary scientists who explain evolution doing the same thing? Do the scientists seek to ""convince us how to live"" as they shape their story of the evolution of life on Earth? Some do, of course, but when they do so, have they not stepped out of the world of science and moved into the realm of philosophy or religion? The single most important purpose of the biblical story is to show us how we ought to live. What about determining how we ought to live from hearing the science story? Well, I think that is more complicated. *Nonetheless, Johnson's main point is well taken. If the Author of both books is one and the same, we should not expect major differences to arise as long as we are laying out each story correctly. I am a biologist, so I will restrict my comments largely to Johnson's description of evolutionary biology. But there is an important point related to the Bible I need to make from the start. He writes that the biblical view assumes ""a pivotal reorientation of the cosmos"" after the Fall (p. 4). Later Johnson expands on what he considers to be the ramifications of this view: Evolutionary biology assumes that ""the metaphysical nature of the universe remains unchanged. The laws of thermodynamics, gravity, electromagnetism, and the like persist. This means that biology plays in the same realm of physics as it always has"" (p. 35). In other words, before the biblical Fall (which was almost the entire span of billions of years during which life forms emerged according to evolutionary theory), the cosmos was functioning with a different set of natural laws. I am not a biblical scholar, but I know there is not unanimity on this point among Old Testament scholars. (See Iain Provan's 2014 book, Seriously Dangerous Religion, for example). Obviously, Johnson's view of the biblical story makes it difficult to take evolutionary theory seriously because all aspects of evolutionary theory have been formulated under the assumption that the cosmos has always operated under the same natural laws as it does today. Johnson thinks that the biblical authors assumed this was not the case. *Still, despite this initial skepticism brought on by his particular view of the biblical story, the book proceeds to describe Johnson's view of evolutionary theory. He correctly writes that Darwin stressed that competition for fittedness was the fundamental axiom of evolutionary theory. He is also correct to assert that, under certain circumstances, cooperation can be important too. But Johnson writes that this was not introduced into evolutionary theory until the 1930s, and that it conflicted with Darwin's original theory. Actually, it was Darwin himself who predicted that there would be circumstances when cooperation would come into play, even as Darwin correctly pointed out that this would not only not be in conflict with natural selection, it would actually be expected.1 Not only that, but it was Darwin who accurately predicted the concept of kin selection as the basis for altruism in certain circumstances. These concepts were not new to evolutionary theory, somehow proving Darwin wrong as Johnson implies. They were built into the theory of natural selection by Darwin himself almost from its earliest days.2 But natural selection was and still is at the heart of the theory--even in cases in which the most successful evolutionary strategy is cooperation. *Johnson refers to current evolutionary science as a ""moving target"" (p. 15), and he implies throughout the book that core foundations of evolution are still up for debate and reinterpretation. As a biologist, I don't see it that way, and to the extent that Johnson leaves this impression, I am left with some discomfort with his rendition of the story. Dobzhansky's famous sixty-year-old statement, ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution,"" is just as true today as it was when he first made it. On the other hand, if by ""moving target,"" he means that scientists are still working out the details, that would be an accurate summary of the current state of affairs, and that, after all, is the way science functions. I just wish he had made that clearer. This is especially important given that at several points (see the above discussion of the cosmic Fall), he expresses skepticism about evolutionary theory. His skepticism is also illustrated by this statement: ""Most of us are struggling with what to make of the ... fossil record, and that is a right and necessary struggle. The so-called natural history of our planet has a lot of explaining yet to do"" (p. 191). *Johnson does not explain who, or why, ""most of us are struggling"" with the fossil record, but by framing it in this manner and not explaining why he thinks this way, he is in danger of being perceived as not fully examining the evolutionary story he seeks to tell. Regardless of what some biblical scholars may think, evolutionary scientists think the fossil record provides a remarkably revealing picture of how life has unfolded on Earth over hundreds of millions of years. *Johnson spends quite a bit of time examining sexual reproduction in both the evolutionary and biblical accounts. He thinks that mammalian evolution (including our own hominin lineage) has been characterized by a long history of males forcing copulation on females. He cites a paper from 2006 in which forced copulation and/or sexual violence is the norm in guppies, ducks, and several species of flies, but that paper provides no evidence for its pervasiveness within the wider evolution story. More recently, a meta-review of mammalian sexual aggressiveness and coercion throughout the mammalian world identifies only four of thirty-two mammalian orders which have documented examples of such activity, and the author was able to identify only one species which represented a case in which sexual violence provided an adaptive advantage.3 Johnson's concern, of course, is that if such activity is the norm in the evolutionary story, it creates a conflict between evolutionary and biblical stories. However, we have no reason to think it is the norm. *Continuing his discussion of sexual reproduction, Johnson goes on to draw a conclusion about a particular evolutionarily strategy, one that is of special biblical interest--monogamy. He states, ""Monogamy is not evolutionary advantageous. It does not make sense"" (p. 136). Actually, there are various types of evolutionary reasoning that explain how monogamy does make evolutionary sense under certain circumstances. Frequently the advantages relate to the father's active involvement in parenting and retaining the sort of relationship that will ensure the offspring he is caring for are really his own. Indeed, one investigation suggests that the movement toward monogamy in human evolution (compared to our promiscuous ancestors of several million years ago) may have played a significant role in enabling the massive increase in brain size that characterizes our lineage.4 *As the book draws to a close, Johnson writes: ""Is there a way to reconcile entirely the Hebrew intellectual world to the present evolutionist accounts, theistic or otherwise? I am now less sure ... "" (p. 175).

c5c4a240bb91bb1e404efc283065020a4c131708,A Long-Term Study of Aerobic Performance in Elite Cross-Country Skiers: How Age and Sex Influence Career Development,"Introduction Elite cross-country (XC) skiers undergo standardized testing to monitor their performance development and to calibrate training prescriptions. However, the long-term progression of performance indicators, such as maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), performance at the second lactate threshold (LT2), and time-trial performance over an athlete's career remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal data from > 15 years of exercise testing with the Swiss XC ski national team to examine the trajectories of key performance indicators across the careers of male and female skiers.
Methods The longitudinal development of VO2max, LT2, and 24-minute double poling performance (24-min DP), described in further detail elsewhere (Bucher et al., 2023), was analyzed in 72 male and 49 female current and former Swiss XC-ski national team athletes. The performance trajectories were modeled using mixed-effects approaches, with a linear random intercept for VO2max, a linear random slope for LT2, and a third-degree polynomial for 24-min DP. Fixed effects included age, sex, and their interaction, with random effects at the individual level. The study included 357 observations (n = 27 females, 48 males) for VO2max, 911 (n = 46 females, 65 males) for LT2, and 601 (n = 49 females, 70 males) for 24-min DP.
Results VO2max in females tended to increase by 0.16 mL/kg/min per year (p=0.085), with no increase in males (0.03 ml/kg/min, p=0.627). Males had a higher baseline VO2max at age 18 (70.8 vs. 58.2 mL/kg/min, 21.6% difference), but the rate of change with age was not significantly different between the sexes (p=0.259). LT2 improved significantly with age for both sexes: females gained 0.038 W/kg per year (p<0.001) and males 0.052 W/kg per year (p<0.001). At age 18, males had a 23.2% higher baseline LT2 (3.34 vs. 2.71 W/kg). In the 24-min DP test, both sexes initially improved significantly (p<0.001). However, there was a notable decrease in the rate of improvement in males, as indicated by the quadratic age term (p<0.001). On the other hand, females showed a consistent linear performance trajectory throughout their careers, with no significant quadratic age term (p=0.430). Female skiers showed a baseline performance of 3820 m at age 18, while this value was at 4788 m in males, with males outperforming females by 968 m (25.3%).
Discussion/Conclusion VO₂max, LT2, and 24-min DP showed distinct developmental trajectories across age and sex in elite XC skiers. While VO₂max remained unchanged, LT2 continuously increased throughout their career. On the other hand, 24-min DP followed a non-linear progression in males, with a slowdown in performance improvement as they transitioned from the U23 to the senior age category. These results highlight the importance of high initial VO₂max at the junior level and the greater trainability of LT2 and aerobic time-trial performance with the accumulation of specific training as athletes progress in their careers.

There is growing concern over the future of the world’s water resources due to the astronomical population growth and human invasion of water catchment areas. It considered factors such as housing development, agricultural expansion; infrastructural development compounded by climate variability and relief factors. This study adopted the mixed research design as it combined both qualitative and qualitative research approaches. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used. Three satellite images of 1993, 2010 and 2023 were downloaded from the United State Geologic Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer and processed of portraying dynamics of human invasion (built-up expansion and agriculture) and implications on water catchments in the study. A total of 185 questionnaires were randomly administered to households living around catchments and 5 key informants were also interviewed. Questionnaire data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science Standard (SPSS version 23.0). Findings revealed that land cover around the catchments is increasingly dominated by agriculture (farmlands, palm plantations, tea estates and market gardening) which increased from 2872.71km in 1990 to 4406.16km in 2023. Also, settlement land increased from 596.95km in 1990 to 4029.70km in 2023 by use to meet the burgeon population. Water catchment yields over the years have increased from 1659840m3 in 2005 to 4643981.03m3 in the year 2023 but with increasing urbanization and variability of temperature and rainfall elements, the catchment areas are rapidly changing with severe human and environmental consequences. Crucially, the study found that continuous human encroachment has drastically reduced natural catchment areas, directly impacting potable water availability, with a significant correlation between land use changes and water yields. This unsustainable trajectory necessitates immediate policy interventions. Despite intervention efforts by communities, government agencies, NGOs, and international agencies—including reforestation, regulation enforcement, and infrastructure repairs to ensure the sustainability of water supply and management—challenges like rapid urbanization, climate change, and inadequate enforcement persist. Therefore, to ensure water sustainability, this study recommends establishing catchment buffer zones, enforcing land use regulations, optimizing water infrastructure, promoting sustainable agriculture and climate resilience, enhancing community engagement, and fostering collaborative resource management. A strategic land use planning policy is essential to reduce the harmful effects of anthropogenic activities around water catchments and ensure efficient water supply.",Journal of Geography Environment and Earth Science International,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.9734/jgeesi/2025/v29i2865', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.9734/jgeesi/2025/v29i2865?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.9734/jgeesi/2025/v29i2865, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 HERBARIUM PLANT SPECIMENS AND THEIR HERBARIUM HOLDINGS 
 
 Natural history collections around the globe represent a dormant source of taxonomic and biogeographic information, as it is estimated that one to three billion specimens are included in such collections (Soberon 1999; Ariño 2010). In the case of botanical collections, the worldwide distribution of specimens across herbaria is often uneven and biased by colonialism, with most specimens housed in the global North, and in many cases resulting in a reverse latitudinal relationship between plant diversity present in nature and the location of the herbaria housing it (Park et al. 2023). As an example, Yong (2013) reviewed holdings of common and type specimens and concluded that the type specimens’ accumulation in China is less than the world average. The number of type specimens is an important reflection of botanical accumulation in a country, and the number of specimens and their origins are therefore very important in a globalized framework. Accordingly, efforts to catalogue and digitize collections, and to make them globally accessible, are important tasks for herbaria.
 
 HERBARIA IN JAPAN AND THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO (TI) HERBARIUM
 
 In Japan, 74 herbaria are registered in Index Herbariorum (Thiers 2024), accounting for more than 13 million plant specimens. Herbaria in Japan date from the 19th century, with the first herbarium founded in Japan being the University of Tokyo’s (TI) herbarium (Herbarium of the University of Tokyo 2021) established in 1877. The herbarium holds a collection of more than 1,800,000 specimens of vascular plants, corresponding to ca. 14% of the total botanical collection of Japan. Although there is no complete survey of the number of specimens in the collection, it is estimated that the TI herbarium holds 20,000 type specimens, corresponding to 1% of the total number in the collection. Within the type specimens, only a fraction of the collection is digitized and available online, including 3,793 type specimens of angiosperms (and 1,743+ type specimens from other groups newly photographed in the last year). Regarding the ferns and lycophytes, the TI herbarium holds 35 families, including more than 300,000 specimens, comprising 1068+ type specimens (with 321 confirmed holotypes, 127 isotypes, and 510 syntypes), which are now being databased.
 The TI herbarium fern and lycophyte type collection includes plants from Japan, and important collections from Korea, Manchuria, Taiwan, and many Southeast Asian countries. Collections from outside Japan were mainly gathered by Japanese botanists that were assigned to expeditions in those countries, as Japan’s national power increased rapidly after the Meiji restoration (1869–1889). For example, Takiya Kawakami, originally from the Hokkaido University, actively worked on collecting plants from Taiwan; Hiroshi Hara worked on the Himalayan flora; Takenoshin Nakai worked on the Korean flora and collected medicinal plants from Indonesia and Ceylon (Sri Lanka); and Bunzo Hayata made a huge contribution to Taiwan’s flora. The specimens collected hold not only information on the taxonomic diversity, but also reflect historic events between Japan and these adjacent countries, thus proper curation of these materials is of great importance. The TI herbarium also holds unique collections, including many fern specimens collected from Seram Island (Indonesia), South America’s Andes collections by Fumio Maekawa, and Brazil’s Amazon collections by Masayuki Takeuchi.
 
 THE HIDDEN POTENTIAL OF THE TI HERBARIUM AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
 
 The TI herbarium collection is an important resource of natural history information, but its potential is still hindered by its incomplete databasing. In the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database, the Tracheophyta data from Japan currently consists of 3,503,623 herbarium specimens (GBIF.org 2024). Most of the data is from the TNS herbarium (500,060 specimens, National Museum of Nature and Science 2024), Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History (318,574 specimens, Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History 2024) and Nagano Environmental Conservation Research Institute (170,889 specimens, Nagano Prefecture 2023). The University of Tokyo's TI herbarium data only contains 40,382 specimens, not including any ferns or lycophytes, restricting access to the collection for researchers abroad. The TI herbarium mission now is to properly catalogue and make that information available, especially to those based in regions from where the plants were originally collected. Since 1981, many scientists have contributed to the cataloguing of the type specimens in the TI herbarium, with some of this data made available online. However, it is estimated that this database covers less than 10% of the collection, and does yet not include the ferns or lycophytes. We see the development of an open-access database for the TI herbarium as of utmost importance, as the herbarium represents an important historical and biodiversity account for East Asia.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.138439', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.138439?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.138439, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

209dd32abec6a622e1e9452651b03c1e6275c830,Modern problems of coast protection in Taganrog,"On the instructions of the Government of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Natural Resources of Rostov Region, in April-September 2023, the Southern Federal University and the Southern Scientific Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences carried out a study on the topic “Comprehensive survey of the coastal territory with justification of necessary measures to prevent the collapse of the coastline of the Taganrog Bay of the Sea of Azov”. An assessment of existing coastal protection structures has been carried out within the coastline of the city of Taganrog. A total of 27 structures were examined, with a total length of10.8 km. The coastal protection of the city is represented by various types of structures (passive, active, non- traditional). It was found that 55.8% of the coastal defenses length are classified as emergency and extremely emergency and do not perform their coastal protection functions. The methods that are still used to protect the shores are ineffective, and they are often harmful. In this regard, there is an urgent need to develop a general scheme of coastal protection and environmental management of the coast of Taganrog. In recreational areas, it is necessary to plan the creation of artificial beaches with retaining structures. Regulated backfilling of the beach material should be provided.

7b678947c0f4d012a1a57615560b3fdd3ed0f127,Obstetric Service Delivery Trends and Healthcare Staffing at a Teaching Hospital in Southwest Nigeria,"Background: Maternal health is a critical component of public health worldwide, reflecting a society's commitment to the well-being of its women and children. The provision of obstetric services, encompassing antenatal care, delivery and postnatal care, plays a pivotal role in reducing maternal mortality and ensuring positive birth outcomes. However, the quality and accessibility of obstetric services are influenced by various factors, including healthcare infrastructure, staffing levels and healthcare policies. Objective: To determine obstetric service delivery trends and healthcare staffing at a teaching hospital in southwest Nigeria Methodology: This study utilized a retrospective cohort design to examine the utilization of maternity care services among women at Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Data spanning from January 2016 to December 2023 were collected from obstetric records. Analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Results: a total of 9,855 deliveries were recorded, with 4,145 Caesarean sections and 5,767 spontaneous vaginal deliveries, giving a Caesarean section rate of 42%. Overall, there seems to be some fluctuations in the total number of deliveries over the years, with the highest number observed in 2019 (1482) and the lowest in 2021 (868). The number of consultants, senior residents, junior residents, house officers, nurses and other support staff varied over the years, with different staffing levels observed in each year. Conclusion: this study contributes to a better understanding of obstetric service delivery trends and healthcare staffing dynamics, offering valuable insights for healthcare resource allocation and policymaking. The findings underscore the importance of monitoring caseloads and staffing levels to ensure quality maternal and infant healthcare delivery.",International Journal of Medical Science and Clinical Research Studies,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ijmscr.org/index.php/ijmscrs/article/download/1625/1357', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47191/ijmscrs/v4-i05-19?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47191/ijmscrs/v4-i05-19, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

83dbef3c2b723a23f180be3f53c66d05fece8d62,Celebrating 50 Years of Excellence in DMD Science,"This issue of DMD marks the beginning of a year-long celebration of the 50 anniversary of the journal. The content of the first (Jan–Feb 1973) issue of DMD consisted entirely of the proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Microsomes and Drug Oxidations (MDO, https://MDO.pharmacy.arizona.edu), which took place in July 1972 at Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. The issue contained 64 articles and was literally a “book,” as it was referred to in the Preface of that issue, written by Ronald W. Estabrook, James R. Gillette, and Kenneth C. Leibman. The contributors to that issue included most, if not all, of the major figures in the drug metabolism field from that period. The Preface also credited the First MDO meeting, held in 1968 at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, for fueling the rapid growth of the scientific literature in the field of drug metabolism, which in turn led to the establishment of this new journal. The journal was titled Drug Metabolism and Disposition: the biological fate of chemicals, until 2000, when it became just Drug Metabolism and Disposition (DMD). The Editorial to launch the new journal by the founding Editor, Kenneth C. Leibman, was published in the second DMD issue (Leibman, 1973). The Editorial elegantly reviewed the history of drug metabolism studies, quoting Paracelsus and recounting the progression from Buchheim’s student Schmiedeberg to E. K. Marshall, R. T. Williams, and then B. B. Brodie and “the renaissance of interest in drug metabolism and disposition.” Dr. Liebman credited “the development of still more powerful techniques for the separation and characterization of drugs and their metabolites, and for probes of their molecular interactions with cellular constituents” for the “remarkable advances in our understanding of the fate of foreign chemicals in living matter and of the mechanisms of their biotransformation and translocation,” as well as the pressure to institute “new journals devoted exclusively to this subdiscipline.” The inaugural Editorial also expressed a wish to make DMD “an instrument of greatest usefulness to the community of workers in the field.” This noble wish has been an important guiding principle for the journal as it has stood the test of time and become the leading journal in the DMD field. Over the past 50 years, DMD has published nearly 9000 papers. It is the journal of choice for publishing first-rate fundamental as well as translational DMD research, where new trends, regulations, and concepts are introduced, differing opinions are debated, and important works from PhD dissertations and new drug approval pipelines are archived. The topics covered by DMD have evolved along with the rapid changes in the broader biomedical science fields. However, the focus on drug metabolism and disposition has remained true through the past 50 years. Frequency analysis of relevant title words of all papers published in the first 5 years and those published in the past 5 years suggests a dominance of studies on “rats” and “microsomes” in the early years and of studies on “drug”, “humans,” “transport,” and “pharmacokinetic models” in recent years. The words “metabolic” and “cytochrome/CYP” studies appeared to be equally well-represented in both periods (Fig. 1). The success of DMD can be attributed in part to the vision and leadership of its Editors. A total of eight individuals have had the opportunity to lead the journal in the last 50 years, as shown in Table 1. The journal’s success is also due to the combined efforts of everyone else involved, the Associate Editors (AEs), Editorial Advisory Board (EAB) members, reviewers, staff, ASPET Publications Committee and Council, and, perhaps most importantly, our authors, who placed their trust in the journal. Fig. 2 displays the last names that appeared 50 times or more as authors of a DMD article in the past 50 years. Particularly noteworthy are four authors who have published 80 or more papers in DMD (Table 2). Of these, Scott Obach is a current AE; Miki Nakajima is a current EAB member; Yuichi Sugiyama is being featured in a DMD special section on “Mechanism-Based Predictive Methods in Drug Discovery and Development” in 2023; and Curtis Klaassen was featured in a recent special section on “Bile Acids, Drug Metabolism, and Toxicity (https://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/ 50/4/422). A token of appreciation will be presented to each of them as “Most Prolific Author in DMD” in the near future. Congratulations! A number of special sections and commissioned articles are planned as a special 50 Anniversary Celebration Collection. The current (January) issue contains five papers from this collection. Fred Guengerich wrote an insightful historical as well as future perspective titled “Drug Metabolism: A Half-Century Plus of Progress, Continued Need, and New Opportunities” (Guengerich, 2022). Five former DMD editors (Edward T. Morgan, Raymond F. Novak, James R. Halpert, Eric F Johnson, and Jeffrey C. Stevens) have worked together and contributed unique and valuable perspectives on the evolution of the journal from 1994 to 2020 (Morgan et al., 2022). James R. Halpert and his former associates also provided a historical perspective on “Four Decades of CYP2B Research: From Protein Adducts to Protein Structures and Beyond” (Roberts et al., 2022). Hiroshi Yamazaki and Makiko Shimizu wrote a mini-review on “Species Specificity and Selection of Models for Drug Oxidations Mediated by Polymorphic Human Enzymes” (Yamazaki and Shimizu, 2022). Kerry B. Goralski and colleagues provided an ASPET symposium report on the very timely topic of “COVID-19 Vaccines and the Virus: Impact on Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics” (McColl et al., 2022). 96 1521-009X/51/1/96–98$35.00 dx.doi.org/10.1124/dmd.122.001179 DRUG METABOLISM AND DISPOSITION Drug Metab Dispos 51:96–98, January 2023 Copyright © 2022 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics",Drug Metabolism And Disposition,2022.0,4,"{'url': 'https://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/dmd/51/1/96.full.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1124/dmd.122.001179?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1124/dmd.122.001179, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7a177d931bedde0dca38f03e79dba01ac6545f13,ABAW: Learning from Synthetic Data & Multi-Task Learning Challenges,"This paper describes the fourth Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) Competition, held in conjunction with European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2022. The 4th ABAW Competition is a continuation of the Competitions held at IEEE CVPR 2022, ICCV 2021, IEEE FG 2020 and IEEE CVPR 2017 Conferences, and aims at automatically analyzing affect. In the previous runs of this Competition, the Challenges targeted Valence-Arousal Estimation, Expression Classification and Action Unit Detection. This year the Competition encompasses two different Challenges: i) a Multi-Task-Learning one in which the goal is to learn at the same time (i.e., in a multi-task learning setting) all the three above mentioned tasks; and ii) a Learning from Synthetic Data one in which the goal is to learn to recognise the basic expressions from artificially generated data and generalise to real data. The Aff-Wild2 database is a large scale in-the-wild database and the first one that contains annotations for valence and arousal, expressions and action units. This database is the basis for the above Challenges. In more detail: i) s-Aff-Wild2 -- a static version of Aff-Wild2 database -- has been constructed and utilized for the purposes of the Multi-Task-Learning Challenge; and ii) some specific frames-images from the Aff-Wild2 database have been used in an expression manipulation manner for creating the synthetic dataset, which is the basis for the Learning from Synthetic Data Challenge. In this paper, at first we present the two Challenges, along with the utilized corpora, then we outline the evaluation metrics and finally present the baseline systems per Challenge, as well as their derived results.

bf03a2867d1d1a00cfcb8cfb71818416540b7ca5,Strengthening Health Security through Sustainable Vaccine Economics and Equity,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted substantial inequities in access to vaccines. A primary reason behind this inequity was the concentration of manufacturing capacity in developed regions of the world. The lack of a distributed spread of local facilities has meant that many countries are reliant on global suppliers and manufacturers, making the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) vulnerable to pandemics.1 Addressing this imbalance in terms of accessibility to life-saving vaccines is crucial for health security and vaccine equity. 
Gavi’s new five-year strategy (Gavi 6.0’ for 2026–2030) aims to address these issues with a vision “leaving no one behind with immunisation”. GAVI mission was revised for Gavi 5.0 and puts ‘equity’ at the heart of the Alliance’s strategy to increase equitable and sustainable use of vaccines. GAVI 6.0 incorporates a new principle on the climate change while equity will remain at the core of Gavi’s next strategy, as a key contribution to the Immunisation Agenda 2030 (IA 2030) and the Sustainable Development Goals. At the heart of the Gavi model is also a unique approach to programmatic and financial sustainability.2 Grounded in Gavi’s eligibility, transition and co-financing (ELTRACO) policy, the model has been highly successful so far in bolstering country ownership of vaccine programmes and in driving domestic public resource allocation towards immunisation. From 2011 to 2023, countries increased their resources for Gavi-supported vaccines from US$ 36 million to US$ 630 million, representing 41% of the combined investment by Gavi and countries into routine, Gavi-supported vaccines. At the end of 2023, 19 countries had fully transitioned out of Gavi support. 
In line with Gavi’s vaccine policy, based on the country’s Gross National Income (GNI); Pakistan will eventually graduate from GAVI support which would result in added economic capitals to sustain the vaccine accessibility which are acquired as country co-financing share. Despite progress, immunisation coverage in Pakistan remains low, and the country has not met its 2015 health, nutrition, and population (HNP) Millennium Development Goals targets.4 Establishing a local vaccine manufacturing facility is imperative to reduce reliance on contract manufacturing and streamline the supply chain for the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) and health security. 
The BioNTech mRNA Vaccine Manufacturing Facility in Rwanda serves as a model for sustainable vaccine production in LMICs. With a $150 million investment and local personnel training, the facility aims to produce mRNA-based vaccines by 2025, promoting vaccine production and supply in African Union member states. Similar initiatives can be replicated regionally to enhance vaccine self-sufficiency.5 Currently, over 60% of BCG and over 80% of measles vaccines are produced in India and Indonesia, underscoring the need for Pakistan to develop its vaccine production capabilities. The domestic market’s annual vaccine intake is Rs 17.6 billion, indicating substantial demand and potential for local manufacturing.6 
Developing the capacity for essential immunisation in the country requires more than market-driven solutions. Achieving global vaccine equity demands transparency, active government oversight, favourable intellectual property policies, proactive technology transfers, and building regional technical, manufacturing, and regulatory capacities. Public-private partnerships (PPP) can expedite the establishment of Bioequivalence and Bioavailability centres, ensuring sustainable vaccine technology aligned with international standards (FDA, WHO, EU). By addressing these challenges, we can create a resilient and equitable global health security system, ensuring vaccine equity and sustainability in the fight against infectious diseases.

3a24c30fe0260e1ae7c80cc91ecf320e7c34f578,Parametric Optimization and Efficiency Assessment of Horizontal Earth Water Pipe Heat Exchanger (EWPHE) in the Context of Bangladesh,"This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the Earth Water Pipe Heat Exchanger (EWPHE) system in Bangladesh through simulation and experimental work carried out at Joypurhat in Bangladesh during the coldest period of the year, January. Additionally, the study sought to establish the method for selecting optimal installation parameters of EWPHE to increase performance and efficiency. A simulation model was made in the TRNSYS (v16.0) platform to determine the optimum values of design parameters. The simulation was run by altering its operating parameters, such as the rate of water flow, length of the pipe, built materials of the pipe, and the diameter of the underground pipeline. According to the findings, pipe burial can be done to a depth of 3.5 meters to achieve optimal output. The results of comparing four distinct materials, namely GI, Steel, PVC, and HDPE, show that these materials' characteristics do not significantly affect how well the systems perform. Additionally, as the water flow rate is increased, it is shown that the EWPHE performance is declining. According to the simulation results, it is concluded that a pipe with a length of 50 meters would be sufficient in the proposed EWPHE system to reach an average temperature decrease from 35 °C to 27 °C. Subsequently, in the field experiment, the EWPHE system had an average efficacy of 55% throughout January, which is quite promising.

d6cd5dd4ef5b0301cb78202f6641800cd70901c2,The UWI Zoology Museum and Bioblitzing in Trinidad & Tobago: Mutual Benefits,"In 2012, as Zoology Curator for the University of the West Indies Zoology Museum (UWIZM), based at the St. Augustine campus in Trinidad and Tobago, I ran the first ever bioblitz to be held in Trinidad. Since then, an event has been conducted annually. Each event is organised mainly by staff and students in The University of the West Indies (UWI) Department of Life Sciences alongside members of the Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists' Club (TTFNC). A typical event would follow this basic format: choose a new location each year, find a basecamp, set up a search area (usually a 5 km radius circle), promote the event, organise survey teams, start surveying on a Saturday, invite the public along on a Sunday to get involved and then announce the results.
 Over the years, the bioblitzes have been attended and/or assisted by more than 30 groups and organisations. These included long-established bodies such as the Asa Wright Nature Centre, the Pointe-a-Pierre Wildfowl Trust, and the Zoological Society of Trinidad and Tobago; government bodies like the Institute of Marine Affairs, the Forestry Division and the Environmental Management Authority; and newer, smaller groups such as Trinibats, Turtle Village Trust, Environmental Research Institute Charlotteville (ERIC), the Reptile Conservation Center Of Trinidad and Tobago and The El Socorro Centre for Wildlife Conservation (ECWC) (Fig. 1).
 The way these groups contributed to the events varied from being basecamp hosts to providing animal encounter experiences, and from granting access to land and giving permits to providing expert wildlife surveyors. Organisations were usually approached by me with an invitation to join a bioblitz, depending on the needs and location of the event. Sponsors for the events were found by writing to local companies, approaching those who already had community funding programmes in place.
 I left the role of UWIZM curator in 2019, but the Trinidad and Tobago Bioblitz continued and evolved. In 2019, it followed the same pattern as previous events: the organisers partnered with a local school for a basecamp and the usual participants surveyed and welcomed the public. However, in 2020 with the first COVID lockdown, they had to adapt and so changed the bioblitz into an event facilitated online by using the iNaturalist platform: T&T Bioblitz 2020 Backyard Edition. At this stage, people were restricted to their gardens or streets so observation opportunities were limited, but nevertheless there were around 6,500 observations made of almost 1,400 species over one weekend in November.
 In 2021, restrictions were still in place for large gatherings but people could travel more widely, so the same online format was repeated. Observations could be made in some of the locations of previous events, which led to 2,900 observations and just over 1,000 species. For 2022, the event stayed online but became the Inter-Island Bioblitz as it went regional with participants from Jamaica and Barbados being invited. Almost 600 people took part and recorded over 1,300 species. Finally, in 2023, the bioblitz returned to the original format and an in-person event was again possible; this continued into 2024.
 The recording of results changed over the years. For example, the use of iNaturalist went from 9 observations in 2012 to over 6,500 observations in 2020. As I was no longer resident in Trinidad, I couldn't take part directly but though iNaturalist, I could contribute by identifying observations, as could many other international identifiers. 
 The majority of records made during the events were observations rather than the collection of specimens, but for some groups it was necessary to collect for further identification. Specimens collected were mostly terrestrial invertebrates, although sometimes roadkill and other specimens found dead during the events were also added to the UWIZM collections.
 After each bioblitz, a large banner was produced showing a summary of the results (Fig. 2). These were displayed at subsequent events and also as part of other displays in the UWIZM. Likewise, the trails and quizzes made for the bioblitzes were often used during the rest of the year for school groups visiting the UWIZM.
 Both in the lead up to a bioblitz and in the weeks following the event, the results are promoted in several ways: on social media (Facebook at first and later Instagram and Twitter), in national newspapers, on TV (usually getting a slot on a morning show), and through the TTFNC's Quarterly Bulletin, the final edition of the year being dedicated to that year's bioblitz.

39162965e7c0967f0a7822c7cdfbcb3981b14bbc,STATISTICAL METHODS FOR PREDICTING PHISHING ATTACKS,"The article proposes a methodology for predicting so-called phishing attacks, which are a common form of cybercrime, the number of which is growing every year, and the level of their harmful impact on the information systems of critical infrastructure objects is also increasing. To analyze trends and predict phishing attacks, we used statistical data published in scientific works of domestic and foreign researchers, as well as published by online publications of leading consulting companies working in the field of information security and cybersecurity. Statistical methods based on the use of time series, as one of the popular approaches used to predict various technological and economic processes, were chosen as tools for researching and predicting phishing attacks. This made it possible to analyze the types and patterns of phishing attacks that attackers use to disrupt the operation of software of information and communication systems and automated systems. Based on time series analysis, a trend model was built for the number of detected phishing attacks for the period 2020–2023. A calculation was made of the predicted number of phishing attacks for 16 quarters of 2020–2023, as well as the estimated forecast of the occurrence of these attacks for four quarters of 2024. To improve the forecast, a coefficient taking into account the seasonality factor was calculated and a correlation and regression analysis of the impact of phishing attacks on the total number of attacks detected during 2020–2023 was performed. Calculations have been performed, indicating that the discrepancies in the predicted values are not significant; the results presented allow us to select the optimal strategy for identifying, predicting and eliminating computer attacks related to phishing. Based on the time series model and the calculations obtained, it was concluded that statistical forecasting methods make it possible to build a forecast of phishing attacks, provide in the future the opportunity to develop and formulate methods for countering these attacks, and plan measures to increase the level of security of information resources.","Cybersecurity: Education, Science, Technique",2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://csecurity.kubg.edu.ua/index.php/journal/article/download/561/439', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.28925/2663-4023.2024.23.5670?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.28925/2663-4023.2024.23.5670, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3a24c30fe0260e1ae7c80cc91ecf320e7c34f578,Parametric Optimization and Efficiency Assessment of Horizontal Earth Water Pipe Heat Exchanger (EWPHE) in the Context of Bangladesh,"This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the Earth Water Pipe Heat Exchanger (EWPHE) system in Bangladesh through simulation and experimental work carried out at Joypurhat in Bangladesh during the coldest period of the year, January. Additionally, the study sought to establish the method for selecting optimal installation parameters of EWPHE to increase performance and efficiency. A simulation model was made in the TRNSYS (v16.0) platform to determine the optimum values of design parameters. The simulation was run by altering its operating parameters, such as the rate of water flow, length of the pipe, built materials of the pipe, and the diameter of the underground pipeline. According to the findings, pipe burial can be done to a depth of 3.5 meters to achieve optimal output. The results of comparing four distinct materials, namely GI, Steel, PVC, and HDPE, show that these materials' characteristics do not significantly affect how well the systems perform. Additionally, as the water flow rate is increased, it is shown that the EWPHE performance is declining. According to the simulation results, it is concluded that a pipe with a length of 50 meters would be sufficient in the proposed EWPHE system to reach an average temperature decrease from 35 °C to 27 °C. Subsequently, in the field experiment, the EWPHE system had an average efficacy of 55% throughout January, which is quite promising.

d6cd5dd4ef5b0301cb78202f6641800cd70901c2,The UWI Zoology Museum and Bioblitzing in Trinidad & Tobago: Mutual Benefits,"In 2012, as Zoology Curator for the University of the West Indies Zoology Museum (UWIZM), based at the St. Augustine campus in Trinidad and Tobago, I ran the first ever bioblitz to be held in Trinidad. Since then, an event has been conducted annually. Each event is organised mainly by staff and students in The University of the West Indies (UWI) Department of Life Sciences alongside members of the Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists' Club (TTFNC). A typical event would follow this basic format: choose a new location each year, find a basecamp, set up a search area (usually a 5 km radius circle), promote the event, organise survey teams, start surveying on a Saturday, invite the public along on a Sunday to get involved and then announce the results.
 Over the years, the bioblitzes have been attended and/or assisted by more than 30 groups and organisations. These included long-established bodies such as the Asa Wright Nature Centre, the Pointe-a-Pierre Wildfowl Trust, and the Zoological Society of Trinidad and Tobago; government bodies like the Institute of Marine Affairs, the Forestry Division and the Environmental Management Authority; and newer, smaller groups such as Trinibats, Turtle Village Trust, Environmental Research Institute Charlotteville (ERIC), the Reptile Conservation Center Of Trinidad and Tobago and The El Socorro Centre for Wildlife Conservation (ECWC) (Fig. 1).
 The way these groups contributed to the events varied from being basecamp hosts to providing animal encounter experiences, and from granting access to land and giving permits to providing expert wildlife surveyors. Organisations were usually approached by me with an invitation to join a bioblitz, depending on the needs and location of the event. Sponsors for the events were found by writing to local companies, approaching those who already had community funding programmes in place.
 I left the role of UWIZM curator in 2019, but the Trinidad and Tobago Bioblitz continued and evolved. In 2019, it followed the same pattern as previous events: the organisers partnered with a local school for a basecamp and the usual participants surveyed and welcomed the public. However, in 2020 with the first COVID lockdown, they had to adapt and so changed the bioblitz into an event facilitated online by using the iNaturalist platform: T&T Bioblitz 2020 Backyard Edition. At this stage, people were restricted to their gardens or streets so observation opportunities were limited, but nevertheless there were around 6,500 observations made of almost 1,400 species over one weekend in November.
 In 2021, restrictions were still in place for large gatherings but people could travel more widely, so the same online format was repeated. Observations could be made in some of the locations of previous events, which led to 2,900 observations and just over 1,000 species. For 2022, the event stayed online but became the Inter-Island Bioblitz as it went regional with participants from Jamaica and Barbados being invited. Almost 600 people took part and recorded over 1,300 species. Finally, in 2023, the bioblitz returned to the original format and an in-person event was again possible; this continued into 2024.
 The recording of results changed over the years. For example, the use of iNaturalist went from 9 observations in 2012 to over 6,500 observations in 2020. As I was no longer resident in Trinidad, I couldn't take part directly but though iNaturalist, I could contribute by identifying observations, as could many other international identifiers. 
 The majority of records made during the events were observations rather than the collection of specimens, but for some groups it was necessary to collect for further identification. Specimens collected were mostly terrestrial invertebrates, although sometimes roadkill and other specimens found dead during the events were also added to the UWIZM collections.
 After each bioblitz, a large banner was produced showing a summary of the results (Fig. 2). These were displayed at subsequent events and also as part of other displays in the UWIZM. Likewise, the trails and quizzes made for the bioblitzes were often used during the rest of the year for school groups visiting the UWIZM.
 Both in the lead up to a bioblitz and in the weeks following the event, the results are promoted in several ways: on social media (Facebook at first and later Instagram and Twitter), in national newspapers, on TV (usually getting a slot on a morning show), and through the TTFNC's Quarterly Bulletin, the final edition of the year being dedicated to that year's bioblitz. A T&T bioblitz website was made, which allowed us to collate all these outputs as well as access to the final reports for each event.
 Bioblitzes are fantastic events that bring together naturalist experts and the public.

Foreword
Volume 4 of Aestimatio brings with it several important changes that our readers may well want to take note of. To begin, we will no longer publish the two issues of a volume when each is complete. From now on, the items constituting the volume for a given year will be put online as they are ready. This will entail some minor changes in our website (https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/aestimatio). But, so far as our readers are concerned, we anticipate in the neighborhood of 22 items per volume.
Next, we have just about completed the installation of the submission module that comes with Open Journal System that we use for putting the journal online. Since we already have much of the contents of volume 4 in hand, this volume will be a hybrid, effectively giving us time to test the module. We will let you know when the module is fully operational. For volume 5, we will require that all contributions to Aestimatio be made using this module.
As you might expect, the implementation and management of the module and, more generally, of Aestimatio is a challenging and time-consuming task, and so we are delighted that Olivier Séguin-Brault, a graduate student in French literature of the 16th century at the Université du Québec à Rimouski / Université de Tours (UQAR/CESR), has agreed to join us as our new Managing Editor. He will be working with our OJS Manager, Hossein Gholizadeh, to facilitate the online operation of the journal.
Olivier will also help us by translating our OJS website into French, so that users will have the choice of accessing the site in French or English. This will be an important step in our ongoing effort to publicize Aestimatio, that is, to make your contributions more accessible. To the same end, once this stage of work on the site itself is finished, we will establish accounts in various of the social media to be used for distributing announcements and notifications concerning Aestimatio and its publisher, the IRCPS.
Finally, in accordance with the changes in our model for publication, we will no longer have special issues; indeed, there will no longer be issues, only volumes. Accordingly, instead of the special issues, when we have the content, we will create a section of the volume at hand that is devoted to a single topic and edited by guest editor. As before, we warmly encourage our readers to organize and submit plans for these focal sections.

61351ed7438b44c394db8ea2640fd53fe2c08040,243 Community-Campus Research Incubator (CCRI) Grant Program: 13 years of partnerships improving community health,"OBJECTIVES/GOALS: With the knowledge that population health will not improve without including community voices in research, analysis of the UCI Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) Community-Campus Research Incubator (CCRI) grants awarded since 2010 provides the foundation for understanding research partnerships impact on community health. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Over the past 13 years, the UCI ICTS CCRI program has funded 63 partnered research pilot or capacity-building projects, providing up to $30K annually to academic-community partnerships. Each year since 2010, between 3 and 7 projects were funded up to $5,000 annually for capacity-building activities and up to $10,000 annually for pilot research activities. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a collaboration between the UCI ICTS and the local Healthcare Agency provided up to $20,000 to research partnership teams to study impact and interventions related to the pandemic, where 10 CCRI awards were given out. Evaluations of these research teams was completed at the end of the project, and at years 2 and 3 after the project ended. Analysis of the projects and partnerships aim to reveal the impact of these projects. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In 2023, we compiled all evaluation data collected from 2010 – 2023 from the CCRI partnership grants, including traditional metrics of publications, subsequent grant applications submitted & awarded, presentations given, and return on investment for ICTS granted funds. Less traditional metrics include number of students trained, new tools or databases created, knowledge disseminated, and advances in clinical care. Since 2020, Translational Science Benefit Model metrics have been collected on community, policy, economic, and clinical domains. Since 2015, data on each CCRI partnership has been collected at the start and end of each project, with questions about attributes of each partner, trust, community engagement principles, and anticipated/actual impact of each project. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Organizing outcomes from the data collected will provide deep understanding of important components, functioning, and types and reach of partnered health research. This understanding will inform future action of the CCRI program in terms of what can be accomplished with a given amount of funding, and the constitution of successful partnerships.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/6E5558AE1010AAB47E7E2739647AC4C5/S2059866124002243a.pdf/div-class-title-243-community-campus-research-incubator-ccri-grant-program-13-years-of-partnerships-improving-community-health-div.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11033756, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Looking back on the last year, I would like to thank the global measurement community for their continued support for Measurement Science and Technology. This year has been another successful year for the journal. Both our submission and acceptance rates have increased as well as the number of articles downloaded having increased by nearly 20%. The impact factor has increased to 2.398. Our Editorial Team is mindful of authors’ desire to publish work as quickly as possible while still ensuring work undergoes a rigorous refereeing process. With this in mind, the articles are published online with a DOI within 24 hours of acceptance. As ever we have continued to publish topical reviews giving comprehensive overviews of areas of measurement. This year we have published eleven reviews covering a wide range of topics: electromechanical resonators for sensing fluid density and viscosity, high speed imaging for x-ray computer tomography, seismography, thermometry, aeroacoustics, magnetic position sensing, digital holography, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) supporting geotechnical monitoring and nanotechnology used for sensing SARS-CoV-2. The breadth of topics strongly reflects not only the diversity of the journal, but also exemplifies a common theme of excellence in measurement science. Our Special Issues have also been popular. This year they have covered, metrology for additive manufacturing, acoustics in measurement, industrial vision and automation, measurement-based decision making in structural health monitoring, pressure-sensitive and temperature-sensitive paints for measuring high speed and unsteady flows. The Special Issue on metrology in manufacturing highlighted the industrial importance of metrology. The journal has also continued to publish a few design notes describing small pieces of work. A collection of six Emerging Leaders articles have been published bringing together work from some of the best early-career researchers in measurement and metrology [1–6]. This year also saw the publication of our first road map [7]. It covered the important area of signal processing for next generation measurement systems; something that relates to almost every area of measurement. This road map was followed up by a successful webinar where several authors gave presentations on their contributions. A road map on imaging is in preparation for publication in 2023. As with previous years, awards were made for Outstanding Papers [8]. This year awards were presented in the areas of optical and laser-based techniques [9], sensors and sensing systems [10], precision measurement [11] and fluid mechanics [12].",Measurement science and technology,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6501/ac9995', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1361-6501/ac9995?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6501/ac9995, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

70f43eba8f664d1d1fb8e17adc13b3317927c34c,RIP Twitter API: A eulogy to its vast research contributions,"Since 2006, Twitter's Application Programming Interface (API) has been a treasure trove of high-quality data for researchers studying everything from the spread of misinformation, to social psychology and emergency management. However, in the spring of 2023, Twitter (now called X) began changing $42,000/month for its Enterprise access level, an essential death knell for researcher use. Lacking sufficient funds to pay this monthly fee, academics are now scrambling to continue their research without this important data source. This study collects and tabulates the number of studies, number of citations, dates, major disciplines, and major topic areas of studies that used Twitter data between 2006 and 2023. While we cannot know for certain what will be lost now that Twitter data is cost prohibitive, we can illustrate its research value during the time it was available. A search of 8 databases and 3 related APIs found that since 2006, a total of 27,453 studies have been published in 7,432 publication venues, with 1,303,142 citations, across 14 disciplines. Major disciplines include: computational social science, engineering, data science, social media studies, public health, and medicine. Major topics include: information dissemination, assessing the credibility of tweets, strategies for conducting data research, detecting and analyzing major events, and studying human behavior. Twitter data studies have increased every year since 2006, but following Twitter's decision to begin charging for data in the spring of 2023, the number of studies published in 2023 decreased by 13% compared to 2022. We assume that much of the data used for studies published in 2023 were collected prior to Twitter's shutdown, and thus the number of new studies are likely to decline further in subsequent years.",arXiv.org,2024.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07340, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d02feb7578e1049893fa1c574a9d224a46b1071f,Influence of Seeding Rates and Nutrition Conditions on the Yield of Soft Wheat on Ridge Sowings under Irrigated Conditions,"The research was carried out in a 2-factor (3x3) field experiment on ridge crops of the Tartar regional experimental station of the Azerbaijan Research Institute of Agriculture under the irrigation conditions of the Karabakh plain and the results obtained are presented in the article. The object of the study was the soft wheat variety Onur. Three variants of each factor were studied against the background of seeding rates and nutritional conditions. So, the seeding rate is 2 million/pcs. (90-100 kg/ha), 3 million/piece. (130-140 kg/ha) and 4 million/piece. (170-180 kg/ha), and against the background of nutritional conditions, the studies were carried out by experiment in 3 replications in the variant without fertilizers, N90P60 and N120P90. The crop was collected directly by a combine at the full ripening phase for each replicate, and after harvesting, the yield was determined by weighing the crop. Based on the results obtained, an analysis of variance was carried out using the Spss 26 computer program. Thus, according to the average 3-year research result for the 2020-2023 growing season, it was established that sowing rates and nutritional conditions are important in increasing the grain yield of soft wheat. Thus, as the seeding rate increased, the yield increased, but after reaching the optimal rate, increasing the rate reduced the yield. Against the background of nutritional conditions, an increase in productivity was observed with an increase in the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus by 30 kg due to the active substance. As a result of the experiment, optimal seeding rates and nutritional conditions were established, the fertilizer rate N120P90was introduced at a seeding rate of 3 million/pcs (130-140 kg/ha), the yield of the soft wheat variety Onur was 68.2 c/ha.",Bulletin of Science and Practice,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33619/2414-2948/112/37?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33619/2414-2948/112/37, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of pediatric B-ALL patients who received blinatumomab treatment from Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from August 2021 to October 2023. Based on their disease status, the patients were divided into refractory/relapsed(RR) group, minimal residual disease clearance (MC) group, and chemotherapy intolerance (IC) group. Clinical data of the children were collected to evaluate the adverse drug reactions, therapeutic efficacy and survival of the children. In total, 35 patients were included, with 20 males and 15 females, aged from 0.6 to 16.4 (9.9±4.2) years old. There were 10 cases in the RR group, 20 cases in the MC group and 5 cases in the IC group. A total of 56 cycles of infusion were completed, with one cycle in 24 cases, two cycles in 5 cases, three cycles in 2 cases and four cycles in 4 cases. The median infusion time [M (Q1, Q3)] from the first to the fourth cycle was 14 (14, 28) days, 28 (28, 28) days, 28 (28, 28) days and 28 (26, 28) days, respectively. In terms of adverse reactions, the incidence of grade 1-2 cytokine release syndrome(CRS) was 57.1% (32/56), with grade 1 CRS accounting for 84.4% (27/32). The incidence rate of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome(ICANS) (grade 4) was 1.8% (1/56). In the RR group, 6 cases were treated effectively, and minimal residual disease(MRD) turned negative, before treatment, MRD levels were all less than 20%. Among them, 3 cases had MRD turning positive again 14 to 42 days after discontinuation of Belintoumab. Four cases were treated ineffectively, with MRD >20% before treatment. All MRD positive cases in MC group turned negative and all MRD negative cases in the IC group remained negative after treatment.

This paper investigates high photovoltaic energy penetration impacts voltage regulation and dynamic performance of the grid. Load flow analysis is implemented to investigate the power system capability for the case of incorporating the desired photovoltaic power. Computer-based simulations have been used for evaluating the upgradation of the grid. Moreover, the study is based on bifurcation diagrams taking the photovoltaic generation as a bifurcation parameter and time response simulations to grid disturbances. Professional PSAT simulation toolbox has been used for the power flow simulation studies. Network- related faults like outage of photovoltaic farm event, three-phase short-circuit at a conventional bus, and voltage dip at the largest photovoltaic station have been considered. It is hoped that the results of the presented study would benefit Tunisian’s utility’s policies on integration of PV systems.

Valsalva was a leading physician across the seventeenth and the eighteenth century, specifically for his focus on experimental physiology, the science dealing with the normal functioning of bodily organs as a basis for a better understanding of diseases, symptoms, and care. He used a top-down systematic approach typical of the Enlightenment, rather than a heuristic one (""trial-and-error""), which became feasible after the long-lasting ban on dissecting human corpses was lifted. Valsalva's main interest was exploring the complex structure of the human ear, to which he dedicated a specific treatise, ""De Aure Humana"". He understood the issues inherent in the imbalance in pressure between outer and inner ear, and found ways how to exploit it to get rid of purulent fluid, by deliberately raising the inside pressure with his maneuver. Time was however not yet ripe to see the broader importance that the Valsalva maneuver would achieve, not just in otorhinolaryngology, but also in cardiology and other fields of medicine. Although Valsalva's name is usually associated his maneuver, his contributions to the history of medicine were broader: he discovered several anatomical parts (i.e. the sinuses of Valsalva), built the basis for the development of pathological anatomy, introduced advances in surgery, promoted a compassionate care of patients affected by mental diseases.",Advances in Physiology Education,2022.0,2,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00126.2022', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1152/advan.00126.2022?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00126.2022, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To gain an understanding of the nuances of this concept, it is enough to delve into just one topic of elementary school mathematics curriculum. Select an arbitrarily unit segment, build two segments with lengths of ordinary fractions with different denominators and make sure that it is impossible to compare them in length in numerical terms. Then, appreciate the remarkable ability of Mathematics, to provide a solution to what would otherwise appear to be an insoluble problem. 

In the educational process, it is essential to differentiate between the state and the student. The first provides the opportunity to obtain knowledge, but is not to answer for the second. However, there must be moral and material motivation to obtain high-quality knowledge. In his teachings, wise Abay cautioned that the word from the educated though demanding, can illuminate the path to understanding. He urged to perceive the light and mystery that surrounds us. With his words ""Aitshy-aytshyp zhalynar, Uqqysh zhansyp shabynar. Uqpay zhatyp zhalyǵar, uıqyly-oıaý boıkúıez"", which translates as ‘mindless boredom, drowsiness’, he emphasised the importance of remaining alert and awake to the world around us. In the absence of boredom, sleepiness"", as in the case of personal transformation of the individual and the principle of ""you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink"". 

The concept of ""Justice"" is a multifaceted topic in the International Educational Space. It is the universal division between ""Global North"" and the ""Global South"", where the former has a stronger economy, infrastructure and technology, while the latter is characterized by less diverse economy, by poverty and inequality and a history of colonization by the countries of the Global North. These studies adopt from various points of views: sociological, economic, pedagogical, legal and political, as well as various professional approaches such as ""Fair education from the standpoint of textbook quality"" or ""Development and implementation of programs that take into account the needs of different groups of students"", ""Evaluation of the effectiveness of pedagogical strategies aimed at eliminating educational inequality"", and ""The role of technology in providing access to education"", etc.

Community Colleges are notable for their diversity and heterogenous student population, but also for the workforce's influence to disseminate specific curriculum requirements. Therefore, community colleges offer a large variety of computing programs, including computer science degrees, notably Associate in Science (AS) and Arts (AA) (a.k.a. academic transfer degrees). Ideally, these transfer degrees align learning outcomes, objectives, and competencies to the ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines, mainly to create two-year programs, align curricula and ease transferability to four-year colleges. Due to the nature of these degrees, computer science education at the lower-division undergraduate level faces curriculum challenges and emerging opportunities while adopting curricular guideline recommendations. Some of these include the number of transfer hours, the scope of topics in computer science, and the most recent ABET accreditation efforts at the community college level. This discussion aims to identify and recognize additional significant challenges that computer science programs in community colleges face, particularly while adopting curricular guidelines recommendations, such as CS 2023.

Addressing AFR requires a One Health approach including Antifungal Ste-wardship (AFS). This study aimed to comprehensively review global studies published on fungal infections and AFR and to recommend solutions to address this growing problem. Materials and Methods: This was a narrative review that was conducted using published papers on fungal infections, AFR, and AFS between January 1961 and March 2024. The literature was searched using PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Results: This found that there has been an increase in fungal infections globally, especially among immunocompromised patients. Due to this increase in fungal infections, there has been a proportionate increase in the use of antifungal agents to prevent and treat fungal infections. This increased use of antifungal agents has worsened the problem of AFR contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Globally, fungal infections have contributed to 150 million infections annually and 1.7 million deaths per year. By the year 2023, over 3.8 million people died from fungal infections. Addressing AFR remains a challenge because the treatment of antifungal-resistant infections is difficult. Finally, the treatment of fungal infections is a global challenge exacerbated by the limited number of antifungal agents to treat invasive fungal infections. Con-clusion: The results of this study indicated that fungal infections and AFR are prevalent across humans, animals, agriculture, and the environment.

It is noted that from the 2022/2023 academic year, the gradual implementation of the State Standard of Basic Secondary Education will begin, accordingly, students of general secondary education institutions, in particular 6th grade, will switch to a new learning model, a component of which is a new system for evaluating students' educational achievements. It is indicated that taking into account the experience of formative assessment in elementary school and ensuring continuity in assessment approaches is important for the implementation of the tasks of geographic education in all cycles of education. Separate techniques and tools of formative assessment that can be used in geography lessons are singled out and analyzed. Examples of exercises that are used at different stages of the lesson during formative assessment are given, including the games ""Play in groups with a map"", ""Catch the cartographer's mistake"", ""Find the extra word"". It is noted that in the process of teaching geography and evaluating the educational achievements of students, the teacher can use such techniques of written control as: geographical dictation with mutual control, ""blitz control"", ""self-checking on the informant's card"", solving crosswords. To establish the expediency of using crosswords as a formative assessment of educational achievements, a survey of 9th grade students was conducted, the results of which indicate an interest in this type of control. Non-traditional forms and methods of testing students' knowledge and skills using computer technologies, which can serve as a tool for formative assessment, are considered. Our observations of students' activity confirm the feasibility of using separate online services in geography lessons for formative assessment of both the learning process and the result of students' educational achievements. In particular, the use of such online services with the use of test verification is effective for testing students' knowledge of geography. as ""For Lesson""; Kahoot!; Online Test Pad, as well as Gartic Phone game technologies.

9f7966a2cd6c07fa20193e175fea1124d423c4d9,Bibliometric development of Naunyn–Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology,"Motivated by the 150-year anniversary of the Naunyn–Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology in 2023, we studied the bibliometric development of the journal. We evaluated data from Editorial Reports, Clarivate, and Springer Nature databases. Several parameters representing the journal’s performance, such as the impact factor and social impact, were analyzed over the years. We analyzed the journal’s meta-data and wrote an algorithm to retrieve cities and countries of origin. We could see a decrease in publications from Germany and an increase in papers from Brazil, China, Egypt, and Iran during the last years. The decrease in publications from Germany is probably a zeitgeist effect because this country places a strong emphasis on high-impact factor papers for academic promotion and winning grants. Germany was the country with the most publications throughout the 100 most-cited articles. Most of these articles were published between 1970 and 1990, when neurotransmitters were the most published topic. Klaus Starke (Freiburg) and Manfred Göthert (Bonn) were prominent drivers of this field. The most common topics nowadays are “Drugs for the Treatment of Malignant Tumor Diseases” and “Immunopharmacology.” The internationality of the journal substantially increased after introduction of English as mandatory language in the 1970s. The journal also experienced substantial COVID-19 pandemic-related effects. This paper is not only of relevance for the field of pharmacology but for science in general in the sense that Naunyn–Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology is a case study for profound changes in a traditional scientific journal, requiring permanent adjustment by editors, referees, publisher, authors, and readers alike. The development of the journal has been strongly influenced by historic and political developments, cultural attitudes ( zeitgeist ), language changes, global changes in research topics, and eminent individuals who published many papers in Naunyn–Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology .",Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology,2022.0,8,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00210-022-02307-2.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9592544, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3155d79d876174abcc21c34f00a32d9264e4e87e,The neuroscience of human empathy for pleasure: protocol for a scoping review,"Objective The neuroscience of human empathy for pleasure and positive affect is an emergent, scarcely addressed topic. The main aim of this scoping review is to map the impact of this new research domain on the field of social and affective neuroscience. Introduction Most of the literature on empathy and affect sharing has hitherto focused on negative emotions, with a special focus on pain. However, understanding, sharing, and reacting to others’ pleasures is an evolutionarily and socially important function. Our scoping review addresses this gap in the literature and tries to unify the available information under the empathy for pleasure umbrella. Inclusion criteria This scoping review is intended to cover studies on empathy for positive emotions, pleasant sensory outcomes, and other rewards in healthy individuals and neurological/neuropsychiatric/neurodevelopmental disorders populations. Methods We will perform a systematic search in the Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) databases. Two authors will independently screen all titles, abstracts, and then full-text articles that meet the inclusion criteria. The year range of interest will be 2000–2022, and only journal articles published in English will be assessed. Data will be extracted and presented in tables and/or graphical representations to synthesize and describe the results. The extracted data will be reported in a comprehensive summary. Results The final manuscript is intended for submission to an indexed journal in late 2023/beginning 2024. Conclusions To our knowledge, the present scoping review will be the first to address the variety and heterogeneity of available evidence on human empathy for pleasure. We ultimately aim at perusing the growing literature on this far-reaching field of study and informing future research.

6922820ba909af7718a6a4b1c0a6911d72d6fa45,"Euclid: Searching for pair-instability supernovae 
with the Deep Survey","Pair-instability supernovae are theorized supernovae that have not yet been observationally confirmed. They are predicted to exist in low-metallicity environments. Because overall metallicity becomes lower at higher redshifts, deep near-infrared transient surveys probing high-redshift supernovae are suitable to discover pair-instability supernovae. The Euclid satellite, which is planned to be launched in 2023, has a near-infrared wide-field instrument that is suitable for a high-redshift supernova survey. The Euclid Deep Survey is planned to make regular observations of three Euclid Deep Fields (40 deg2 in total) spanning the Euclid's 6 year primary mission period. While the observations of the Euclid Deep Fields are not frequent, we show that the predicted long duration of pair-instability supernovae would allow us to search for high-redshift pair-instability supernovae with the Euclid Deep Survey. Based on the current observational plan of the Euclid mission, we conduct survey simulations in order to estimate the expected numbers of pair-instability supernova discoveries. We find that up to several hundred pair-instability supernovae at z<~ 3.5 can be discovered within the Euclid Deep Survey. We also show that pair-instability supernova candidates can be efficiently identified by their duration and color that can be determined with the current Euclid Deep Survey plan. We conclude that the Euclid mission can lead to the first confirmation of pair-instability supernovae if their event rates are as high as those predicted by recent theoretical studies. We also update the expected numbers of superluminous supernova discoveries in the Euclid Deep Survey based on the latest observational plan.",Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics,2022.0,5,"{'url': 'https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2022/10/aa43810-22.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08727, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0702627184cfbba09635fb777c6ebbc4ce1a1cf7,Predictions of Alzheimer’s disease treatment and care costs in European countries,"Background Given the increasing lifespan of the elderly and the higher proportion of older people in the global population, the incidence rate of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing. The aim of this study is to evaluate, by means of computer simulations, developments in the costs of treating and caring for people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the EU 28 by 2080, while assuming the introduction of drug administrations at various disease stages. Methods Impact analysis leverages a mathematical model that compares five different population development scenarios when introducing different types of drugs to the scenarios but without changing the treatment. Changes in the economic burden are considered as of 2023, when new drugs are expected to enter the market. Findings The results of the simulations show that by prolonging the length of a person’s ‘stay’ in the Mild, Moderate, or Severe stage, the total cost of care for all persons with AD will increase by 2080. For individual scenarios, the percentage of patients and costs increased as follows: Mild by one year, by 10.61%; Mild by two years, by 17.73%; Moderate by one year, by 16.79%; Moderate by two years, by 34.88%; and Severe by one year, by 23.79%. The change in cost development when prolonging the stay in the Mild cognitive impairment stage (by lowering the incidence by 10%, 30%, or 50%) reduced the cost (by 4.88%, 16.78% and 32.48%, respectively). Interpretation The results unambiguously show that any intervention prolonging a patient’s stay in any stage will incur additional care costs and an increase in the number of persons with AD. Therefore, extending lifespan is important in terms of improving the quality of life of patients, and the introduction of new drugs must consider the additional costs imposed upon society.",PLoS ONE,2019.0,51,"{'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210958&type=printable', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6347248, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

should be based on the preparation of players of different game roles, where the
determining factor is the specificity of competitive activity of players in certain types of
team game sports. Formation of game playing roles is a necessary component, with the
help of which it becomes possible to clearly distribute the responsibilities of athletes
during the game, which makes it possible to turn competitive activity into a complex
organizationally controlled system.
The aim of the study is to determine the main trends in the training of players of different game
roles of team game sports according to the data of modern special scientific and
methodological literature.
Material and methods: theoretical analysis and generalization of literary sources and data in the
Internet, generalization, comparison and contrast.
Results. The analysis of publications in the international scientometric databases Scopus and Web
of Science in the period from 2019 to 2023 allowed us to establish that the majority of
scientific works concerning the system of training athletes in different types of team
game sports are presented in the direction of control of different aspects of fitness (33%)
and determination of the structure of competitive activity (23%). The largest number of
scientific works in the scientometric bases is presented in soccer and basketball 6%
respectively.
Conclusions. It is emphasized the necessity of taking into account individual capabilities of athletes
in team game sports when forming game roles, completing the starting line-up of the
team, searching for universal players, which will allow to carry out not only effective
management of competitive activity, but also to determine the trends that should be
taken into account when building a multi-year process of sports improvement.",Sport Science and Human Health,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'http://sporthealth.kubg.edu.ua/article/download/302808/294807', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.28925/2664-2069.2024.14?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.28925/2664-2069.2024.14, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

354f05f91dbee0382282d1a94a8e31565001a8de,Design and validation of the usability framework of learning management systems,"Purpose
This study aims to identify the most important factors affecting the usability of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and present these factors in the form of a comprehensive and practical framework and validate the framework.

Design/methodology/approach
In this research, a mixed research method and sequential exploratory research design were used. In the qualitative section, the qualitative meta-synthesis method was utilized to extract usability factors from the research literature and formulate the framework of factors, and in the quantitative section, the survey method was employed to validate the framework. In the qualitative section, the research field included the research available in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, and the data collection tool included electronic and printed documents on the usability factors of LMSs. To validate the findings, in addition to citing research literature and theoretical foundations, the audit trail, consensual validity and expert peer review methods were used. Also, to analyze the data, the thematic analysis method and thematic network via MAXQDA 2020 software were used. In the quantitative section, the statistical population was students of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences at Allameh Tabatabai University in Iran, and the sample included undergraduate students of this faculty with a volume of 200 people. The tool for collecting information was a researcher-made questionnaire that was provided to students in the first half of the academic year 2022–2023. To validate the findings, content-related validity through Content Validity Ratio (CVR) and Content Validity Index (CVI) and construct validity through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Convergent Validity were examined. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and Composite Reliability (CR) were also used to check reliability. To analyze the data one-sample T-test via SPSS 27 software was used, and the PLS-SEM was utilized via SmartPLS 4 software to validate the framework proposed by the researcher.

Findings
The findings from the qualitative part of this research include basic themes and organizing themes related to the global theme of usability. Based on the findings from the qualitative part, it can be concluded that the factors in terms of frequency in the research literature have the following ranks: interaction (first rank), ease of use and usefulness (second rank), learnability (third rank), navigation (fourth rank), satisfaction and enjoyment, visual design and accessibility (fifth rank), help and assessment and feedback (sixth rank) and content, errors correction and privacy and security (seventh rank). The findings of the quantitative part include the external fit indexes of the framework and the internal fit index of the framework; based on the obtained values, it can be concluded that the framework of LMS usability factors has a good fit.

Early advancements distinguished OAM from spin angular momentum (SAM), leading to practical innovations such as optical tweezers and quantum entanglement. Compared with SAM, OAM can carry more information, which makes it invaluable for high-capacity data transmission and secure communications. Professor Miles Padgett, a leading scientist in the field of optical momentum, is well-known for his contributions, including the realization of an optical spanner for spinning micron-sized objects, the use of orbital angular momentum to increase the data capacity for communication systems, and the development of an angular form of the Einstein‒Podolky‒Rosen (EPR) quantum paradox. In an enlightening conversation with Light: Science & Applications, he highlighted the fundamental properties of the angular momentum of light, the invention of optical tweezers and optical spanners, and the demonstration of OAM states for extending the alphabet of optical communication using both classical and quantum light. In particular, he explained the various aspects of OAM distinguished from SAM. This interview further explored his collaboration with industry partners that bridges the gap between academic research and real-world applications by using his skill in light shaping in various areas, including his current role as the principal investigator for QuantIC and his group’s work on building novel endoscopes that are the size of the width of a human hair. As an academic administrator, during his 5-year term as Vice-Principal for Research at the University of Glasgow (2014–2019), Professor Miles Padgett’s efforts led to an improvement in the quality of the University’s research publications from the lower quartile to the upper quartile in the Russell Group of the UKs leading universities. In this interview, he shared his approach to improve research culture to build up research collaboration, secure external funding for conducting cutting-edge research, and translate blue-sky research into real-world impact. In addition to his research success, Miles also serves many important roles for research societies and funding agencies. For example, as the Interim Executive Chair for EPSRC in 2023, his tenure successfully led to a nearly 50% increase in the number of funded Centres for Doctoral Training, corresponding to an additional intake of 1500 students. When asked about his motivation to serve on research committees, he expressed his ambition to shape the direction of science, advocating for areas of science with the potential to impact society. For young scientists, his advice is to understand that perseverance and adaptability are crucial for research career progress while remembering that luck also plays a role—sometime you just have to hang on in.",Light: Science & Applications,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11976937, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0f0f82860f85f30216aab6a3ab6fe739459be4b1,57 Implementation of an analytic resource navigation process at an Academic Medical Center,"Objectives/Goals: In 2018, a novel analytic resource navigation process was developed at Duke University to connect potential collaborators, leverage resources, and foster a community of quantitative researchers and scientists. We provide information about how this process works along with guidance for academic medical centers to develop similar initiatives. Methods/Study Population: Quantitative and qualitative scientists with expertise in data science, biostatistics, epidemiology, and related fields play a critical role in data collection, study design, analysis, interpretation, and implementation. The analytic resource navigation process connects researchers with quantitative scientists and relies on strong institutional knowledge of methodological expertise, understanding of research goals, educating researchers, and ongoing evaluation to understand unmet needs. University staff serve as navigators to help researchers identify the needed expertise, find potential collaborators, and track outcomes. Duke University’s tracking system for this navigation process, implemented in 2019, underwent a nearly five-year evaluation (November 2019 – September 2024). Results/Anticipated Results: In the nearly five-year evaluation of the process, 1247 requests from 813 unique researchers were navigated with a success rate of 93.8%. A total of 323 requests (256 unique researchers) were navigated in year 1, 285 requests (239 unique researchers) in year 2, 210 requests (179 unique researchers) in year 3, and 247 requests (192 unique researchers) in year 4. In the current year (partial year 5, 11/1/2023 – 9/18/2024), 182 requests have been navigated (159 unique researchers). Unsuccessful linkages occurred in 35 requests (2.8%) and 42 requests (3.4%) were withdrawn. Among the cases of unsuccessful navigation, 26 failed due to effort (e.g., insufficient effort available to meet the researcher’s deadline), 2 failed due to lack of expertise at the institution, and 4 failed due to a lack of sufficient funding.

In 2005, the Bologna Process was implemented in this field as well, with specialized education being organized in three specific cycles: undergraduate and master's studies, postgraduate studies and doctoral studies. Starting with this moment, we are assisting the attempt to standardise the curriculum, implicitly the set of skills and competences that graduates must have after graduation. This is supervised by the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Higher Education; the competences and skills are listed in the register drawn up by the National Agency for Qualifications, and they are correlated with the ESCO register (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations). By analysing the most recent RAQAHE recommendations (updated in 2022), the ESCO and NAQ registers, we aim to highlight the topicality of the study programmes offered by the four universities. The discussions can be held, in essence, on how prepared graduates are for the labour market and what would be the next steps for a more frequent adaptation of the content of subjects in curriculum in order to take into account the views formulated by The European Network Of Public Employment Services in June 2023, as a contribution to the European Year of Skills.

BZPs are divided into six general categories including coumarins, chromans, 2H-chromenes, 4H-chromenes, chromones, and 4-chromanones, each of which is abundant in many plants and foods. These oxygenated heterocyclic compounds are fascinating motifs and have extensive applications in biology and materials science. Hence, numerous efforts have been made to develop innovative approaches for their extraction and synthesis. However, most of them are step-by-step or multi-step strategies that suffer from waste material generation and a tedious extraction process. Isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions (I-MCRs) offer a highly efficient method for overcoming these problems. The I-MCR is a simple and environmentally friendly one-pot domino procedure that does not require intermediate isolation or workup and is generally more efficient in material usage. This review covers all research articles related to I-MCRs for synthesizing BZP derivatives from the beginning to the middle of the year 2023. This strategy will be useful for organic and pharmaceutical chemists to design new drugs and optimize the synthesis steps of biological compounds and commercial drugs with benzopyran cores.",Organic and biomolecular chemistry,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1039/d3ob01671d?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1039/d3ob01671d, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f9d0be3cbddd3d6a7b961185071aeaecacb69155,A Study on the Heat Wave Conditions over Bangladesh During 1990 - 2019,"When temperature exceed 36 degrees with a large area and linger for minimum three or more days can be considered as heat wave (HW). In the Pre-monsoon, the sun ray drops down on the ‘Thar’ desert (India) and the foothill of the Himalayas vertically, the area makes a hot-tempered zone. That is why, these regions produce a trough of low and there is a possibility to advect temperature towards Bangladesh. The south/south westerly wind carries a high amount of moisture over Bangladesh. The heat capacity of moisture is higher than that of dry air. Solar insulation, temperature advection and moisture incursion are three main phenomena that are responsible for HW condition. Veering is also responsible for especially severe and very severe HW conditions. The present study is accompanying with all category’s frequency of heat wave days (HWD) and HW for the Pre-monsoon (March to May) over most of the stations (34) of Bangladesh for the period 1990-2019. Microsoft excel, Surfer and Arc GIS software have been used for data calculation, however, linear trend analysis and Mann-Kendall test have been used to draw the trend of HW frequency. The highest numbers of HWD are found in Jashore (30.9 days) of all types of events whereas the highest frequencies of HW are found in Rajshahi (4.2333) during pre-monsoon season. The lowest numbers of frequency of HWD and HW, both are found at Chattogram. April is the hottest month in Bangladesh. On the basis of frequency of HWD, the obtained highest hot places are Jashore, Chuadanga, Rajshahi, Ishurdi and Satkhira. while in Kutubdia and Teknaf, no HW is found at all. Among 30 years, 2014 is found the hottest year and 2018 is the recorded lowest hot year. By Mann-Kendall test, the HW trend of M. Court, Mongla, Patuakhali and Chandpur have indicated positive significant value, and Mymensing station has given only negative significant value. From spatial distribution, it shows the hottest areas which are south western and middle-western parts of Bangladesh.

b4a945a282dee7fa97843dfb5a173cb99a2320f4,Epidemiology in sailing: A systematic literature review including suggestions for injury prevention,"Introduction & Purpose 
Sailing is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide and as varied as the disciplines in sailing are the injuries. According to the definition of Neville and Folland (2009, p. 141), sailing injuries can be defined as “any physical complaint sustained by a sailor that results from sailing or sailing-related activities”, whereby sailing-related illnesses have been excluded from this review. Most of the literature focuses separately either on elite sailing, recreational sailing, or offshore circumnavigations. This systematic literature review, in contrast, aimed to combine all these different types of sailing. The aim of this study was, thus, 1) to highlight the frequencies, types, locations, and causes of injuries in sailing, and 2) to summarize possible preventive measures. 
Methods 
Following the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search limited to research published from 01.01.2005 to 10.05.2024 was performed electronically in the databases PubMed and Cochrane Library using the keywords “sailing” AND “injuries”. Exclusion criteria were non-English language and literature reviews. The literature search resulted in a total of 132 publications, thereof 112 were excluded based on their title, which was either double, not related to the disciplines of sailing or the topic of injuries. The remaining 20 publications were screened based on their abstracts. In this second round of filtering, 10 publications were excluded as they were not related to the disciplines of sailing and the topic of injuries. Finally, 10 publications were included in the present review. The selected literature was screened for the five categories of injury frequencies, types, locations, causes, and preventive measures associated with sailing. 
Results 
Injury frequency including time loss injuries and fatalitiesIn general, sailing-related injury rates vary strongly from 0.59 to 16 per 1,000 hours of sailing (Feletti et al., 2021; Neville et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2016). Thereby, sailing was ranked among the safest sports in the Olympic Games 2008; moreover, in the Olympics 2012, 1.0% of sailors sustained an injury resulting in time loss (Ryan et al., 2016). No differences in the injury rate between sexes could be observed (Crunkhorn et al., 2022). The calculated fatality rate amounts to 1.19 deaths per million sailing days (Ryan et al., 2016). 
Injury types and locationsIn sailing, the most commonly injured body parts are the upper limbs (40% of all reported sailing injuries), followed by the spine, back, neck, and head (14-30%) and the lower limbs (10-27%) (Feletti et al., 2021; Ham & Jee, 2016; Hayes et al., 2023; Landsberg & Hunt, 2023; Nathanson et al., 2010; Neville et al., 2006). The most frequently reported injuries are mild injuries such as contusions (27-40%), lacerations (19%), and abrasions (11%), which can potentially occur on the hand, shoulder, arm, knee, foot, and ankle (Feletti et al., 2021; Forycka et al., 2023; Hayes et al., 2023) as well as muscle cramps/spasms (20%) and strains/sprains (13%; Tan et al., 2016). Also, sunburns are highly frequent with 16% of all surveyed cases (Nathanson et al., 2010). Moreover, in professional sailing, overuse injuries are accountable for 24-58% of all reported injuries and primarily affect joints and ligaments (Neville et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2016). Furthermore, severe injury types include fractures (25%), torn tendons/cartilage (16%), and brain concussion (14%; Nathanson et al., 2010). 
Injury risks and causesInjuries sustained during sailing can be attributed to extrinsic as well as intrinsic risk factors. Some of the most commonly identified extrinsic causes are related to environmental conditions, such as heavy weather and solar exposure (Hayes et al., 2023; Nathanson et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2016). Further, lack of protective equipment and material failure (Nathanson et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2016) as well as impacts with part of the boat, in particular the boom, (Forycka et al., 2023; Landsberg & Hunt, 2023; Tan et al., 2016) pose major causes of injuries. Hayes et al. (2023) found that smaller boat sizes are related to a higher rate of incidents. Intrinsic risk factors include sailors’ inattentiveness, lack of communication among crew members, inadequate physical fitness, sleep deprivation, and insufficient experience (Forycka et al., 2023; Ham & Jee, 2016; Nathanson et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2016). Nevertheless, a low level of sailing credentials was not found to increase the injury risk (Hayes et al., 2023). Additionally, different repetitive tasks contribute to overuse injuries (Neville et al., 2006). Moreover, alcohol consumption has been shown to play a role in 12.2% of sailing-related deaths (Ryan et al., 2016). Finally, the most common fatal incidents are due to collisions, grounding, and falling overboard (Ryan et al., 2016). Thereby, 81.6% of deaths can be linked to not wearing a life jacket (Ryan et al., 2016). 
Preventive measuresTo prevent injuries, (UV-)protective equipment, such as gloves, helmets, shoes, insulating cloths, hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen, should be used (Feletti et al., 2021; Nathanson et al., 2010). As the likelihood of accidents rises with shorter boat sizes, Hayes et al. (2023) recommended increasing the minimum boat length. Besides, ergonomic boat design needs to be applied (Nathanson et al., 2010). To prevent accidents, gaining confidence with the boat is paramount (Hayes et al., 2023). In addition, physical training needs to be included in the sailing routine at all levels (Feletti et al., 2021; Ham & Jee, 2016). Furthermore, sufficient sleep and distraction limitation should be ensured (Forycka et al., 2023). Feletti et al. (2021) suggested regularly changing the ropes to maintain a soft structure. Mandatory first aid training and equipment are further fundamental preventive measures (Forycka et al., 2023; Hayes et al., 2023; Landsberg & Hunt, 2023). Moreover, the prohibition of being intoxicated should be extended to passengers (Ryan et al., 2016). Finally, sailors should be convinced to wear life jackets, which can be facilitated by improving their comfort and aesthetics (Nathanson et al., 2010). Educational campaigns should foster these safety habits continuously (Nathanson et al., 2010). 
Discussion 
The results demonstrate a strongly varying injury rate of 0.59 to 16 per 1,000 hours of sailing (Feletti et al., 2021; Neville et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2016), which was found to be lower than in contact team sports, such as soccer, but similar to the incidence reported in non-contact sports, such as professional cricket (Neville et al., 2006). The calculated fatality rate of 1.19 deaths per million sailing days is comparable to the fatality rate in alpine skiing (Ryan et al., 2016). The presented risk factors lead to the suggestion of various preventive measures. Several of them, inter alia sun-protective behaviour, promotion of safety gear, coaching on proper sailing technique, physical training as well as first-aid education and equipment are deemed to be advantageous (Nathanson et al., 2010; Neville et al., 2006). However, it is questionable if other identified prevention steps, like increasing the boat size (Hayes et al., 2023) or frequently renewing the ropes (Feletti et al., 2021), automatically represent safety enhancements as the associated increase in boat weight and rope slipperiness could impair boat handling. 
Conclusion 
The present literature examination updates characteristics as well as possible risk factors for injuries in all sailing disciplines and summarizes related potential preventive measures. Further research should systematically assess the effectiveness of the different prevention options suggested. To increase safety within the sailing disciplines, the vigorous implementation of such preventive measures on the part of sailing federations seems to be of uttermost importance.

1421498c6c2c91dafa5cc9546fa022527d1dd53e,Micro-Characterization of Recycled Concrete Aggregate,"Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is generated by crushing and processing concrete waste from demolition and construction activities, thereby reducing the environmental burden associated with disposing of concrete debris. The use of RCA in concrete production helps to alleviate the depletion of natural resources, as it serves as a substitute for traditional coarse and fine aggregates. This study identifies the microstructural aspects of RCA concrete, employing advanced techniques like scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging with energydispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to analyze the microstructure and chemical composition of recycled concrete. The detailed microstructural analysis is anticipated to elucidate how the RCA content influences the interfacial transition zone, bond strength, and overall concrete performance. RCA exhibits a unique microstructure due to the presence of attached old mortar, which can influence the overall performance of RCA concrete. This study also explores the utilization of 100% RCA in preparing recycled concrete, comparing it with old and ordinary new concrete. The focus is on microstructural properties, hydration products, and the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ) between cement paste and aggregates. Samples were collected from a 47-year-old building, separating aggregates into different grades. Recycled coarse aggregates and recycled fine aggregates were obtained, and natural aggregates were collected. Concrete mixes for recycled and natural concrete were designed for a test strength of C30. Concrete cylinders were tested for compressive strength at 7, 28, and 90 days. Old concrete exhibited a dense microstructure with well-formed C-S-H gels, contributing to its superior strength. Recycled concrete, however, showed a wider and less dense ITZ, resulting in a more porous microstructure. EDS spectra confirmed C-S-H gel as the primary hydration product in all mixes, with the Ca/Si ratio varying, indicating complexity in hydrated product formation. The research highlights differences in microstructural and chemical characteristics among old concrete, ordinary new concrete, and recycled concrete. The wider ITZ and more porous microstructure in recycled concrete contribute to reduced strength. These findings provide insights into sustainable construction practices, promoting the use of recycled materials and addressing environmental challenges in the construction industry. As the construction industry continues to embrace sustainability, further research into the properties, performance, and best practices for incorporating RCA into concrete will play a pivotal role in advancing eco-friendly construction methodologies.

2aa031d1915254f13ca4851bfed7a6c5552053ef,"Insights from Fossil-Bound Nitrogen Isotopes in Diatoms, Foraminifera, and Corals.","Nitrogen is a major limiting element for biological productivity, and thus understanding past variations in N cycling is central to understanding past and future ocean biogeochemical cycling, global climate cycles, and biodiversity. Organic nitrogen encapsulated in fossil biominerals is generally protected from alteration, making it an important archive of the marine nitrogen cycle on seasonal to million-year timescales. The isotopic composition of fossil-bound nitrogen reflects variations in the large-scale nitrogen inventory, local sources and processing, and ecological and physiological traits of organisms. The ability to measure trace amounts of fossil-bound nitrogen has expanded with recent method developments. In this article, we review the foundations and ground truthing for three important fossil-bound proxy types: diatoms, foraminifera, and corals. We highlight their utility with examples of high-resolution evidence for anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen to the oceans, glacial-interglacial-scale assessments of nitrogen inventory change, and evidence for enhanced CO2 drawdown in the high-latitude ocean. Future directions include expanded method development, characterization of ecological and physiological variation, and exploration of extended timescales to push reconstructions further back in Earth's history.

5014a9e18eb012afd33e8da721d6e6243373db98,Addressing Global Biodiversity Challenges: Ensuring Long-Term Sustainability of Morphological Data Collection and Reuse through MorphoBank,"Phenotypic, especially morphological, data are highly useful in systematics, taxonomy, and phylogenetics. Despite the increased use of genetic information, phenotypic data are necessary when researching the fossil record and remain useful for living taxa by providing independent evidence for testing molecular clades. MorphoBank is a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) database providing open biodiversity data in the form of morphological characters (O’Leary and Kaufman 2011, O'Leary and Kaufman 2012), a similar concept to GenBank for open access sequence data. MorphoBank enables scientists to share morphological character data associated with their peer-reviewed publications in the form of phylogenetic matrices as Tree analysis using New Technology (TNT) or NEXUS files. 
 MorphoBank hosts 1,738 publicly accessible projects (each MorphoBank project is issued a unique identifier (ID) begining with the letter P followed by a number) with 173,559 images and 1,138 matrices as of July 2024. These data can be downloaded by the public, researchers, and students in the scientific community, where the data can be used for educational purposes or reused in additional phylogenetic analyses. MorphoBank encourages scientists to add content in numerous ways throughout the research process, including while actively working on a morphological matrix or in conjunction with a paper to be published that has a morphological matrix. For example, some large projects, such as P773, represents collaborative research that contains a matrix with 4,541 characters and over 12,000 annotated images. Researchers looking to replicate or utilize the data from this study, a task that would normally be extremely time and labor intensive, are able to quickly and easily download and work with the data in their own analyses.
 MorphoBank has a team of part-time curators and interns who also add content post-publication. Between 2018 and 2023, MorphoBank staff accounted for 25% of project creation and 41% of project publication. The MorphoBank community members created more projects but published fewer of them in the same time frame. The MorphoBank curation team strives to add the matrices to make the data FAIR. A majority of the data are associated with publications in journals that require a subscription; MorphoBank makes the matrix data available with its complete metadata without a financial access barrier. Data standards for morphological character matrices include scored taxa, full taxonomic names, and complete character names with character state descriptions. Since NEXUS files have varying standardization and syntax (Maddison et al. 1997, Vos et al. 2012), importing a matrix can lead to data errors, which MorphoBank does not accept due to its mission to provide complete and reproducible datasets. Hence, users often add incomplete data as file attachments. To help ensure full data is uploaded, MorphoBank has partnered with journals to ensure instructions to authors or emails to authors of accepted manuscripts make clear the need to upload data matrices to MorphoBank. 
 MorphoBank has been cited over 1,500 times, with increasing citations each year (Fig. 1). We examined the use and impact of MorphoBank data on systematic and phylogenetic research and found that most data are used in phylogenetic analyses, describing new species, and examining diversification of taxonomic groups, which span a wide-range organisms from vertebrates such as dinosaurs, reptiles, and mammals (including studies of human evolution) to plants, invertebrates, and micro-organisms.
 MorphoBank has developed and implemented an internship program for undergraduate biology students focused on training in phylogenetic data, curation, research writing, and conference presenting. Part of this intership program involves utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to increase efficiency by automating the process of extraction of character name and state data from published articles and integrating them into NEXUS files.
 Three additional activities help raise awareness and increase community contributions to MorphoBank:
 
 
 
 A partnership with the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) was established in Summer 2024 to train volunteer curators.
 
 
 MorphoBank workshops have been developed for in-person (i.e., 12th North American Paleontological Convention in Ann Arbor, Michigan) and virtual (i.e., 3rd Joint Congress on Evolutionary Biology supported by the Society of Systematic Biologists) conferences.
 
 
 Virtual workshops will be offered quarterly to educate the scientific community on ways to add their own phylogenetic data to MorphoBank.

This is achieved when all individuals, at all times, have physical and economicaccess to adequate, safe, and nutritious food to fulfill their intake needs and food choices for an active andhealthy life. As a result of COVID-19, global activity has witnessed an exceptional decline. The physicaldistance, school closures, trade restrictions, and country lockdowns for controlling the COVID-19 pandemichave led to escalated nutritional challenges globally. Food insecurity is defined as the persistent concern aboutaccess to sufficient and affordable food at all times. Food insecurity causes stress in people. This review aimedto evaluate the extent of disruption and break in the chain of continuity of food security as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review perused peculiar causes of food insecurity in the context of the COVID-19 pandemicalong with measures to counter them for the attainment of sufficient food security. This review articlemethodology was inclusive of the utilization of three search engines. These included PubMed, Google as well asGoogle Scholar. The keywords included food security, food chain, challenges as well as COVID-19, and healthoutcomes. Articles were included based on being published from the year 2008-2023. Out of 66 articles, 50were included (75%). The food availability having deteriorated due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected foodsecurity globally leading to various adverse health outcomes. Also, this has added to the burden of hunger andmalnutrition across the globe. A special focus on agriculture can aid in dealing with the shortage of food. TheCOVID-19 pandemic has culminated in tremendous detrimental repercussions on food security. Food chainimprovement and efficiency can be of pivotal importance in connection with the food security challengeshaving ensued following the COVID-19 pandemic.

2cc86b29f0d368d286a8ed2a371cbc3b4ca7ec2a,The Diary of the Sky as a methodological strategy to teach Astronomy in Elementary School,"The aim of this paper is to describe some activities undertaken at different phases of a broader research project named “The Northern and Southern Skies: Teaching astronomy in schools”. This project is a collaborative agreement between São Paulo State University (Bauru Campus, São Paulo, Brazil) and La Sapienza Università (Rome, Italy). The project aimed to bridge the gap between the academic production in the field of astronomy education and the classroom experiences of elementary school teachers and their students. The project finds justification in the fact that elementary school teachers, in general, face significant challenges when teaching astronomy elements to their students. In this article, we describe some steps of this project and the teaching resource named Diary of the Sky and its implementation, starting with the translation of the original Il Diario del Cielo, in its Italian version, to Brazilian Portuguese (O Diário do Céu). The aforementioned Brazilian university offered in-service specialization courses to several elementary school teachers in the last few years (2018–2023), enabling them to interact with the dairy and understand key aspects of its methodology. Before using them, the Brazilian version was adapted to suit geographic local coordinates in the southern hemisphere—an opportunity for teachers in training to incorporate astronomical concepts into their planning. Throughout the academic year, students filled out their diaries on a daily basis. The Science Education Graduation Program at UNESP, along with teachers and researchers, acknowledged the value of this strategy and shared the data collected to be used in teaching courses at the masters and doctoral levels. Current studies on this methodology have now showed that the Diary of the Sky is a powerful and efficient tool for working introductory astronomy concepts with elementary students and training their respective teachers.",International Journal of Innovation in Science and Mathematics Education,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.30722/ijisme.32.02.003', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30722/ijisme.32.02.003?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30722/ijisme.32.02.003, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c81caec71c8917343080d45da8392e813703f36e,Development of Academic Achievement in Systemic Anatomy Course Through Flipped Classroom Teaching,"Background and Aims: With the rapid development of modern information technology, the popularization of computers and networks not only changes the way of entertainment but also has a profound impact on the reform of teaching. With the diversification of knowledge acquisition methods, traditional teaching ideas and teaching methods have to face reform. The traditional infusing teaching method does not give play to the students' subjectivity, but also seriously blows the students' enthusiasm for learning. The flipped classroom teaching approach, on the contrary, pays more attention to the principal position of students, transforms the one-way transfer of knowledge in traditional teaching into a two-way interaction between teachers and students, to help students better understand and master knowledge, promotes the internalization of knowledge, and enhance students' learning initiative. The purposes of this study were; 1) To develop learning activities for the flipped classroom teaching approach in the Systemic anatomy course and 2) To compare academic achievement scores between pre-test and post-test using the flipped classroom teaching approach. And 3) To study the students’ satisfaction with the flipped classroom teaching approach in the Systemic anatomy course.
Methodology: The sample consisted of 40 first-year students of Luzhou Vocational College of Medical Devices. In the first semester of 2023. Obtained by cluster random sampling technique. Research tools are used in lesson plans, academic achievement tests, and satisfaction questionnaires. In data analysis including percentages, means, standard deviations, and paired t-tests.
Results: The results of the study were as follows; 1) The development of learning activities for the flipped classroom teaching approach in the Systemic anatomy course has an average suitability value for all plans equal to 4.31, which is at a high level. 2) Students who studied using flipped classroom teaching approach learning activities had higher academic achievement scores post-test than pre-test at a statistical significance of.05 and 3) Students who learned using the gamification teaching model had overall satisfaction at a high level.
Conclusion: The Systemic Anatomy course's flipped classroom teaching strategy greatly increased students' academic progress and garnered high marks from them, according to the study. The post-test results were much higher than the pre-test results, and the learning activities that were devised were highly appropriate.",International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://so07.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/IJSASR/article/download/4911/3670', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.60027/ijsasr.2024.4911?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.60027/ijsasr.2024.4911, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

370ab0a238e317242cf86723cab8b8e99383cbc3,Status of the high-intensity heavy-ion accelerator facility in China,"Nuclear physics has been aiming at understanding of the origin, structure, and property of strongly interacting matters, which constitute nearly all visible matter in the universe. Despite tremendous breakthroughs and achievements over the past century, there still exists overarching questions that animate nuclear physics today and incite constructing next-generation heavy-ion accelerator complexes worldwide. In order to promote the national development of heavy-ion science and technology, China government approved the high-intensity heavy-ion accelerator facility (HIAF) in 2015, proposed by the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. HIAF is composed of a superconducting ion linear accelerator, a high-energy synchrotron booster, a high-energy radioactive isotope beam line, an experimental storage ring, and a few experimental setups. By using HIAF characterized with unprecedented intense ion beams from hydrogen through uranium, we can produce a large variety of exotic nuclear matters not normally found on the Earth, including super-heavy nuclides, short-lived extremely neutron-rich and proton-rich nuclides, finite nuclear matters in the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram, exotic nuclides containing hyperons, meson-nucleus-bound systems, and highly charged ions. Therefore, HIAF will bring researchers to the forefront of promoting the most vigorous and fascinating fields in nuclear physics, such as to explore the limits to the existence of nuclides in terms of proton and neutron numbers, to discover exotic nuclear structure and properties and then to study the physics behind, to understand the origin of heavy elements in the cosmos, to depict the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter, etc. In addition, HIAF will provide an excellent platform to develop heavy-ion applications in life science, space science, and material science. The construction of HIAF started up in December of 2018 and takes 7 years. The civil engineering and infrastructure are being constructed on time schedule and will be completed in July, 2023. R&D on key accelerator techniques are going on successfully, and prototypes of core devices are fabricated in collaboration with home and abroad universities, institutes, and companies. Presently, we come to the stage of invitation for bids and volume production of various apparatuses. We plan to start facility installation in summer of 2023. As a scientific user facility opening to domestic and oversea researchers, HIAF user community plays key roles in defining research programs and raising requirements. We call upon expertise, aspirations, and resources of a host of collaborators. Collaborations, dedicated to specific research subjects, are established and will be established. These collaborations develop new experimental techniques and methods and take responsibility for design and building of measurement systems. We have completed the design of experimental setups. A new gas-filled recoil separator and a novel storage-ring-based isochronous mass spectrometer are already built, and other measurement systems are under construction. The facility commissioning is scheduled at the end in the year of 2025. After into operation of the 2.5 billion Chinese yuan HIAF, this world-class facility will ensure the nation’s continued competitiveness in heavy-ion physics and technology through provision of outstanding discovery potential. Based on HIAF, we aim at establishing a world’s leading laboratory for research and education in nuclear science, accelerator physics and technology, and applications of energetic heavy ions to meet societal needs. In this paper, progress and status of civil engineering and infrastructure construction of HIAF are introduced, R&D on critical accelerator techniques and prototypes of core devices as well as development of new experimental techniques and methods are presented, and design and construction of experimental setups and the associated physics research programs are briefly depicted.",AAPPS Bulletin,2022.0,54,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43673-022-00064-1.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s43673-022-00064-1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s43673-022-00064-1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

25cb74e103765f4f1d40bbdd8edda2e6ce2e6313,The OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission operations design,"OSIRIS-REx is an acronym that captures the scientific objectives: Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security□Regolith Explorer. OSIRIS-REx will thoroughly characterize near-Earth asteroid Bennu (previously known as 1019551999 RQ36). The OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission delivers its science using five instruments and radio science along with the Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM). All of the instruments and data analysis techniques have direct heritage from flown planetary missions. The OSIRIS-REx mission employs a methodical, phased approach to ensure success in meeting the mission's science requirements. OSIRIS-REx launches in September 2016, with a backup launch period occurring one year later. Sampling occurs in 2019. The departure burn from Bennu occurs in March 2021. On September 24, 2023, the Sample Return Capsule (SRC) lands at the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR). Stardust heritage procedures are followed to transport the SRC to Johnson Space Center, where the samples are removed and delivered to the OSIRIS-REx curation facility. After a six-month preliminary examination period the mission will produce a catalog of the returned sample, allowing the worldwide community to request samples for detailed analysis. Traveling to and returning samples from an asteroid that has not been explored before requires unique operations consideration. The Design Reference Mission (DRM) ties together spacecraft, instrument, and operation scenarios. Asteroid Touch-and-Go (TAG) has various options varying from ground only to fully automated (natural feature tracking). Spacecraft constraints such as thermodynamics and high gain antenna pointing impact the timeline. The mission is sensitive to navigation errors, so a late command update has been implemented. The project implemented lessons learned from other “small body” missions. The key lesson learned was “expect the unexpected” and implement planning tools early in the lifecycle.

7ef2ee552df3196cd52ef2226e29741e04c71fa6,Beyond the Ballot Box: A Conversation About Democracy and Policing in the United States,"Political scientist Hakeem Jefferson (Stanford University) facilitated a discussion about race, policing, and the state of American democracy with fellow political scientists Cathy J. Cohen (University of Chicago), Yanilda M. González (Harvard Kennedy School), Rebecca U. Thorpe (University of Washington), and Vesla M. Weaver (Johns Hopkins University) on May 26, 2021. The conversation occurred a year after George Perry Floyd Jr., a 46-year-old Black man, was murdered by a White police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Moving beyond common notions of democracy that focus primarily on voting and electoral participation, the panelists discussed how American policing and the criminal justice system, more broadly, redefine citizenship, redistribute power, and shape marginalized people's understanding of their place in society. Closing remarks addressed the potential for change in how criminal justice institutions treat marginalized people and how political scientists can more usefully contribute to efforts that strengthen democracy for all.

f60a743cad6265d0f69fa7cc0cd35d4fdc29787c,"Science, technology and innovation: a key driver for economic growth","In present times, science, technology, and innovation (STI) is indispensable for prosperity and welfare as a key instrument for sustainable, smart, and inclusive growth. The low levels of public R&D funds, industrial R&D, and demand for innovation alongside rising global competitive pressure on sectors with high exports in 2002 were overcome by the instigation of an STI impetus in Turkey. This presentation considers the major strategies that are determined and implemented in Turkey to make a leap forward in the field of STI. The launch of the conceptualization of Turkish Research Area (TARAL) in 2004 set into motion a mobilization with which the private and public sectors, together with NGOs, strategically focus and collaborate on R&D and innovation (RDI). As the first plan aimed to springboard the country towards the long-term expectations that are foreseen for the year 2023 based on Vision 2023, the National Science and Technology Policies Implementation Plan (BTP-UP) was established for the five year strategy timeframe of 2005-2010. BTP-UP (2005-2010) was instrumental in diversifying the policy mix that is being utilized by the TARAL actors for RDI capacity-building. Furthermore, programs for human resources for science and technology and science and society, in addition to defense and space research programs were put under the auspices of the Prime Minister.
 The harmonization of top-down and bottom-up approaches combined with high-level leadership during the development phase of the national strategies gave rise to a swift mobilization of financial resources for TARAL and paved the way for the realization of triggering mechanisms, which include Industrial R&D and innovation grants, R&D tax incentives, and R&D and innovation-based public supply. The swift STI impetus towards becoming an ever-more dynamic system towards TARAL objectives indicate that Turkey is taking fast-paced strides to reach the major targets of raising Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D to 2% of GDP and full-time equivalent R&D personnel to 150,000 by 2013.",Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,2010.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/1822090.1822091?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/1822090.1822091, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

77df61a91aa4ad63e157568817d8e9cfdb5f865e,Solving a Wicked Problem in Deep Time: Nuclear Waste Disposal,"If ever there was an unprecedented scientific and engineering undertaking, and one with obvious ethical dimensions, it is the safe disposal of long-lived radioactive wastes from nuclear power generation. Given the extremely long half-lives of the radionuclides in these wastes, repositories must be safe and secure for a time period that greatly exceeds recorded human history. While many nations have tried to address this problem, only Finland and Sweden have successfully sited deep geological repositories. In Deep Time Reckoning, cultural anthropologist Vincent Ialenti provides us with a detailed case study of one of these success stories, Finland, which has built a repository on Olkiluoto Island in the western part of the country. The Onkalo repository is expected to open in 2023. Ialenti spent over 2 years in Finland, observing workers at the spent nuclear fuel management firm Posiva Oy from 2012 to 2014. The author highlights Posiva’s attention to long-term thinking to provide inspiration and guidance worldwide. A promising young scholar, Ialenti has already published several provocative papers on nuclear wastes. This book is a culmination of his ethnographic fieldwork. However, it should attract a wide audience, from social sciences and humanities scholars to nuclear power experts, as well the educated public interested in long-term thinking and solving seemingly intractable problems. Ialenti’s monograph is pitched as a response to the twin crises of restoring and protecting ecology and the climate in the so-called Anthropocene, and the ‘deflation of expertise’. The Introduction sets the stage for examining the Finnish case through the eyes of the technocrats who developed Posiva’s Safety Case for a 10,000 to 1 million year time frame. Finland is correctly identified as a society with a high-level of public trust, which greatly helps its case for nuclear waste disposal.

Commercially produced videos are commonly used by medical students but are rarely integrated into curricula. Objective Our goal was to examine student engagement with medical education videos incorporated into a preclinical Cardiovascular Systems course. Methods Students who took the first-year 8-week Cardiovascular Systems course in 2019 and 2020 were included in the study. Videos from Osmosis were recommended to be watched before live sessions throughout the course. Video use was monitored through dashboards, and course credit was given for watching videos. All students were emailed electronic surveys after the final exam asking about the course’s blended learning experience and use of videos. Osmosis usage data for number of video views, multiple choice questions, and flashcards were extracted from Osmosis dashboards. Results Overall, 232/359 (64.6%) students completed surveys, with rates by class of 81/154 (52.6%) for MD Class of 2022, 39/50 (78%) for MD/MPH Class of 2022, and 112/155 (72.3%) for MD Class of 2023. Osmosis dashboard data were available for all 359 students. All students received the full credit offered for Osmosis engagement, and learning analytics demonstrated regular usage of videos and other digital platform features. Survey responses indicated that most students found Osmosis videos to be helpful for learning (204/232, 87.9%; P=.001) and preferred Osmosis videos to the traditional lecture format (134/232, 57.8%; P<.001). Conclusions Commercial medical education videos may enhance curriculum with low faculty effort and improve students’ learning experiences.

5c95336ce2de31aaf608bda6e9108c2ca25d3d2a,Towards the profiling of the atmospheric boundary layer at European scale—introducing the COST Action PROBE,"The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is the layer closest to the Earth’s surface within which most human activities take place. The vertical profile of atmospheric thermodynamic parameters in the ABL impact weather, air quality and climate. However, surface sensor networks and satellite observations do not provide sufficient information on the high temporal variability and strong vertical gradients that occur in the ABL. Thus, the ABL represents an important but rather under-sampled part of the atmosphere. This observational gap currently hampers progress in numerical weather prediction, air quality forecasting and climate assessment. Due to recent technological and methodological advances, ground-based remote sensing instruments are now able to provide high-quality profiles of ABL parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind, aerosol and cloud properties. However, even though state-of-the-art ABL profilers are deployed at numerous sites in Europe, efficient science and technology networking and coordination is still required to exploit this rich dataset effectively. The current lack of data and procedure harmonization often diminishes the potential societal benefits of the existing ABL profiling data. This paper introduces PROBE, a new initiative funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST), that aims to broaden the bridge between a wide range of user needs and the science and technology expertise residing in industry and academia, while strengthening and harmonizing methods and procedures to yield higher quality ABL observational data. Here, the challenges, objectives and implementation plan for PROBE are described, highlighting some preliminary results that will be further developed into operational applications during the 4-year duration (2019–2023) of this collaborative project.",Bulletin of Atmospheric Science and Technology,2020.0,42,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42865-020-00003-8.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s42865-020-00003-8?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s42865-020-00003-8, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

More than 400,000 cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) are diagnosed every year worldwide and this is rising. Much of the increase has been attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV-positive OPSCC patients are often younger and have significantly improved survival relative to HPV-negative patients. Traditional management of OPSCC has been with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, as this was shown to have similar survival to open surgery but with significantly lower morbidity. Techniques have evolved, however, with the development of computerised planning and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and of minimally invasive surgical techniques. Acute and late toxicities associated with chemoradiotherapy are a significant burden for OPSCC patients and with an ever-younger cohort, any strategies that could decrease treatment-associated morbidity should be investigated.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effects of de-intensified adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy in comparison to standard adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy in patients treated with minimally invasive transoral surgery (transoral robotic surgery or transoral laser microsurgery) for resectable HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.


SEARCH METHODS
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 26 April 2018.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx (as defined by the World Health Organization classification C09, C10). Cancers included were primary HPV-positive squamous cell tumours originating from the oropharyngeal mucosa. Tumours were classified as T1-4a with or without nodal spread and with no evidence of distant metastatic spread. The intervention was minimally invasive transoral surgery followed by de-intensified adjuvant therapy (either omission of chemotherapy or reduced-dose radiotherapy). The comparator was minimally invasive transoral surgery followed by standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy or standard-dose radiotherapy. The treatments received were of curative intent and patients had not undergone any prior intervention, other than diagnostic biopsy.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (disease-related survival was to be studied where possible) and disease-free survival, measured at one, two, three and five years. Our secondary outcomes included assessment of swallowing ability and voice, measured at one, six, 12 and 24 months. We planned to use GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.


MAIN RESULTS
We did not identify any completed RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. However, three eligible studies are in progress:ADEPT is a phase III trial comparing postoperative radiotherapy with or without cisplatin in HPV-positive T1-4a OPSCC patients. Included patients must have received minimally invasive surgery and demonstrated extra-capsular spread from disease in the neck.ECOG-E3311 is a phase II trial of treatment for HPV-positive locally advanced OPSCC (stages III-IVa + IVb without distant metastasis). Patients are stratified after minimally invasive surgery. Medium-risk patients are randomised to either standard or reduced-dose radiotherapy.PATHOS is a phase III trial of treatment for HPV-positive OPSCC (T1-3, N0-2b). Patients are stratified after minimally invasive surgery. Medium-risk patients are randomised to either standard or reduced-dose radiotherapy. High-risk patients are randomised to radiotherapy with or without concurrent cisplatin.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
This review highlights the current lack of high-quality randomised controlled trials studying treatment de-escalation after minimally invasive surgery in patients with HPV-positive OPSCC. However, trials that will meet the inclusion criteria for this review are in progress with results expected between 2021 and 2023.",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2018.0,42,"{'url': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6517188?pdf=render', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/14651858.CD012939.pub2?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012939.pub2, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d57035bb0ea6262f7d7f396c39ab6e03d03b745c,Future Highest Energy Circular Colliders,"At present the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) pushes the energy frontier of accelerator-based particle physics. During its Run 1 (2010–2012) the LHC produced proton-proton collisions at centreof-mass energies of 7–8 TeV. For Run 2, in 2015, this energy will be increased to 13 TeV. The exploitation of the LHC will continue until about 2035. In particular, around the year 2023 the LHC will be upgraded for ten times higher integrated luminosity (“High Luminosity LHC,” or, short, HL-LHC), by means of a novel magnet technology based on Nb3Sn superconductor, paving the way for future projects. Indeed, in response to the 2013 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics, a design study for a future circular 100-TeV hadron collider (FCC-hh) has already been launched. This 100-TeV collider will exploit, and further advance, the HL-LHC magnet technology. In addition, the FCC-hh will require a new 100-km tunnel infrastructure in the Lake Geneva basin. As a potential intermediate step the same tunnel could host a high-luminosity circular e+e− collider (FCC-ee), serving as Higgs, Z, tt, and W factory. A lepton-hadron collider option (FCC-he) is also being considered. Similar projects of large circular lepton and hadron colliders, called CEPC and SPPC, are being pursued in China. The global FCC collaboration is evolving and expanding. Key parts of the hadron collider design study are now being co-funded by the European Commission in the frame of its HORIZON 2020 programme.

90605a60134e4123d283d6a147b030c0a8613179,Moving NIEHS Forward for the Next Five Years,"This month, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is happy to announce its new Strategic Plan. NIEHS Strategic Plan 2018–2023: Advancing Environmental Health Science, Improving Health (https://www.niehs.nih.gov/ about/strategicplan/index.cfm) succeeds the 2012–2017 plan (NIEHS 2012), continuing to move the institute in the direction of cutting-edge, innovative environmental health science while maintaining continuity of important research and translational priorities. The new Strategic Plan features a streamlined organization of three major themes. 1. “Theme I: Advancing Environmental Health Science” is the collection of NIEHS’s scientific research mission priorities. The goals articulated in this theme reflect many of the priorities in the 2012–2017 plan, but they have been updated to show where the science has moved forward. For example, whereas defining the concept of the exposome was a subgoal in the previous plan, the Exposome goal in the new plan emphasizes advancement of exposure science, development of new technologies, and integration of exposure science and the exposome into the wider universe of environmental health research, given the advances in this research area since 2012. Data Science and Big Data, which were part of a separate knowledge management goal in the 2012–2017 plan, have expanded and become a new goal under Theme I. Predictive Toxicology is another new goal in recognition of its status as a growing priority area within NIEHS and NTP. 2. “Theme II: Promoting Translation—Data to Knowledge to Action” brings all of NIEHS’s translational and public health priorities together in one group. Many of these priorities (e.g., Emerging Environmental Health Issues; Environmental Health Disparities; Outreach, Communication, and Engagement) existed as separate goals or subgoals in the 2012–2017 plan; however, collecting them together as an overarching theme gives greater importance and salience to NIEHS’s commitment to making a difference in public health. Other goals in this theme reflect ongoing activities. For example, the goal on Evidence-Based Prevention and Intervention combines both a commitment to support research to develop these strategies and the associated commitment to promote the results of this research to the networks of people who can effect translation into risk reduction interventions on the ground. This goal is intimately integrated with the Partnerships for Action goal, which restates the need for relationships between NIEHS and a wide variety of partner organizations who can provide key input to set research priorities, help create better studies, and ensure effective dissemination of information and actions wherever they are needed to prevent harm and promote health. 3. “Theme III: Enhancing EHS through Stewardship and Support” covers investments and policies that are needed to build and maintain the research and translation enterprises described in Themes I and II. The goals in Theme III also reflect their counterparts in the strategic plan published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH 2015), specifically Objective 3: Enhance Scientific Stewardship. Research training, both domestic and global, and promotion of workforce diversity in the environmental health sciences are two of the most fundamental aspects of this theme. A notable component of Theme III is the goal on Impact Evaluation. The 2012–2017 plan included a nascent goal articulating the need to understand the economic impact of policies and other actions to reduce environmental exposures and prevent disease and disability. The new Impact Evaluation goal in Theme III of the 2018–2023 plan expands the outcomes of interest beyond economic impacts to social and health impacts as well. Over a 16-month period starting in May 2017, NIEHS conducted a multistep planning process to identify both continuing priorities and new directions for the institute and the field of environmental health sciences for the next five years (Birnbaum 2017). The initial step was to gather input via an online tool, called the Trends & Insights Survey, which opened in June 2017 for a 60-d comment period. The tool offered the interested public an opportunity to provide general comments on overall needs and priorities in environmental health sciences for the next five years, as well as feedback on the goals of the 2012– 2017 NIEHS Strategic Plan and their relevance for future institute plans and priorities. The Trends & Insights Survey engaged 219 respondents; over 400 separate comments were submitted. Comments covered the full range of NIEHS scientific mission, activities, and priorities. A report on the survey comments and an initial analysis was presented to the National Advisory Environmental Health Sciences Council (NAEHSC) at their fall 2017 meeting (NIEHS 2017). With the analysis of these comments in hand, NIEHS staff and leadership began review of the issues raised in the online survey, changes in the state of the science since the publication of the 2012–2017 plan, and other considerations that would affect either the content or the organization of the successor plan. One such consideration was the publication in 2015 of the strategic plan for the full NIH (NIH 2015). This strategic plan was developed and published in response to a Congressional mandate [included in the 21st Century Cures Act: H.R. 34 Title II, Subtitle D, Section 2031 (U.S. Congress 2016)]. Individual institute plans are meant to align with the overall NIH strategic plan. A first draft NIEHS plan was finalized in early February 2018, posted on the NIEHS website for comment, and presented to the NAEHSC. Comments were collected until the end of March. They were reviewed and considered, and changes to the draft were proposed, debated, and ultimately adopted. Final text of the plan was completed by the end of May and presented to the NAEHSC. NIEHS has “lived” its 2012–2017 Strategic Plan, using it to drive decisions on funding announcements, workshops, symposia, intramural faculty hires, resource development, and communication strategies. The institute’s staff and leaders remain committed to extending and enriching the field of environmental health sciences over the next 5-year period, guided by the new Strategic Plan and by the vision of the NIEHS—to provide global",Environmental Health Perspectives,2018.0,2,"{'url': 'https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/pdf/10.1289/EHP4356', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'public-domain', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6375384, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

823f269edfb73f75d2416b0a86e81b9b21edd59d,The ETNA mission concept: Assessing the habitability of an active ocean world,"Enceladus is an icy world with potentially habitable conditions, as suggested by the coincident presence of a subsurface ocean, an active energy source due to water-rock interactions, and the basic chemical ingredients necessary for terrestrial life. Among all ocean worlds in our Solar System, Enceladus is the only active body that provides direct access to its ocean through the ongoing expulsion of subsurface material from erupting plumes. Here we present the Enceladus Touchdown aNalyzing Astrobiology (ETNA) mission, a concept designed during the 2019 Caltech Space Challenge. ETNA’s goals are to determine whether Enceladus provides habitable conditions and what (pre-) biotic signatures characterize Enceladus. ETNA would sample and analyze expelled plume materials at the South Polar Terrain (SPT) during plume fly-throughs and landed operations. An orbiter includes an ultraviolet imaging spectrometer, an optical camera, and radio science and a landed laboratory includes an ion microscope and mass spectrometer suite, temperature sensors, and an optical camera, plus three seismic geophones deployed during landing. The nominal mission timeline is 2 years in the Saturnian system and ∼1 year in Enceladus orbit with landed operations. The detailed exploration of Enceladus’ plumes and SPT would achieve broad and transformational Solar System science related to the building of habitable worlds and the presence of life elsewhere. The nature of such a mission is particularly timely and relevant given the recently released Origins, Worlds, and Life: A Decadal Strategy for Planetary Science and Astrobiology 2023–2032, which includes a priority recommendation for the dedicated exploration of Enceladus and its habitable potential.",Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences,2022.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2022.1028357/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/fspas.2022.1028357?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/fspas.2022.1028357, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2cad6a4b9fa120507b0de093b9fc1cd8a827cd44,Looking back on my journey as the editor-in-chief of Animal Bioscience,"Animal Bioscience (AB) is an international journal first published in 1988 under the title AsianAustralasian Journal of Animal Sciences (AJAS) by the Asian-Australasian Association of Animal Production Societies (AAAP). Since then, it has continued its publication journey. The current journal title was adopted in 2021. I was invited to become the Editor-in-Chief (EIC) of AJAS in 2001, which has been my second job since then and my sole volunteer activity after retirement from Seoul National University in 2013. According to a previous report [1], the idea of an official international journal publication was not well accepted initially by the AAAP member countries, perceiving no real need for such a journal and the absence of a firm belief in the success of such publication activities in Asia. However, a few dedicated frontier scientists led by Professor. In K. Han, the first EIC, turned AJAS into one of the most respected global journals in the animal science category. As expected, collecting the manuscripts during the early days was challenging. The journal received less than 50 manuscripts in the first year. However, the annual count rose to almost 1,000 in a few years. Presently, authors from more than 50 countries have chosen AB to report their research work. China and Korea are the major contributing countries, similar to the case with many other international journals. Approximately 70% of submissions are from the AAAP member countries, with the remaining 30% from the non-AAAP region. The journal has made a tremendous improvement in citation frequency. When first indexed by the SCIE in 1997, the impact factor (IF) of AJAS was below 0.1, which increased to 2.7 in 2021. The total number of citations in the first year was less than 100, increasing to almost 9,000 in 2021, an approximately 100-fold increase over the past 25 years [2]. Since AB began to publish articles with a new title in 2021 and IF is calculated based on citations in the last 2 years, the first IF of AB will be released sometime in June 2023. The IF of AB will likely be lower than that of AJAS in the next few years due to the shorter exposure time of AB. However, it will not influence the combined journal IF significantly.",Science Editing,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.escienceediting.org/upload/kcse-289.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.6087/kcse.289?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.6087/kcse.289, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d02173cd3ba113702448bf029505d6ead51f68aa,The Secret Sauce: Examining Law Schools that Overperform on the Bar Exam,"Since 2010, law schools have faced declining enrollment and entering classes with lower predictors of success despite recent signs of improvement. At least partly as a result, rates at which law school graduates pass the bar exam have declined and remain at historic lows. Yet, during this time, many schools have improved their graduates’ chances of success on the bar exam, and some schools have dramatically outperformed their predicted bar exam passage rates. This Article examines which schools do so and why. Research for this Article began by accounting for law schools’ incoming class credentials to predict an expected bar exam passage rate for each ABA-accredited law school. This Article then examines each law school’s aggregated performance on bar exams for which its graduates sat based on relative and absolute performance, weighing the difficulty of each state’s bar exam. Through this analysis, this Article identifies law schools with consistently higher and lower first-time bar exam passage rates over a period of six years between 2014 and 2019. In addition to identifying law schools that overperform on the bar exam, this Article is a novel contribution not only to the legal education literature but also to the quantitative methodological literature, given its unique tailoring of the classic value-added modeling design to the realities of the bar exam. In the second phase of research for this Article, the authors surveyed administrators at these overperforming and underperforming law schools, as well as law schools in the middle of the distribution, to qualitatively assess how these law schools approach the bar success of their students. Collectively, this Article provides significant insight into how law schools are responding to recent negative trends in bar passage rates, validates successful approaches to mitigate these negative trends, and * CJ Ryan is an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law and an Affiliated Scholar with the American Bar Foundation.

In 2021, law school enrollments saw increases for the first time since 2010; however, as of late, enrollment rates have remained fairly stable. Id. For example, in 2020, enrollment rates stayed at 2019 levels. See Karen Sloan, Most Law Schools Brought in Larger 1L Classes. Will the Class of 2024 Find Jobs?, REUTERS (Sept. 17, 2021, 3:40 PM), https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/most-law-schools-brought-larger-1l-classeswill-class-2024-find-jobs-2021-09-17/ [https://perma.cc/3ULE-H8W5]; ABA Reports Law 2023] THE SECRET SAUCE 67 schools can demonstrate their value is through the success of their graduates on the bar exam. Although passing the bar exam is certainly not the singular reason that a prospective law student seeks to attend law school, success on the bar exam is an important factor—at varying degrees, dependent on the student—in the calculus for why many current students are attending law school.2 After all, without a Juris Doctor School Enrollment for 2020 Remains Stable, AM.

Yet, bar passage rates are at or near all-time lows in many jurisdictions.

Many law schools have placed blame on the difficulty of the bar exam, especially in states like California. See Stephanie Francis Ward, Lowest Bar Pass Rate for California in 67 Years; Other States See Drop, Too, ABA J.

Other studies and licensing authorities have placed blame on worsening student credentials. See William Vogeler, Study Blames Law Students Not Law Schools for Low Bar Pass Rates, FINDLAW (Apr. 22, 2019, 12:01 PM), https://blogs.findlaw.com/greedy_associates/2019/04/study-blames-law-students--not-law-schools---for-low-bar-pass-rates.html [https://perma.cc/B7C3-6NSA] (citing a study by the ABA noting that law student credentials have declined nationally over the last few years). And many law schools have considered a variety of curricular changes, only occasionally with empirical support. See Louis N. Schulze, The Science of Learning Law: Academic Support Measures at Florida International University College of Law, 88 BAR EXAM’R, Summer 2019, at 2, 9, 11; Mario W. Mainero, We Should Not Rely on Commercial Bar Reviews to Do Our Job: Why Labor-Intensive Comprehensive Bar Examination Preparation Can and Should Be a Part of the Law School Mission, 19 CHAPMAN L. REV. 545, 554–55, 596 (2016). 2. Of course, the decision by a student to attend law school is multifactorial. There is a robust literature on student choice in the undergraduate context of the higher education sector. See generally, e.g., Robert K. Toutkoushian, Do Parental Income and Educational Attainment Affect the Initial Choices of New Hampshire’s College-Bound Students?, 20 ECON. EDUC. REV. 245 (2001); Laura Walter Perna, Differences in the Decision to Attend College among African Americans, Hispanics, and Whites, 71 J. HIGHER EDUC. 117 (2000); Stephen L. DesJardins et al., Modeling the College Application Decision Process in a Land-Grant University, 18 ECON. EDUC. REV. 117 (1999); James C. Hearn, Determinants of Postsecondary Education Attendance: Some Implications of Alternative Specifications of Enrollment, 10 EDUC. EVALUATION & POL’Y ANALYSIS 171 (1988). Yet, there is little scholarly attention to student choice in the graduate education context and legal education in particular. Two recent and contemporaneous studies shed light on the factors that prospective students considered in deciding whether to attend law school and the factors that influenced their decisions. In both studies, bar exam success was a factor in most students’ decision to attend law school. However, the extent to which the bar passage rate of a given law school was an important factor in a student’s decision to attend law school varied with the student’s credentials on entry.

519f62597b3b39c007eec8e269f56d3adc8cead2,Using Drugs to Keep Learning Active During a Pandemic,"The rapid switch to delivering material via web-conferencing modalities such as Zoom© has been an adjustment for both students and faculty, particularly for schools with a heavy active-learning-based curriculum. At the Dell Medical School (DMS), we employ a flipped-classroom approach to deliver the first-year basic sciences [1, 2]. In our flippedclassroom sessions at DMS, students view videos, listen to podcasts, or engage with tailored pre-reading prior to coming to the class where they work in small group activities (approximately 5 students per group). Maintaining small group active learning during the COVID-19 pandemic using distance learning is a challenge fraught with barriers [3]. One promising strategy that I used to deliver active, flipped-classroom pharmacology sessions entails using the breakout room feature of Zoom©. This simple act of splitting students up into smaller groups appears to come close to approximating small group interaction typically leveraged in the classroom. For example, Zoom© breakout rooms were used in tandem with a flipped-classroom activity to cover the clinical pharmacology of drugs for diabetes, including clinically relevant adverse effects and pharmacokinetics. In this session, students were provided a blank table with missing variables and information on the common and serious adverse effects, lipid changes, ability to cause weight gain or weight loss, and route of administration for representative agents from each of the major classes of drugs used to treat diabetes (Fig. 1). Prior to the session, students were asked to watch a brief video on the pharmacology of the drugs for diabetes with a focus on the adverse effects and pharmacokinetics (mechanism of action, while revisited in the video, was covered in the first half of the year). The following day, a set of instructions and the table were provided “just-in-time” at the start of the 30-min-long session. Briefly, students were randomly assigned to one of eight groups (corresponding to a single diabetes drug row on the table in Fig. 1). The students were instructed to work together for 15 min to assemble the information to populate the table for their groups’ drug and select a “spokesperson”who would present their findings to the overall class upon reconvening. Students were encouraged to “recall” the information they learned from the pre-class video. Thus, there are loose, but deliberately incorporated, elements of both peer-instruction and retrieval practice built into the exercise [4]. As the students worked in their groups, I moved back and forth among the groups as an observer. Following small group discussions in the breakout rooms, students were brought back to the main room where their spokesperson reported out their findings. The correct answers were then sequentially revealed to the class following each groups’ online presentation. A total of 40 students (out of 50 students) in our M1 class of 2023 were in attendance for this session. Therefore, despite organizing and deploying this emergency remote teaching session at a moment’s notice at the beginning of the pandemic lockdown, it came close to replicating the flipped-classroom environment we typically use in-person with similar numbers of students and levels of engagement. Pedagogically, one of the goals of this session is for students to “retrieve” information they learned the night before from the video for discussion with their group, thereby strengthening their memory retention of the information. Additionally, inclusion of a column on “lipid changes” induced by the different agents, which can vary depending on the source or reference you consult, proved to be a key * Michael W.

Shrill, doomsday proposals from IAT experts involve rationing the precious pool of remaining IAT novices or other naive strategies. These solutions demonstrate rigid, scientific thinking, with a distinct lack of the creative flair that makes psychology stand apart from the real sciences. Building on our prior experience of adapting the IAT for measuring infant cognition and rooting out aliens among us, we demonstrate that new pools of participant resourcesmdash;the unborn and passed on—are available, if we take the time to develop the methods to exploit them.

However, this is a challenging feat since nanofabrication education uses hands-on cleanroom facilities. Since cleanrooms are expensive, have access constraints due to safety concerns, and offer limited instructional space, class sizes and outreach events are limited. To complement instruction in nanotechnology education, there is some open-or educational-access software, which is computer-based and focuses only on training for individual equipment, not on the typical workflow for device fabrication. The objective of this work was to develop an accessible virtual reality ecosystem that provides an immersive education and outreach on device nanofabrication that is user-friendly for a broad range of audiences. At the George Washington University (GWU), a virtual reality cleanroom prototype has been developed. It consists of a 45-minute gameplay module that covers the process flow for the fabrication of micro-scale resistors, from sample preparation to electrical characterization. We also performed a mixed methods study to investigate how 5 students in a nanoelectronics course utilized this virtual reality cleanroom prototype and what changes they recommend to improve its user interface and learner experience. The study population for this work-in-progress consisted of students enrolled in a nanoelectronics course at GWU during the 2022-2023 school year. Students taking this course can be undergraduate (junior or senior) or graduate (masters or PhD). The research questions for this study were 1) what is the user experience with the virtual reality cleanroom prototype, 2) what challenges, if any, did students experience, and 3) what changes did students recommend to improve the virtual reality cleanroom prototype learner experience? Preliminary results indicate that the students found the virtual reality cleanroom simulator helpful in repeatedly exploring the cleanroom space and the nanofabrication process flow in a safe way, thus developing more confidence in utilizing the actual cleanroom facility. The results of this study will provide insight on the design of future modules with more complicated levels and device process flows. Moreover, the study could inform the development of other virtual reality simulators",2023 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,,1,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/44588.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--44588?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--44588, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

23ba0933dc4f1e9cbb97467985112f1585a3fefd,Health technology in perspective,"The ongoing development of information and communication technology (ICT) is taking the healthcare industry to the next level. It allows an independent healthcare system by which anyone can easily obtain tne real-time measurement of individual biometrics as well as customized prescriptions without the hassle to visit health professionals in person. 
 
Google, a corporate giant of the ICT industry, has been cooperating with a leading pharmaceutical company, Novartis, on the Smart Lens, which gives LED alerts when the measured serum glucose level acquired from tear drops is excessive. This product will enable diabetic patients to reduce the inconvenience of countless blood samplings. The ingestible sensor is currently limited to integration with inactive pharmaceuticals taken alongside medication, but in the near future, the function of the ingestible sensor will be widened in range by integration with active pills for targeted areas of the body. Silicon Valley-based Proteus Digital Health has conducted clinical trials in this therapeutic area. 
 
Experts predict that 80% of medical data in hospitals will soon be obtained using wearable devices. Lux Research, an independent research and advisory firm, also anticipates the size of the digital healthcare industry will rise more than eightfold from $5.1 billion in 2013 to $41.8 billion by 2023. 
 
ICT has transformed the existing concept of hospital-centered healthcare to individualcentered care. This trend is evidenced by the international conference Health 2.0. In 2007, a few medical and ICT industry bloggers launched this conference, which now has become a prestigious international event where professionals from global ICT corporations as well as insurance and health companies attend. 
 
This year's Health 2.0 Conference will be held in Seoul on April 14-15, sponsored by the South Korean government, with a theme of health and wellness ICT. Considering the ultimate goal of dentistry, we should take a close look at the agenda of this upcoming event. It includes 'The happiness of the ICT platform', 'Developing a senior's health and wellness index', and 'Four dimensions of health & wellness ICT services with innovative technology', which are all essential issues in dentistry. 
 
We must continue to integrate ICT with dental science, following the latest trends in ICT for health care.",Journal of Periodontal & Implant Science,2015.0,1,"{'url': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4341201?pdf=render', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4341201, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ba126f0bdb3fd28232509d7a4f306337d827318a,Future Impacts of Distributed Power Generation on Ambient Ozone and Particulate Matter Concentrations in the San Joaquin Valley of California,"ABSTRACT Distributed power generation—electricity generation that is produced by many small stationary power generators distributed throughout an urban air basin—has the potential to supply a significant portion of electricity in future years. As a result, distributed generation may lead to increased pollutant emissions within an urban air basin, which could adversely affect air quality. However, the use of combined heating and power with distributed generation may reduce the energy consumption for space heating and air conditioning, resulting in a net decrease of pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. This work used a systematic approach based on land-use geographical information system data to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of distributed generation emissions in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin of California and simulated the potential air quality impacts using state-of-the-art three-dimensional computer models. The evaluation of the potential market penetration of distributed generation focuses on the year 2023. In general, the air quality impacts of distributed generation were found to be small due to the restrictive 2007 California Air Resources Board air emission standards applied to all distributed generation units and due to the use of combined heating and power. Results suggest that if distributed generation units were allowed to emit at the current Best Available Control Technology standards (which are less restrictive than the 2007 California Air Resources Board standards), air quality impacts of distributed generation could compromise compliance with the federal 8-hr average ozone standard in the region. IMPLICATIONS The San Joaquin Valley is a fast growing region that demands increasing power generation to sustain the economic development, and at the same time it is one of the worst polluted areas in the United States. Hence, the region demands alternatives that minimize the air quality impacts of power generation. This paper addresses the air quality impacts of distributed generation of power, an alternative to central power generation that can potentially reduce greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions throughout the United States.",Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association,2011.0,5,"{'url': 'https://escholarship.org/content/qt73w637np/qt73w637np.pdf?t=odlx3w', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/10473289.2011.603990?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/10473289.2011.603990, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Each week, we select a Silicon Valley resident at random from the local teleview directory. Then, we use our fabulous LIFER intelligent agent progranl to collect all sorts of scandalous data about the individual that was chosen. Then, L1FER composes an embatxassing biography of that person using the data that was collected. It's allmeant to be taken in the spirit of good, clean fun. Of course, LIFER only collects information that can be attained legally over the Global Landscape. LIFER is fully compliant with rite GL-FIA, the Global Landscape Freedom of Information Act of 2013, that is designed to protect personal privacy. LIFER uses a powerful inference engine to extract information from data that appears to be anonymous. None of the provisions of the GL-FIA prevent this kind of massaging of anonymous data. If anything, LIFER shows that the GL-FIA should either be modified, imposing greater restrictions on the massaging of anonymous data, or repealed entirely, as being unenforceable in this age of global computer networks and communications. This week's subject is RandolfRedding who ct~entiy resides at 2345 Westinghouse Street in West Silicon Valley. Here is the biography that our LIFER progranl spun out on this fascinating human subjecL one of 700,000 fascinating human subjects in the greater Silicon Valley area. So, this is your life... RandolfRedding! Randoif, you were born on May 14, 2001 to Ben and Martha Redding at Silicon Valley hospital. Happy birthday! As you doubtless know, you are going to receive a free one year subscription to the Silicon Valley Sentinel-Observer just because you were chosen for This is Your Life. You attended Grover Cleveland Elementary School where you had to be called to the principal's office in the fifth grade because you set fire to a roll of toilet paper in the boy's room. Naughty you! You also put a dead mouse in poor Betty Natale's book bag and that got you snspended fi:om school for a while. At John F. Kennedy Middle School you were caught smoking in the boy's room and were suspended from school for an entire week, At Bjarne Stroustroup High School you straightened out a bit and maintained a Caverage. Of course, in your job application to ComputerCosmos (see below) you claimed that you had a B average in high school. Naughty, Naughty. You scored at the 38th percentile in mathematics and at the 29th percentile in verbal skills on your SATs. You gave up on the idea of becoming a brain surgeon (good thlnking!) and decided to join the ranks of the working man. You graduated from Stroustroup High in 2018 and went on to work as a salesperson at the ComputerCosmos computer emporium in Silicon Heights. It was shortly after graduation that you moved to the swinging single's apartment complex at 1213 Meandering Road in Silicon Heights. It was there that you received your first charge card, VISA card # 1245938431223, which has since expired. It would not be legal for us to reveal your present Master Card card number., but your present balance is $1,234.54 which ineludes a $231.45 interest charge. You bought many interesting tlfings with your original VISA card, but on the positive side you had a love for culture, being an avid reader of Henry Miller. You made repeated visits to Le Sex Shoppe where you purchased all sorts of interesting clothing items, hopefully for your girlfriends. It was at about this time that you opened an account on one of the Global Landscape movie services. During the first week of your subscription you viewed all of the ""Debbie Does"" movies, including ""Debbie Does Dallas"", ""Debbie Does Denver"", not to mention ""Debbie Does the National Football League"". Naughty, naughty. And you thought nobody would ever knowt It seems like good old Doctor Knowles on Klesmer Drive had to give you some penicillin shots back in 2021. Is that because of some hanky pinky with Claire Simmons, the woman that you spent a weekend with at the Mountain Lodge in Sun Valley? Yes, you registered under the name of Sam Jones, but you stupidly paid the charges with good o1' VISA card #1245938431223. According to the Silicon Heights Pharmacy database you have had many interesting prescriptions over the last ten years, not the least of which is a common antidepressant drug, which you are still taking, and a drug which is only prescribed for people who have a problem with alcohol. Perhaps your therapist, Dr. Theresa Clemmons, can help you with your depression and perhaps your frequent access to the Alcoholics Anonymous help site over the Global Landscape will help you with your drinking problem. Maybe yon learned your lesson after that escapade with Claire Simmons because on January 10, 2022 you married your present wife, Mary TisweU and just in time to greet that new brindle of joy, Randy, Junior, who was born three weeks later at Silicon Valley Hospital. It seems like you really got into calling someone at 1-900-999-9898 towards the end of 2022, Randy. Does the name Linda the Dominatrix ring a bell? It seems like that is her phone nunaber and she earns her living by talking dirty on the telephone. She told us some of your favorite fantasies. Naughty, naughty! Didn't you find conjugal bliss with Mary, the mother of your son? The surveillance cameras at Silicon Valley Mall are tied into an image database and much to our surprise we found your visage at the Mall Restanrant having lunch with Claire Simmous nearly every day during the spring and summer months of 2023. It's nice to catch up with old friends, but did you have to catch tip at with Claire at the Motel 6 on Route 10 on fourteen successive Monday afternoons? That's what the database says concerning the afternoons of April 24, May 1, May 8 need we go on of that year? Getting bored with married life, huh, Randy? In recent years you have really been into self-projection teclmology, but don't you think that visiting the Naughty Ladies Virtual Brothel six times in one week last December was a bit much? A little self-restraint wouldn't hurt. You were busted on June 10, 2024 for illegally obtaining copyrighted material off of the Global Landscape. That's considered a felony, but Tim Corson is a great lawyer and for a fee of $7,500 he managed to get you off with six months probation, So, Randy,.we hope you took this all in good fun. After all, we only found ont what everyone else already can find out, in the great Global Landscape, the ubiquitous network!

Various studies state that arithmetic, geometry, and measurement are three mathematical disciplines that must be prioritized in early childhood education. This research aims to determine the effect of the Somatic, Auditory, Visual, and Intellectual (SAVI) learning model on the geometric abilities of children aged 5-6 years. This research uses a pre-experimental experimental method with a one-group pretest-posttest design. The sample in this study was 18 children aged 5-6 years old Harapan Bunda Kindergarten Pancung Sol Pesisir Selatan. Data collection was obtained from observation and documentation, then the data was analyzed using paired sample tests. The results obtained in this research are that the SAVI model can improve the geometric abilities of children aged 5-6 years. This is known from the results of the paired sample t-test, which obtained a significance value of 0.000 < 0.05, which means Ho is rejected and Ha is accepted so that children's initial mathematical abilities, geometry, increase through the SAVI learning model. Children may become actively involved in their education with the help of the SAVI learning model, particularly when it comes to teaching them geometric forms. Because the teacher may utilize real items to aid in learning, children can recognize and retain the geometric forms around them as they grow older.

0217d8b8091770091f799905ef9d1e8e96f29bad,Tongues Tied by Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy about Tongue Tie: A Narrative Review,"ABSTRACT Aim and Background The respective review articles aim is to provide an overview as well as describes and enlists different orofacial myofunctional therapy exercises as a modality for tongue tie secondary to surgery. Tongue tie is the basically a connection that joints base of tongue to the floor of mouth. This leads to difficulties various difficulties such as altered speech, oral habits, maligned teeth and many more. During formative years, most children successfully treated of tongue tie by releasing it, but problems start after its correction. That it may can reappear or may lead to same difficulties as prior. Parents and clinicians are only concerned about speech and aesthetics after release of tongue tie. But OMT plays important role ore and post-surgical procedure. OMT help in proper tongue posture along with reducing the probability of tissue reattachment after surgery by exercises. This therapy positively influenced functions by reducing deleterious habits. Methods A review of relevant literature is predicated on articles found using free text terms, mesh terms, and some basic tongue tie as well as tongue tie release pamphlets that were published in English up until the year 2023 in the electronic databases PubMed, EBSCO, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. With the aid of mesh keywords, the initial search yielded 38–40 articles; 20–35 were chosen depending on the requirements. Also we searched for orofacial myofunctional exercises or exercises recommended after tongue tie release. Results Various exercises enlisted in our article that will guide a individual before and after tongue tie release which will give positive outcomes such as proper tongue posture, speech, swallow, regained aesthetics and self-esteem. Conclusion Tongue plays an important role in development of perioral structures as well as in the swallow to good speech articulation and dental occlusion. So, as pediatric dentist its important know that after release of tongue tie what to do and how to maintain. This review article is focused on the various orofacial myofunctional therapy techniques employed for tongue tie but not a single one to describe them.

39f146eb8128a89a1cae3f6ccfc103d405787057,Company-university intersections through service-learning (SL): a systematic review,"The most relevant intersections in society include the relationship between universities and companies for a projection toward the sustainable employability of future graduates. Among the possible intersections, Service-learning (SL) is an educational proposition that may help university students to develop their personal skills, offering them opportunities to learn and practice civic commitment, improving their sense of social and citizen responsibility, and combining academic and community-service learning in a constructed programme where participants train by working on real needs of the environment to optimize and transform the latter. The development of SL programmes in university departments related to technical areas is posing a challenge to faculty members and students, thus it is important to explore this lack of programmes. The main aim of the present study was to identify SL projects and their topics through a systematic review, following the guidelines of the «Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses» (PRISMA) declaration in the knowledge areas of Architecture, Computer Science, Environmental Engineering, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Languages and Systems, from the year 2008 to the year 2023. This review includes 128 articles, which were analyzed with ATLAS. Ti 22. The categorical system employed in this work emerged from the topics of the programmes identified in the selected articles, which were verified by experts in the mentioned fields of knowledge. The agreed categories were: accessibility, learning, social groups, courses, devices, infrastructure, games, environment, landscaping, heritage, software and web. The most relevant conclusions highlight that most of the articles refer to theoretical aspects of SL, showing a lack of data on the practical development of SL programmes and their impact on employability. The largest number of SL programmes are developed in the areas of Architecture, Computer Science and Software Engineering.

af8e65f0751d41e99294d304d13c8796a1eddb55,Health Information Technology: An Updated Systematic Review With a Focus on Meaningful Use,"In the United States, adoption of health information technology (IT) has been accelerated by the meaningful use incentive program, which provides financial incentives to individual health care providers and organizations that demonstrate that they use certified health IT to meet a set of several use criteria specified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (1, 2). This increase in use has been accompanied by a concomitant increase in the number of published evaluations of health IT. Because of the rapidly expanding evidence base, the Office of the National Coordinator requested a systematic update of the literature (3). The objective of this review is to update previous reviews (46) and examine recent evidence that relates health IT functionalities prescribed in meaningful use regulations to health care quality (including process, health, and patient and provider satisfaction outcomes), safety (including medication safety and other manifestations of patient safety), and efficiency (including costs, utilization, timeliness, and time burden of health care). Methods Although we did not develop a formal protocol for this update, we based it on the search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, data collection, and synthesis methods from previous reviews on health IT (46). Data Sources and Search Strategy A 5-person technical expert panel, which included academic, health care delivery, and policy experts in health IT, guided the review process. Literature searches were based on the strategy initially used by Chaudhry and colleagues (4) and updated by Goldzweig (5) and Buntin (6) and their respective colleagues. This strategy uses broad-based search terms for the English-language literature indexed in PubMed. Our initial search covered the period of January 2010 to November 2011. We used a computer-aided screening method (7) to update that search to November 2012, and then updated searches again to August 2013 (Tables 1 and 2 of the Supplement). Our expert panel reviewed the search results and suggested additional articles that may have been missed. Supplement. Tables Study Selection Two expert reviewers used a Web-based system, DistillerSR (8), to independently select studies. Following the methods of our previous reviews, we considered hypothesis-testing studies of health IT effects and descriptive quantitative studies for inclusion. We classified articles as hypothesis-testing if the investigators compared data between groups or across periods and used statistical tests to assess differences. Hypothesis-testing studies were further classified by study design (such as randomized, controlled trials [RCTs]). To be included, a study needed to evaluate a health IT functionality encompassed by the meaningful use regulations. The meaningful use requirements specify 25 criteria for health IT functionality and use (such as Use CPOE for medication orders), of which providers must meet a portion to receive incentive payments (Tables 3 and 4 of the Supplement). Data Synthesis and Analysis Using a structured form, we abstracted information about the following: study design; clinical setting, health care conditions, and aspects of care assessed; research sites; health IT type (commercial or homegrown); meaningful use functionality evaluated; and context and implementation details. We adapted criteria developed to assess health IT applications in patient safety to classify articles according to reported context (4 domains) and implementation details (7 specific components) (9). We used a modified version of the outcome result classification framework (positive, mixed-positive, neutral, or negative), originally used by Buntin and colleagues (6), to assess outcomes. Our adaptations made the classification framework more conservative than the original framework, thus increasing the likelihood that an article's findings would be classified as mixed-positive, neutral, or negative (Table 5 of the Supplement). The functionality evaluated, context domains, implementation components, and article outcomes were classified by dual-review, and conflicts were resolved by consensus. Role of the Funding Source This project was done under contract to the Office of the National Coordinator. Representatives of the Office of the National Coordinator were briefed on study findings and reviewed a draft manuscript but were not involved in the analysis or decision to submit the manuscript for publication. Results We deemed 2482 of 12 678 titles identified in the searches potentially relevant. We excluded 2023 of these after abstract review and another 223 after full-text review. The 236 articles selected for review encompassed 278 outcomes because some articles addressed several aspects of care and outcomes (Figure). The full list of the included studies can be found in the reference list in the Supplement. Quality outcomes (n= 170) were evaluated more than safety (n= 46) and efficiency (n= 62) outcomes combined, and care processes (n= 103) outcomes were more than twice as common as health outcomes (n= 47). Studies with a simple prepost design were most common (31%), followed by RCTs (25%) and time-series studies (11%). More than one half (53%) evaluated commercial health IT products, although approximately one quarter did not report whether the products that were evaluated were commercial or homegrown. Figure. Evidence search and selection. Meaningful Use Functionalities Most studies addressed clinical decision support (CDS)(n= 85 [36%]); computerized provider order entry (CPOE) (n= 49 [21%]); or multifunctional health IT interventions (n= 47 [20%]), which evaluated broad IT interventions, such as electronic health records (EHRs), that encompassed many of the functionalities required under meaningful use. Twelve of the 25 functionalities in the meaningful use regulations, such as capacity to track vital signs or maintain medication allergy lists, were not specifically evaluated in any studies. These features, however, were likely critical to the functionality of IT interventions (such as CDS) that were evaluated in many studies. Nevertheless, for some aspects of meaningful use, such as implement systems to protect privacy and security, no eligible studies were found. Quality Outcomes Overall, 147 articles assessed the effect of health IT on 170 quality-related outcomes (Tables 6 and 7 of the Supplement). More than one half of these studies assessed CDS alerts and reminders; the most commonly studied outcomes were medication management, screening and preventive care, and process quality for diabetes and venous thromboembolism. More than three quarters of studies of alerts and reminders, including large quasi-experimental studies and RCTs, reported positive effects. Notable among these included a 1-year prospective, cluster randomized trial in 12 primary care pediatric practices that reported that EHR-embedded CDS substantially improved the use of asthma control medications, spirometry, and the maintenance of care plans (10); a study of nearly 20 000 surgical patients that found that CDS was associated with a 30% increase in adherence to infection prevention guidelines (11); a controlled before-and-after study compared 360 primary care physicians in New York, New York, with a matched set of control physicians and reported that EHR-sensitive measures of process quality (such as eye examinations and urine testing for patients with diabetes) improved substantially only in practices that received high levels of technical assistance in implementing their EHRs (12); and a before-and-after study showing that a CDS intervention in a commercial health IT system was associated with a significant increase in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and a substantial decline in the rate of venous thromboembolism among nearly 40 000 patients admitted to a single academic medical center (13). Eighteen percent of studies reported no statistically significant improvements in quality or even negative effects. An illustrative example of these studies reported that on the basis of a nationally representative sample of physician office visits, EHRs were associated with poor depression care among patients diagnosed with multiple chronic conditions. The authors of this study hypothesized that EHR workflows gave precedence to the treatment of physical conditions, and therefore psychosocial problems were left unaddressed (14). Safety Outcomes Forty-six studies investigated the effects of health IT functionalities on patient safety outcomes, focusing exclusively on medication safety (Tables 8 and 9 of the Supplement). Approximately 78% of these studies reported at least some positive effects. Of note, benefits were found for a wide range of medication safety outcomes in various care settings. Automated dose calculation features within CPOE systems were found to have significant relative reductions in errors in medication dosage ranging from 37% to 80% (1517), and authors of 1 study reported that innovative features, such as incorporation of an order verification screen with a patient picture, was associated with complete elimination of incorrect patient orders (18). However, a few studies reported that, in some cases, health IT did not have the desired effect on medication safety, and alert fatigue and incongruent workflows were described as barriers to successful use of these systems. Efficiency Outcomes We identified 58 articles that assessed the effect of health IT on 62 efficiency-related outcomes (Tables 10 and 11 of the Supplement). Cost effects ranged from a 75% decrease to a 69% increase in the targeted costs. A few of the studies clustered in the range of 6% to 12% increases in the targeted costs. Understanding the relationship between health IT and health care utilization is complicated by external factors, such as the payment environment in which the health care providers operate. We identified some large studies that reported that patient and provider acces",Annals of Internal Medicine,2014.0,410,"{'url': 'http://annals.org/data/journals/aim/929584/0000605-201401070-00008.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.7326/M13-1531?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.7326/M13-1531, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

60648c7b72316e0f74001ab98465308f0ba0507c,"Performance of the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription Medication, and Other Substance Use (TAPS) Tool for Substance Use Screening in Primary Care Patients","Tobacco and alcohol use are among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States (1, 2), and illicit substance use is a significant contributor to the HIV and opioid overdose epidemics (3, 4). Health care settings offer an opportunity to identify substance use and related problems, provide timely interventions, and guide patients to treatment. Tobacco screening and treatment are core clinical quality measures for primary care (5), and screening followed by a brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol use is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (69). Although the efficacy of brief interventions in reducing drug use has not been clearly established (1013), screening for substance use in medical settings may be clinically justified by the effects of substance use on the prevention and treatment of other medical conditions (1416), as well as the potential for drugmedication interactions (17, 18) and overdose (19). Primary care settings require a screening and assessment approach that is efficient and accurate, and informs clinical care (2023). Although very brief screening tools have been developed to efficiently identify alcohol and drug use (2427), they do not provide enough information about the specific substances used, or the patient's risk level, to guide clinical actions. A structured substance use assessment may provide this information, but current options either are too lengthy (28) or do not provide sufficient detail (29, 30) to meet the needs of medical providers. We developed the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use (TAPS) tool as a better instrument for substance use screening in primary care settings. This tool consists of a 4-item screen for tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, and nonmedical use of prescription medications, followed by a substance-specific assessment of risk level for individuals with positive screening results. The TAPS tool is flexible enough to be administered face to face or self-administered with a tablet computer, so it can accommodate various clinical workflows. This article presents the results from a large multisite study conducted within the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network to assess the performance of the TAPS tool compared with a reference standard measure in adult primary care patients. Supplement. Study Protocol Methods Participants and Recruitment Participants were recruited from 5 primary care clinics in Baltimore, Maryland; New York, New York; Richmond, Virginia; and 2 sites in Kannapolis, North Carolina. Clinics were selected to provide a geographically diverse sample of urban and suburban participants, in whom substance use patterns would be expected to vary. A sample size of 2000 was set before recruitment began, and sites enrolled competitively from August 2014 to April 2015 until that number was reached. Sample size was determined by using computer simulations to calculate the precision of the estimates of sensitivity and specificity as a function of the number of participants and the prevalence of substance use. We determined that a sample size of 2000 would allow us to estimate sensitivity with a precision (defined as the 95th percentile of the half-width of the 95% CI) of 12.5% for substances with a prevalence of 5% and up to 2.5% for those with a prevalence of 50%. Eligibility Criteria Adults aged 18 years or older who were in a clinic for a medical visit and could provide informed consent were eligible to participate. Persons were excluded if they could not comprehend spoken English, were physically unable to complete the self-administered TAPS tool, or were enrolled in this study previously. Recruitment Research assistants (RAs) consecutively approached each patient in the waiting area. Interested patients were screened for eligibility and provided verbal consent. They were given the option of having the study visit before their appointment if the wait time was longer than 1 hour; otherwise, the study encounter occurred after the medical visit. Study Procedures Study visits were completed in a private room. Participants were assigned a unique identifier and were told that responses were confidential and would not be shared with anyone in the clinic. The electronic data capture system randomly assigned half of the participants to begin with the self-administered TAPS tool and half to begin with the interviewer-administered version. After completing the TAPS tool in the first format (for example, self-administered), the participants completed it in the other version (for example, interviewer-administered). The self-administered version was delivered on a tablet computer (iPad, Apple), which gave participants the option of hearing the questions and response options read verbatim by a recorded female voice. For the interviewer version, the RAs read all the questions and response options aloud to the participants. After both versions were completed, the RA administered a questionnaire about the feasibility and acceptability of the TAPS tool; then, additional substance use measures were collected for comparison purposes. The RAs were not blinded to participant responses on the interviewer-administered TAPS tool when they administered the reference standard measure: the modified World Health Organization World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmhcidi/index.php) here referred to as CIDI. After completing self-reported assessments, all participants were asked to provide verbal consent to participate in oral fluid testing for drugs. Participants received $20 for the main study and an additional $10 for oral fluid testing. All study procedures were approved by local institutional review boards (Duke University Health System, Friends Research Institute, New York University School of Medicine, and Virginia Commonwealth University). Measures Experimental Instrument: TAPS Tool The TAPS tool was developed as a 2-step screening and brief assessment approach from instruments that had not been validated. The screening component, TAPS-1, was adapted from NIDA Quick Screen V1.0 (31), whereas the brief assessment component, TAPS-2, is a modified version of the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST)-Lite (32). A prototype of the TAPS tool was evaluated through cognitive interviews (3335) with 30 adult primary care patients from 3 of the study sites. On the basis of these interviews, the wording of TAPS tool items was modified slightly before the instrument was finalized for use in this study. The tool is shown in Figure 1. The TAPS-1 component asked how frequently in the previous 12 months the participant used tobacco, alcohol (above guideline-recommended daily limits: 5 or more drinks per day for men; 4 or more drinks per day for women [36]), illicit drugs, or prescription medications (sedatives, opioids, and stimulants) for nonmedical purposes. Respondents chose from 5 options ranging from never to daily or almost daily. In TAPS-2, participants answered yes or no to questions regarding use of tobacco, alcohol, 6 classes of illicit drugs, and other drugs in the past 3 months. If a participant answered yes to any question, he or she received 2 or 3 follow-up items specific to that substance class. Figure 1. TAPS tool parts 1 and 2, showing items, skip pattern, and scoring system. ADHD = attention deficithyperactivity disorder; GHB = -hydroxybutyrate; LSD = lysergic acid diethylamide; MDMA = 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; TAPS = Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use. * Percocet is a trademark for a combination of acetominophen and oxycodone, manufactured by Endo Pharmaceuticals.

Adderall is a trademark for mixed salts of a single-entity amphetamine product, manufactured by Shire. ** Ritalin is a trademark for methylphenidate hydrochloride, manufactured by Novartis. For TAPS-1, any response other than never constituted a positive result; participants with positive TAPS-1 results completed the corresponding items on TAPS-2, and their responses were summed within each substance class to generate a substance-specific risk score. The scores have a potential range of 0 to 3 for tobacco and other drugs and 0 to 4 for alcohol. In clinical practice, TAPS-2 would be administered only to participants with a positive result on TAPS-1; however, for the purposes of the study, participants completed all of TAPS-2 regardless of TAPS-1 responses. Reference Measures The CIDI was used as the gold standard reference measure. Prior versions of the CIDI have been used widely in epidemiologic and clinical research to assess substance use disorder (SUD) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-4) (3741). As in our previous research (42), we used the existing CIDI items that mapped onto the DSM-5 SUD classifications (by omitting the item on legal problems and including the one on craving). Problem use was defined as past-year use with endorsement of 1 or more items on the CIDI. This approach was taken in previous screening tool studies to identify clinically important substance use that may not be severe enough to meet the criteria for an SUD (42, 43). The definition of an SUD was based on the standard diagnostic threshold of meeting 2 or more DSM criteria on the CIDI. Oral Fluid Testing The Intercept immunoassay (OraSure Technologies) objectively measured point prevalence for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine, phencyclidine, opiates, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates.

48650d477488c8488ef32c6c4b3b956e64015069,Economic Evaluation of Combined Diet and Physical Activity Promotion Programs to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes Among Persons at Increased Risk: A Systematic Review for the Community Preventive Services Task Force,"Diabetes is a highly prevalent, severe, and costly disease in the United States. Approximately 29 million Americans (9.3% of the U.S. population) had diabetes in 2012, and that number is projected to increase (1, 2). Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness, and amputation, as well as a major cause of heart disease and stroke (2). In the United States in 2012, the total medical cost of diagnosed diabetes was estimated at $176 billion, and the cost of productivity loss due to diabetes was another $69 billion (3). Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of diagnosed diabetes. Common risk factors for type 2 diabetes include obesity, family history of diabetes, physical inactivity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and elevated glucose level. In addition, approximately 37% of the U.S. population aged 20 years or older and 51% of those aged 65 years or older had prediabetes in 2012, meaning that they were at increased risk for type 2 diabetes (2). However, only about 10% of at-risk persons knew their risk status (4). Randomized clinical trials around the world have shown that combined diet and physical activity promotion programs could prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes among persons at increased risk (58). Studies have also demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of such programs when they are implemented in primary care or community settings (9). In 2014, a systematic review done for the Community Preventive Services Task Force found that programs implemented in health care or community settings effectively reduced the risk for diabetes in persons at increased risk; increased the likelihood of reversion to normoglycemia; and reduced weight and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as elevated blood pressure and lipid levels (10). Given the potentially large population that is eligible for diet and physical activity promotion programs and the resources needed for implementation, information on program cost and cost-effectiveness is critical for policy decisions, such as benefit coverage for payers, as well as planning for program design and implementation. As a companion to the aforementioned effectiveness review, we did this systematic economic review for the Community Preventive Services Task Force to estimate the cost associated with diet and physical activity promotion programs and the cost-effectiveness and costbenefit ratios of these programs. Methods Data Sources and Searches We searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science, EconLit, and CINAHL for English-language articles published between January 1985 and 7 April 2015. Details of the search strategy are available on the Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide) Web site (www.thecommunityguide.org) and in Appendix Table 1 (11). We also screened reference lists of relevant studies and reviews and considered studies identified by the parallel review of the effectiveness of diet and physical activity promotion programs (10). Appendix Table 1. Search Strategy: Combined Diet and Physical Activity Promotion Programs Among Persons at Increased RiskEconomic Review* Study Selection We included studies that provided information on program cost; costbenefit ratio; or incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is measured as dollars per life-year gained (LYG), quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved, or disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Included studies on program cost had to evaluate the actual program implementation cost. Included cost-effectiveness or costbenefit studies had to meet published criteria for conducting and reporting economic evaluation analysis (12). We used the same inclusion criteria as the aforementioned effectiveness review for study population, intervention, comparison population, and publication language (10). Criteria included a population at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, based on glycemic measures or risk scores for diabetes, presence of cardiovascular disease, or presence of the metabolic syndrome; intervention with both diet and physical activity components delivered in at least 2 contact sessions over at least 3 months; comparison with a similar population receiving either usual care (standard lifestyle advice) or no intervention for the cost-effectiveness studies; and publication in English. We further restricted our review to studies in high-income countries to provide economic estimates relevant to U.S. settings and populations. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Two authors extracted data from each article according to the Cochrane systematic review protocol (13) and the Community Guide protocol for economic evaluations (14). Data Synthesis and Analysis Intervention costs are reported as program costs per participant, including costs to identify eligible participants (through recruitment in the community, referral from providers, or screening and referral in study settings) and to implement the diet and physical activity promotion program (staff time, training materials, and other costs). We also generated program costs per participant per session, calculated by dividing program costs per participant by the total number of core and maintenance sessions delivered. Medians and interquartile intervals (IQIs) of study estimates were reported as summary measures. If there were 4 data points, we reported the range; if there were 3 or fewer data points, all were reported. Subgroup analyses of intervention costs were done to explore potential factors affecting costs. For delivery setting, we grouped each study into those based on the U.S. DPP (Diabetes Prevention Program) study, in which the intervention was delivered in a clinical trial setting following rigorous procedures as described in study protocols (5), and those done in real-world settings, in which diet and physical activity promotion programs were translated to community or primary care settings, with (translational DPP programs) or without (translational non-DPP programs) explicit adaptation of DPP training materials. For delivery method, we categorized each study into 1 of the following groups: individual-based programs, in which a participant met 1-on-1 with the program provider at each core session; group-based programs, in which the participants met as a group with the program provider at each core session; or mixed programs, in which the core sessions included both individual and group sessions. For the type of personnel delivering the program, we grouped each study by whether the program was delivered by health professionals (such as medical staff, physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, case managers, or dietitians), trained laypersons (such as certified diabetes educators, lay health educators, trained community health workers, or trained volunteers with type 2 diabetes), or a mix of health professionals and trained laypersons. Cost-effectiveness estimates were measured as ICERs, with medians and IQIs provided as summary measures. To improve comparability of ICERs across the studies, we reported them separately by the outcome measures used in different studies: QALYs saved, LYGs, or DALYs averted. For studies found to be cost-saving, we calculated the negative net cost per QALY saved, LYG, or DALY averted whenever possible to calculate the median ICER. Two economic perspectives were considered: the health system perspective, in which only medical costs and benefits relevant to health systems were considered, and the societal perspective, in which direct nonmedical and indirect costs were also considered. When studies provided sufficient data, we calculated ICERs for perspectives beyond those reported. As with cost estimates, subgroup analysis of ICERs was done by delivery method. We examined cost-effectiveness estimates by type of analysis: within-trial analysis, in which ICERs were calculated from data on actual costs and benefits; modeling of a trial or extension of trials, in which studies used simulation models to estimate program cost and effectiveness during or beyond the trial period; or modeling of the national effect, in which studies estimated ICERs for programs delivered by scaling up programs to the entire country in which the study was conducted. Because time horizon is important in program planning and budget allocation, we reported ICERs by length of follow-up (short-term [<10 years] or long-term [10 years]). In addition, we reported ICERs stratified by country setting (U.S.- or nonU.S.-based) to better inform programs in the United States. All costs were adjusted to 2013 U.S. dollars by using the Consumer Price Index for medical care services (15) and annual foreign exchange rates from the Federal Reserve Bank for conversion of other currencies (16). If a study did not mention the year used in cost calculations, we assumed costs to be as of 1 year before the study publication year. Interventions were considered cost-effective if the ICER was less than $50000 per QALY saved, less than $50000 per LYG (17), or less than the per capita gross domestic product of the relevant country for cost per DALY averted, as recommended by the World Health Organization (18). Role of the Funding Source This study was done by employees of the U.S. government as part of their official duties and received no external funding. Results After screening, 28 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in our final review (Figure 1) (1946). Of these, 6 cost-only studies (2023, 26, 27) and 6 cost-effectiveness studies (19, 24, 25, 2830) provided information on the actual cost of diet and physical activity promotion programs, and 22 contributed cost-effectiveness estimates of the programs (19, 24, 25, 2846). Fourteen studies were U.S.-based (1924, 26, 27, 31, 3538, 46). No costbenefit studies were identified. Figure 1.

The history of the jetty is not 100% certain, but it is believed that the previous wooden jetty was replaced by the current concrete structure towards the late 1940’s. There were no as-built drawings of the jetty structure available. The jetty was in a deteriorated state and required a very thorough forensic investigation to determine the state of deterioration and to develop a design for the rehabilitation thereof. The forensic study, conducted by a specialist sub-contractor, included ferro-scanning (steel reinforcement number and spacing), core samples, non-destructive testing on the structure and visual inspections. From the investigation it was found that the concrete used for the jetty is generally of good quality (high strength, good compaction, and good aggregate distribution) and cover depths are in most locations in excess of 40 mm. However, after 60 years of marine exposure the structure suffers from very high chloride contamination and severe rebar corrosion damage. Previous repairs were found to generally have failed to offer any noteworthy protection to the structure. Large cracks, spalled concrete and exposed corroded steel reinforcement were evidence of the chloride contamination. A structural analysis to verify the jetty capacity was also completed and it was found that it is imperative that the original cross-sectional area of the piles is restored. The methods proposed and employed to rehabilitate the jetty were patch repair (trowel applied concrete and sprayed concrete), sectional casting of concrete (with formwork), and replacement of reinforcement. The work commenced mid-2016 and was substantially completed end of 2017. 1. Project description Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) appointed Aurecon to investigate the extent of deterioration of the jetty, improve the fender system and design a new coastal revetment to protect the shoreline. Aurecon was also appointed during the construction phase as design consultant, where Steffanutti Stocks Coastal was the contractor, Frontline was the HSE consultant and Sika the preferred material supplier. During the design phase, TNPA requested that the useful life of the jetty should be extended by about 10 years – i.e. up to the year 2023. The site is located approximately 150 km west of Springbok in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. The jetty is currently being used by De Beers as a Supply Chain Centre (SCC) to ship supplies to their offshore mining fleet. The SCC presently charters two supply vessels which operate from Port Nolloth. The history of the jetty very interesting. Some research revealed that the original timber jetty, from where copper ore was exported, was built around 1855. During the late 1940’s a reinforced concrete deck-on-pile structure was constructed utilising the old timber structure as temporary false work. The jetty displayed extensive cracking and spall damage to beams, vertical faces, soffits and piles with corroded reinforcement visible in many places. Other areas where previous repairs were applied also showed signs of deterioration. Figure 1 shows an elevation of the jetty. Figure 1: Elevation of the jetty in Port Nolloth 2. Description of the structure The jetty structure consists of a deck on piles approach bridge and main jetty.

(refer Figure 2 below). Figure 2: Jetty Layout The approach bridge cross section is a 250mm thick reinforced concrete slab over a 735mm deep compacted sand fill, contained by a 180mm concrete slab below, as shown in Figure 3. The total width, including a 1m wide service duct, is approximately 8.8m. The approach bridge deck is supported by 600mm deep and 500mm wide beams at a spacing of approximately 3m centre-tocentre. At most beams of the approach bridge there are only two vertical 300x300mm concrete piles with an additional two raking piles at four places along the approach bridge. Figure 3: Approach bridge cross-section The main jetty cross section is a 250mm thick reinforced concrete slab over a 1035mm deep compacted sand fill, contained by a 215mm concrete slab below, as shown in Figure 4. The total width, including a 1.1m wide service duct, is approximately 13.3m. The main jetty deck is supported by downstand/upstand beams, combined depth about 1050mm, with width 500mm at a spacing of approximately 3m centre-to-centre. At all beams of the main jetty there are three vertical and two raking 300x300mm concrete piles. Figure 4: Main jetty cross-section 3. Forensic Investigation Overview and Results A forensic investigation was conducted by subcontractors in July to August 2013 to determine the true extent of the corrosion and deterioration of the jetty structure. The output of the forensic investigation was used to determine the suitable repair procedures.
