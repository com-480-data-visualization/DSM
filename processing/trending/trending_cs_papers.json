    "title": "The Impact of COVID-19 and \u201cEmergency Remote Teaching\u201d on the UK Computer Science Education Community",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed \u201cemergency remote teaching\u201d across education globally, leading to the closure of institutions across a variety of settings, from early-years through to higher education. This paper looks specifically at the impact of these changes to those teaching the discipline of computer science in the UK. Drawing on the quantitative and qualitative findings from a large-scale survey of the educational workforce (N=2,197) conducted in the immediate aftermath of institutional closures in March 2020 and the shift to online delivery, we report how those teaching computer science in various UK settings (n=214) show significantly more positive attitudes towards the move to online learning, teaching and assessment than those working in other disciplines; these perceptions were consistent across schools, colleges and higher education institutions. However, whilst practitioners noted the opportunities of these changes for their respective sector \u2013 especially a renewed focus on the importance of digital skills \u2013 they raised a number of generalisable concerns on the impact of this shift to online on their roles, their institutions and their sectors as a whole; for example, the impact on workload, effective pedagogy and job fragility. More specifically for computer science practitioners, curricula and qualifications, there were concerns raised regarding the ability to meaningfully deliver certain core topics such as mathematical foundations and programming, as well as the impact on various types of formal examinations and assessment. Based on the data obtained from this rapid response survey, we offer informed commentary, evaluation and recommendations for emerging learning and teaching policy and practice in the UK computer science community as we move into the 2020-2021 academic year and beyond.",

    "abstract": "This research aimed to investigate the requirements of the application of the STEM approach in teaching science and mathematics and the teachers\u2019 attitudes towards it. The study used descriptive approach. The study sample consisted of (159) male and female teachers chosen by the random stratified sample method from the study community represented by all science, mathematics and computer teachers in Ajloun Governorate in the academic year 2019/2020. The scale of requirements for applying the STEM approach and teachers\u2019 attitudes towards it was developed; the validity and reliability of the study instrument were verified by appropriate statistical methods. Statistical processing was done using arithmetic means, and the analysis of multiple variance analysis. The results showed that the teachers \u2018assessments of the requirements of the STEM approach are all high and above the hypothetical average (75%). \u201cChanging the teaching methods\u201d dimension came in the first place with an arithmetic mean (30, 29), followed by the dimension of \u201cchanging the learning goals\u201d with an arithmetic mean (30.15). The third place was for \u201cchanging the vision and skills of teachers\u201d dimension with an arithmetic mean (30.13), and the last place was for the domain of \u201cchanging the classroom environment\u201d with an arithmetic mean (22.37). It showed that teachers\u2019 attitudes toward STEM teaching are positive and high. And there were no statistically significant differences at the level (0.05) in the male and female teachers\u2019 assessments of the requirements of STEM application and their attitudes towards it. On the other hand, there are statistically significant differences in their estimates according to the phase variable and in favor of the elementary stage. There were statistically significant differences according to the variable of specialization and for the benefit of science and mathematics teachers compared to Computer ones. And in light of the results, the study presented a set of recommendations.",

    "title": "Will 2020 be remembered as the year in which education was changed?",
    "abstract": "(adapted from other old stories) Once upon a time there was a man who studied at a university how to teach dogs to bark. After completing his degree he could not get employment, so he continued with his studies and completed a PhD in his field, and was appointed at his university to train students to teach dogs how to bark. Not many students studied with him. Then a terrible virus, affecting dogs and causing them to lose their ability to bark, hit the world and caused a worldwide pandemic. Not everybody was equally unhappy\u2014after all, barking dogs can be rather noisy. Rumours, that this virus could be man-made, were heard. The virus spread exponentially and soon few dogs remained that could bark. And the world was quite quiet. Suddenly his discipline was very popular and all over the world new experts started writing important articles and books and blogs on how dogs should be taught how to bark. International companies launched big money-making projects and many teachers and scholars boarded the band-wagon. Unfortunately not all attempts were successful\u2014teaching a dog how to bark does not always imply that the dog will learn how to bark. But some were. And the man had a little smile. And more students. And, although somewhat differently, they could live happily ever after. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. In response to COVID-19, many countries have applied strict social distancing measures and a lockdown policy. The pandemic has had a serious impact on schools, students and teachers. Students and teachers have not been allowed to visit schools and universities physically and most institutions have transformed to an online teaching and learning approach. After being faced with the reality of COVID-19, following measures introduced by governments all over the world, and the various arrangements made by schools and universities in compliance with these measures, students and teachers have had to make drastic changes to the traditional teaching and learning approach, working and learning from home. The world of teaching and learning has changed dramatically and we find ourselves relying on technology to conduct lectures and other teaching and learning activities. Our students are in remote locations away from campus, and we connect with them using technology. Despite all of these changes, life goes on, and we have to live with this reality, which is now referred to as \u2018a new normal\u2019 (Sehoole 2020). At many institutions, online offerings included the uploading of learning materials onto learning management systems, procurement of laptops for students who did not have access to computers, and the securing of free data for accessing the course material to ensure that online learning did not become prohibitive to students and staff in terms of costs. Many teachers and students had to transition to this new mode of delivery. Digital communication, including lessons, assessment tasks, engagement with students and virtual committee meetings have become \u2018a new normal\u2019. As a consequence of COVID-19, digital literacy and attributes that were previously difficult to address, are being fostered in students to help them successfully navigate the twenty-first century (Sehoole 2020). This situation makes online and blended learning even more relevant than before. The educational problems and solutions have been (tongue-in-cheek) referred to as Panic-gogy\u2014for * Johann Engelbrecht johann.engelbrecht@up.ac.za",

Evidence review topics of particular interest include the use of suction in the presence of both clear and meconium-stained amniotic fluid, sustained inflations for initiation of positive-pressure ventilation, initial oxygen concentrations for initiation of resuscitation in both preterm and term infants, use of epinephrine (adrenaline) when ventilation and compressions fail to stabilize the newborn infant, appropriate routes of drug delivery during resuscitation, and consideration of when it is appropriate to redirect resuscitation efforts after significant efforts have failed. All sections of the Neonatal Resuscitation Algorithm are addressed, from preparation through to postresuscitation care. This document now forms the basis for ongoing evidence evaluation and reevaluation, which will be triggered as further evidence is published. Over 140 million babies are born annually worldwide (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/births-and-deaths-projected-to-2100). If up to 5% receive positive-pressure ventilation, this evidence evaluation is relevant to more than 7 million newborn infants every year. However, in terms of early care of the newborn infant, some of the topics addressed are relevant to every single baby born.",

    "abstract": "Background COVID-19 is currently rampant in China, causing unpredictable harm to humans. This study aimed to quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the research trends on coronaviruses using bibliometric analysis to identify new prevention strategies. Methods All relevant publications on coronaviruses were extracted from 2000\u20132020 from the Web of Science database. An online analysis platform of literature metrology, bibliographic item co-occurrence matrix builder (BICOMB) and CiteSpace software were used to analyse the publication trends. VOSviewer was used to analyse the keywords and research hotspots and compare COVID-19 information with SARS and MERS information. Results We found a total of 9,760 publications related to coronaviruses published from 2000 to 2020. The Journal of Virology has been the most popular journal in this field over the past 20 years. The United States maintained a top position worldwide and has provided a pivotal influence, followed by China. Among all the institutions, the University of Hong Kong was regarded as a leader for research collaboration. Moreover, Professors Yuen KY and Peiris JSM made great achievements in coronavirus research. We analysed the keywords and identified 5 coronavirus research hotspot clusters. Conclusions We considered the publication information regarding different countries, institutions, authors, journals, etc. by summarizing the literature on coronaviruses over the past 20 years. We analysed the studies on COVID-19 and the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. Notably, COVID-19 must become the research hotspot of coronavirus research, and clinical research on COVID-19 may be the key to defeating this epidemic.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic aroused global public concern and became a major medical issue. This study aims to investigate the global research routine and trends of coronavirus over the last twenty years based on the production, hotspots, and frontiers of published articles as well as to provide the global health system with a bibliometric reference. The Web of Science core collection database was retrieved for coronavirus articles published from 1 January 2000 to 17 March 2020. Duplicates and discrete papers were excluded. Analysis parameters including time, regions, impact factors, and citation times were processed through professional software. A total of 9043 coronavirus articles originated from 123 countries and were published in 1202 journals. The USA contributed most articles (3101) followed by China (2230). The research was published in specialized journals including the Journal of Virology. Universities were the main institutions of science progress. High-impact articles covered fields of basic science and clinical medicine. There were two sharp increases in research yields after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks. International collaborations promoted study progress, and universities and academies act as the main force in coronavirus research. More research on prevention and treatment is needed according to an analysis of term density.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to interpret, analyse, and critique educational pasts, presents, and futures. It is framed by potentially falsifiable memories of colonization and struggles for identity and social justice. We adopt the device of social science fiction (Gerlach and Hamilton 2003) as a specialist genre of speculative fiction (Graham et al. 2019). Such speculative approaches seek to develop provocations rather than predictions (Selwyn et al. 2020) and to implicate their readers rather than to inculcate them. In this tradition, we seek to ponder possibilities of post-pandemic educational futurities. Our work centres on the ramblings of an unknown scholar who, on the cusp of a postscientific world, screams a maddened poem into the void titled \u2018The Pandemic will not be on Zoom\u2019. The events surrounding this poem are pieced together to reveal a world of stark inequities and digital and biological fractures. These fractures prefigured a bleak colonization of humankind by a deepmind hive Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Fig. 1) that caused us to become forever isolated from ourselves and that brought an end to the grand projects of science and education. In our conclusion, we call for other historians Postdigital Science and Education https://doi.org/10.1007/s42438-020-00150-3",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to determine the effect of individual cyber security skills of pre-service teachers on their attitudes towards computer-assisted education. Thus, the present research was designed as a correlational study. The study participants included 241 senior pre-service teachers in different departments at Manisa Celal Bayar University, Faculty of Education during the 2019-2020 academic year the fall semester. The data were collected with the \"Personal Cyber Security Provision Scale\" and \"The Attitude Toward Computer-Assisted Education Scale.\" Based on the study findings, pre-service teachers should improve their competency in cyber security. Furthermore, pre-service teachers who owned a personal computer had higher scores in maintaining personal cyber security and had better attitudes towards computer-assisted education. Besides, it was observed that there were differences between personal cyber security scores of pre-service teachers and their attitudes towards computer-assisted education based on their departments. Furthermore, it was identified that the personal cyber security achievement score was a significant predictor of the attitude towards computer-assisted education. In the final section of the study, various recommendations are presented for future studies and applications on the subject.",

    "title": "A Five-Year Retrospective on an Applied Baccalaureate Program in Software Development",
    "abstract": "This experience report documents an intervention that started five years ago, in 2014. Green River College, a community college in a suburb of Seattle, Washington, launched a new applied baccalaureate program in Software Development, with a goal of preparing place-bound, underrepresented, and underserved students for employment as entry-level software developers. At program inception, community college baccalaureate degrees were relatively new across the nation and there was little precedent established in terms of program design, particularly as these new degree programs were not intended to emulate traditional undergraduate Computer Science programs, but rather provide an alternative pathway to the baccalaureate and workforce. The Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) in Software Development is designed as a \"2+2\" program, where students enter the program at third-year/junior-level standing after completing their two-year applied associate degree. The BAS Software Development curriculum includes courses in both \"computer science fundamentals\" and industry-focused, project-based learning courses. Since program inception, the curriculum has evolved based on evidence and feedback from students, instructors, alumni, and industry partners. Initial key results at the five-year mark include a review of enrollment, completion, diversity, and placement data. As of June 2019, the program has 132 graduates (degrees conferred), with 52 new students on track to enter the program in the 2019-2020 academic year. A recent snapshot of currently enrolled students indicates the median age is 24, 23% are women, 40% are students of color, 39% are first generation college students, and 40% are receiving need-based financial aid. Graduates of the program have placed into roles that include Software Development Engineers, Solutions Engineers, and Technical Program Managers.",

    "title": "PS: Political Science & Politics Editors\u2019 Report, 2019\u20132020",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION PS: Political Science & Politics is in its 53rd year of publication. The editorial team strives to maintain the particular niche that PS occupies among the APSA portfolio of publications as an outlet for brief and non-technical articles featuring new research, political science commentary and research on timely political and social events, research into and discussion of the political science discipline, and scholarship on teaching and pedagogy. PS serves as a primary outlet for research on the profession, and we\u2019ve been proud to publish important articles and symposia that highlight the challenges of broadening and diversifying our profession (and academia) and combating conscious and unconscious biases in hiring, promotion, and peer review. We feel an important sense of responsibility to provide an outlet for disciplinary debates, but this has also opened up PS to some controversy as debates that first appear in our pages spill out into social media. We thank our Editorial Board, the Publications Policy Committee, and the APSA leadership for helping us navigate these discussions. As examples, we have upcoming symposia on racial equity in the profession; teaching during a pandemic (this is being fast-tracked); and open science and transparency in research. We do not expect that every reader will agree with the conclusions reached by the authors of these articles, but we are proud PS is able to feature these discussions\u2014and responses\u2014that are critical to the profession. Symposia have become a major part of the content published in PS and the Altmetric scores and other social media discussions indicate these are popular with our readership. Because symposia focus on special topics, we have developed a process to partner with guest editors, both to be able to draw upon their subject matter expertise and to help identify potential Board members and possibly candidates for editorial positions. This year, we have added a few new procedures to help us manage the symposium peer review process. In particular, PS has added new checks to assure nothing is issued an acceptance or rejection without close oversight by one of the primary editors (other aspects of the review process are managed by guest editors in close consultation and partnership with the PS editorial team). We are cognizant that our term as editors is nearing completion in two years. With this in mind, we are working to systematize and document the editorial policies and procedures, expand the PS social media profile, and work with the APSA Council\u2019s Publications Policy Committee to lay the groundwork for a smooth transition to the next editorial team. We also continue to advocate for regular communications between the managing editors for all the APSA journals and standardized reporting on the demographics of our submission and peer review process across all the journals. We believe this communication would improve the ability of the Council and members of the profession to review and compare performance and evaluation, as well as reducing the load for editorial teams. Among the other things we have done this year to start to prepare for the editorial transition: \u2022 Put in place a data deposit policy to improve replicability and transparency; \u2022 Continued to systematize submission and peer review policies for symposia; \u2022 Continued to reach out to underrepresented scholars, scholars outside the United States, and scholars from institutions with more teaching and service orientations. \u2022 Requested several Board members to extend their term to maintain continuity; \u2022 Recruited new Board members by reaching out to our current Board and to symposia guest editors;",

    "title": "2020 - A TIME OF CRISIS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING, PANDEMIC COVID-19 - TIME TO STRENGTHEN SCIENCE AND HOPE TO FACE LIFE - EDITORIAL",
    "abstract": "\u00a0Two thousand twenty was an awkward and challenging year. Snatched up by a virus, All of a sudden, we saw ourselves working at home. We were physically away from some of the ones we love and from a daily life we were already used to. We have been living a different and introspective year, with social distance under isolation and solitude. At this time, we had the opportunity to withdraw and rethink our purposes, attitudes, values, and our place in the world. We have the chance to think about the meaning of life, look around and see the relationships we have established with one another, with my brotherhood, and with all living and non-living beings that inhabit this planet, our \u201cCommon Home\u201d.It is difficult to think of something more challenging and able to test our resilience! This is not only from a personal point of view, but also from a social, economic and environmental point of view. That is why it is important to talk about resilience, discuss it, test it, prove it and approve it. Such resilience has made us face this Pandemic - COVID-19 and fight for our existence, fight for health, look for respect, welcome and solidarity.Many were the examples of people and companies that helped with donations, delivered masks, hospital equipment, food and so on across all places and cities. But the challenges went further. Many hospital beds and ICUs had to be installed. Health professionals, doctors, nurses and so many others were had to and still face this struggle. They are anonymous generals in their barracks who fought this War of Death for Life. Unfortunately, not everyone could be saved from COVID. The number of those who were treated and recovered in Brazil was 6,501.341 people and 44,169.851 patients worldwide, considering this year, 2020. But 2020 will be remembered as a catastrophe and calamity, because despite efforts many fell down. The causalities\u2019 numbers was in Brazil 188,259 and 1,722.307 in the world. An invaluable loss of human life.We also had other losses such as economic, environmental and social, especially in health. Many will be left with afterpains and a weakened wellbeing as a result of this virus infection; thus, it will not be possible to evaluate the extent of this problem. Many people have gotten worse or developed psycho-emotional pathologies such as depression, panic, among them, and their quality of life has been permanently affected.Many challenges since we have been living under a restricted mobility around the world, which had never been witnessed. There were empty streets, closed shops, bus stations and airports without people for several months.It should be told that political crises, the science negationism, discriminatory acts, polarization regarding data and fake news have exacerbated this crisis. A lot of misinformation, attacks on the environment and a sever backtracking of environmental protection laws and regulations, dismantling of environmental policies, fire was set in Amazon and in Midwestern Brazil that have reached the highest levels in centuries. A relatively large group of Brazilian citizens and in other countries who said they did not believe on how risky Corona virus could be. They neither believe in press information nor insisted on crowding in bars, streets and beaches, as soon as these spaces were opened. We consider unthinkable and even irrational attitudes with scientific knowledge nowadays, since they put their lives and the population\u2019s at risk. Future is the judge of all actions, therefore, the results will be known only tomorrow.The researchers who make up the International Research Network on Climate Resilient Development - RIPEDRC have not faded! They proposed themselves to overcome this challenge of seeking resilience and sustainability! So, with Faith in our life ideals and in a superior motivation that guides our steps and makes us overcome challenges, we have launched to public notices, investigated, questioned and disseminated knowledge supported by several projects, live lectures, events and workshops. They created programs, joint projects and online platforms were developed. In Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina Trinational Border region, the Western Paran\u00e1 State University - UNIOESTE, was in charge or partner of many efforts, among which we highlight two experiences that RIPEDRC Network participants took part.\u00a0",

    "abstract": "Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most faculty in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) began working from home, including many who were simultaneously caring for children. The objective was to assess associations of gender and parental status with self-reported academic productivity before (i.e., mid-January to mid-March 2020) and during the pandemic (i.e., mid-March to mid-May 2020). Materials and Methods: STEMM faculty in the United States (N\u2009=\u2009284, 67.6% women, 57.0% with children younger than the age of 18 years living at home) completed a survey about the number of hours worked and the frequency of academic productivity activities. Results: There was no significant difference in the hours worked per week by gender (men, M [standard deviation, SD]\u2009=\u200945.8 [16.7], women\u2009=\u200943.1 [16.3]). Faculty with 0-5-year-old children reported significantly fewer work hours (33.7 [13.9]) compared to all other groups (No children\u2009=\u200949.2 [14.9], 6-11 years old\u2009=\u200948.3 [13.9], and 12-17 years old\u2009=\u200949.5 [13.9], p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Women's self-reported first/corresponding author's and coauthor's article submissions decreased significantly between the two time periods; men's productivity metrics did not change. Faculty with 0-5-year-old children completed significantly fewer peer review assignments, attended fewer funding panel meetings, and submitted fewer first authors' articles during the pandemic compared to the previous period. Those with children aged 6 years or older at home or without children at home reported significant increases or stable productivity. Conclusions: Overall, significant disparities were observed in academic productivity by gender and child age during the pandemic and if confirmed by further research, should be considered by academic institutions and funding agencies when making decisions regarding funding and hiring as well as promotion and tenure.",

    "abstract": "This narrative is a personal account of my evolution as a student of phytoplankton and the ocean. Initially I focused on phytoplankton nutrient physiology and uptake, later switching to photosynthetic physiology. Better models of photosynthesis naturally require a better understanding of spectral underwater light fields and absorption coefficients, which precipitated my involvement in the nascent field of bio-optical oceanography. Establishment of the now 34-year-old summer graduate course in ocean optics, which continues to attract students from around the globe, is a legacy of my jumping into optics. The importance of social interactions in advancing science cannot be underestimated; a prime example is how a TGIF gathering led to my immersion in the world of autonomous underwater vehicles for the past two decades of my career. Working with people who you like and respect is also critical; I believe collegial friendship played a major role in the great success of the 2008 North Atlantic Bloom Experiment.

Abstract Willow (Salix L.) species have good qualities for becoming a biomass crop for production of biofuels. They grow on marginal soils, produce high yields of wood in a short period of time, and are easily propagated. Salix is one of the few genera that may be cryopreserved as dormant winter buds (DBs) instead of using tissue culture techniques. The objective of our study was to evaluate selected factors that affect cryotolerance of nine Salix germplasm accessions in the USDA-ARS National Plant Germplasm System collection. One-year-old branches harvested in January over 3 yr were cut into either 6to 7or 10-cm segments containing at least two DBs. Segments were treated with a slow-cooling procedure and stored in vapor-phase liquid N (LNV). Control segments were stored at \u22125 \u25e6C until planting. The LNV-exposed and the \u22125 \u25e6C-stored nodal segments were warmed and directly planted in a cold greenhouse. Six weeks later, the material was evaluated for shoot and root development. Segments that developed a shoot were considered viable. Average viability varied among years (0\u201335.1%) even for the same accession, species (4.2\u201351.4%), and segment length. Dormant buds on 10-cm segments had higher average viability (82.2%) than did DBs on 6to 7-cm segments (43.9%), suggesting higher suitability for cryopreservation.

    "abstract": "The year 2020 has been an exceptional year for countries across the globe. In India, apart from Covid19, one of the important changes that took place was the development of the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Time by time, various committees have recommended increasing the allocation of the budget for education to 6% of the GDP, this has lead to the interests of researchers. This paper aims to identify the concerns and focus of NEP 2020. The authors have utilized qualitative data analysis techniques to understand critical areas of focus of policy documents and computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software to address the issues. The research also uses data from Twitter. The data (policy documents) was downloaded from the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) website. For a better understanding of the collected data, Word Cloud, TreeMap, Project Map, and The Mind Map, along with the graphical representation of sentiments of stakeholders, is presented in the paper. The paper identifies three crucial aspects of the policy \u2013 course, language, and students, for the higher education sector. This paper also discusses the sentiment analysis, related to NEP 2020. It was found that most people consider the policy as a positive and welcoming step.",

    "abstract": "The study aims to determine the influence of the Problem Based Learnimg (PBL) learning model and the motivation to students critical thinking skills, as well as the interaction between learning models and the motivation to learn from students critical thinking skills. This study was conducted at SD Negeri 105390 in the even semester of the 2019/2020 school year. The population in this study is a class V student of elementary school 105390 Island pictures numbering at 55 people. Sampling is carried out in total, i.e. V-A and V-B classes. The V-B class as an experimental class taught with a collaborative problem-based learning (PBL) model with the number of students 28 people. As for the control class is taught by a direct instruction model elected class V-A with the number of students as many as 27 people. This type of research includes research quasi experiments with 2x2 factorial design with analytical techniques variance (ANAVA) 2 lines. Based on the results of the analysis and research findings from the field obtained several conclusions that are answers to questions on the problem formulation, among them the critical thinking ability of students taught with a collaborative Problem-based learning model better than students taught with a direct learning model (sig. = 0.000 < 0.05), a student's critical thinking ability of high motivation is better than a low-motivation student (sig. = 0.01 < 0.05), and there is interaction between the two learning models with a level of motivation in influencing students ' critical thinking ability (sig. = 0.02 < 0.05).",

    "title": "An investigation of transmission control measures during the first 50 days of the COVID-19 epidemic in China",
    "abstract": "The most effective interventions By 23 January 2020, China had imposed a national emergency response to restrict travel and impose social distancing measures on its populace in an attempt to inhibit the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, which measures were most effective is uncertain. Tian et al. performed a quantitative analysis of the impact of control measures between 31 December 2019 and 19 February 2020, which encompasses the Lunar New Year period when millions of people traveled across China for family visits. Travel restrictions in and out of Wuhan were too late to prevent the spread of the virus to 262 cities within 28 days. However, the epidemic peaked in Hubei province on 4 February 2020, indicating that measures such as closing citywide public transport and entertainment venues and banning public gatherings combined to avert hundreds of thousands of cases of infection. It is unlikely that this decline happened because the supply of susceptible people was exhausted, so relaxing control measures could lead to a resurgence. Science, this issue p. 638 Travel restrictions and the national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Responding to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus [agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] in December 2019, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January 2020 and implemented a national emergency response. We investigated the spread and control of COVID-19 using a data set that included case reports, human movement, and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days. Cities that implemented control measures preemptively reported fewer cases on average (13.0) in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later (20.6). Suspending intracity public transport, closing entertainment venues, and banning public gatherings were associated with reductions in case incidence. The national emergency response appears to have delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, averting hundreds of thousands of cases by 19 February (day 50).",

    "abstract": "Literature-based discovery (LBD) aims to discover valuable latent relationships between disparate sets of literatures. This paper presents the first inclusive scientometric overview of LBD research. We utilize a comprehensive scientometric approach incorporating CiteSpace to systematically analyze the literature on LBD from the last four decades (1986\u20132020). After manual cleaning, we have retrieved a total of 409 documents from six bibliographic databases and two preprint servers. The 35 years\u2019 history of LBD could be partitioned into three phases according to the published papers per year: incubation (1986\u20132003), developing (2004\u20132008), and mature phase (2009\u20132020). The annual production of publications follows Price\u2019s law. The co-authorship network exhibits many subnetworks, indicating that LBD research is composed of many small and medium-sized groups with little collaboration among them. Science mapping reveals that mainstream research in LBD has shifted from baseline co-occurrence approaches to semantic-based methods at the beginning of the new millennium. In the last decade, we can observe the leaning of LBD towards modern network science ideas. In an applied sense, the LBD is increasingly used in predicting adverse drug reactions and drug repurposing. Besides theoretical considerations, the researchers have put a lot of effort into the development of Web-based LBD applications. Nowadays, LBD is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary and involves methods from information science, scientometrics, and machine learning. Unfortunately, LBD is mainly limited to the biomedical domain. The cascading citation expansion announces deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence as emerging topics in LBD. The results indicate that LBD is still growing and evolving.",

    "title": "Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in two Indian states",
    "abstract": "Epidemiology in southern India By August 2020, India had reported several million cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with cases tending to show a younger age distribution than has been reported in higher-income countries. Laxminarayan et al. analyzed data from the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, which have developed rigorous contact tracing and testing systems (see the Perspective by John and Kang). Superspreading predominated, with 5% of infected individuals accounting for 80% of cases. Enhanced transmission risk was apparent among children and young adults, who accounted for one-third of cases. Deaths were concentrated in 50- to 64-year-olds. Incidence did not change in older age groups, possibly because of effective stay-at-home orders and social welfare programs or socioeconomic status. As in other settings, however, mortality rates were associated with older age, comorbidities, and being male. Science, this issue p. 691; see also p. 663 The epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in southern India shows marked differences from that observed in higher-income countries. Although most cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have occurred in low-resource countries, little is known about the epidemiology of the disease in such contexts. Data from the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh provide a detailed view into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission pathways and mortality in a high-incidence setting. Reported cases and deaths have been concentrated in younger cohorts than would be expected from observations in higher-income countries, even after accounting for demographic differences across settings. Among 575,071 individuals exposed to 84,965 confirmed cases, infection probabilities ranged from 4.7 to 10.7% for low-risk and high-risk contact types, respectively. Same-age contacts were associated with the greatest infection risk. Case fatality ratios spanned 0.05% at ages of 5 to 17 years to 16.6% at ages of 85 years or more. Primary data from low-resource countries are urgently needed to guide control measures.",

The study group consisted of 24 third grade students studying in the 2019-2020 academic year. Teaching was done with a 5E (enter, explore, explain, elaborate, evaluate) instructional model, and student opinions about the STEM activities were collected. A group pretest-posttest research design was used in which the \"Let's Know the Matter Test (MT)\" was administered at the beginning to measure the students' prior knowledge, and again at the end of the unit to determine what students had learned. Their opinions of the lessons taught with STEM-focused activities were collected using a semi-structured interview technique. Qualitative data were divided into appropriate categories under common themes. It was observed that the 5E instructional model contributed to their academic success. Also, it was found that their opinions about the lessons taught with STEM activities were quite positive. Based on the results obtained from the research, it is suggested that STEM activities be used in the teaching of other topics.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin is considered to be most valuable and expensive currency in the world. Besides being first decentralized digital currency, its value has also experienced a steep increase, from around 1 dollar in 2010 to around 18000 in 2017. In recent years, it has attracted considerable attention in a diverse set of fields, including economics, finance and computer science. In economics, the primary focus has always been on studying how it affects the market, determining reasons behinds its price fluctuations, and predicting its future prices. In computer science, the focus is on its vulnerabilities, scalability, and other techno-cryptoeconomic issues. Firstly, we are going to collect the historical data of Bitcoin prices over the years 2013 to 2019 and do prediction for the year 2020. We have aimed to justify the usefulness of traditional Autoregressive Integrative Moving Average (ARIMA) model for predicting bitcoin prices. We have predicted the closing price of bitcoin for first seven days of January 2020. Further, we have created web services using ASP.NET to make the predictions on bitcoin price online and lastly, we have plotted the results in a responsive chart using Highcharts.",

    "title": "Which prototyping skills should we teach in first-year design? The answer is as few as possible",
    "abstract": "Engineering design teams are most successful when members possess a broad range of skills to tackle a project. Instructors of design courses are challenged to select and teach the most important skills they believe will be useful for students now and in the future. Some skills, including teaming and engineering design process skills, can be acquired in a short period of time by applying evidence-based training models. But in terms of prototyping, since there are so many tools and machines available, the question arises of which are truly critical to student success. In first-year design at Rice University, a course that has existed for almost ten years, we aim to teach students only the prototyping skills needed to complete their projects. Students participate in just three workshops that are prototyping related, two of which are required (hand tools and electronics) and an optional third (CAD). By recording student prototyping and measuring experience gains, we have investigated how skills contribute to project completion. The results illustrate that the question for first-year design education is not how many prototyping skills can be taught, but how few an instructor can get away with. Introduction Engineering design is a rich field, and professional engineers must apply a variety of tools and techniques in a process ranging from project identification to the implementation of a final product. Engineers use computation, computer aided design, and an assortment of manufacturing tools to create, prototype, and test their designs. In engineering design education, instructors seek to introduce these techniques and train students up to a working level of proficiency. Meeting these broad course objectives requires careful planning and a suitable educational model. Effective skills training should teach underlying concepts, demonstrate proper usage of tools, dedicate time for learners to practice, and most importantly, provide feedback to the learners [1]. Well-implemented training can lead to safer practices, increased performance, and fewer mistakes. When skills are taught effectively in a class, students see positive results both individually and as teams [2]. When teaching such an extensive field as engineering design, it becomes clear that there are far too many topics to cover in the span of a semester. As a result, instructors face the challenge of deciding which elements to include or omit in their curriculum. This problem is magnified in a first-year engineering design course, where in addition to teaching the engineering design process, an alternate goal is often to provide students fundamental skills that may be useful in their academic and professional careers. Therefore, first-year design teachers must be highly deliberate in allocating their limited time and resources. Research on cognitive load theory suggests that the way information is presented impacts not only how rapidly students can learn new concepts, but also how long students retain knowledge and how effectively they transfer it to practice [3-5]. Cognitive load theory proposes that above all, cognitive overload should be avoided. Cognitive overload can occur when learners try to process too much new information in a short time period, and it has detrimental effects on the absorption and transfer of knowledge. A prevalent method for preventing cognitive overload is to decrease extraneous cognitive load, which refers to any teaching or activity that does not directly contribute to overall learning objectives [6,7]. This research supports the notion of eliminating all parts of a curriculum that are not strictly necessary for the desired learning outcomes. In this study, we measured the level of experience of students in an introductory engineering design course to evaluate how the skills that were taught were utilized in the class. By interpreting these measurements and examining individual cases where skills had a notable impact on performance, we can draw inferences about effective approaches for course organization and teaching. Experimental Methods This study was conducted in an Introduction to Engineering Design course whose enrollment during the study was 81. In the first half of the class, students teams gathered information and developed initial solutions to real-world design problems. Students filled out a questionnaire reporting their level of experience with several prototyping tools before beginning to build and test physical prototypes of their designs in the second half. The same survey was given at the end of the semester, and a two-tailed t-test was used to assess students\u2019 gains in experience with each tool or skill during the course. Another survey recorded student demographics. In conjunction with these data, the skills and performance of three teams were also examined. These cases are a sampling of the successes and challenges that teams encountered, and their outcomes are evaluated with respect to course objectives. This research is IRB exempt because data was collected using direct observation of students\u2019 work through required course materials. Results and Discussion Student Population The class consisted of 55.6% male and 44.4% female students (n=81). 46.9% of the students were Caucasian, 21.0% were Asian American, 12.3% were Hispanic, 6.2% were African American, and 13.6% were international. The students\u2019 majors are not reported since most had not yet declared their major at the time of data collection. 70 students completed the skills survey both before and after the prototyping unit, allowing comparison of paired responses. Prototyping Tools/Skills Experience The skills survey evaluated students\u2019 level of experience with a selection of prototyping tools. Some of these are supported in the course via instructional workshops. Others, like manufacturing skills, are useful for high-fidelity prototypes but do not belong in an introductory curriculum. Table 1 reports the statistical significance of changes in the survey responses. It also indicates whether each skill was supported and describes the instructional methods used. Table 1. Prototyping tools/skills used in the course and evaluated via survey.

It is not considered a core component of the curriculum and is not usually taught. **The maker space in which the class takes place provides resources including lab assistants, online training, public workshops, and step-by-step instructions posted on machines. As reflected in Table 1, statistically significant increases were observed in student experience for each of the skills supported by the course: hand tools, physical prototyping, power tools, postprocessing, CAD, and laser cutting. Two exceptions to this trend were electronics, which had a required, dedicated workshop, for the first time during this semester and did not yield significant experience gains; and laser cutting, where students reported significant experience gains despite the absence of a workshop. Team Collective Prototyping Experience Aggregate prototyping experience for each team can be derived from the surveys which allows analysis of group skill and contribution to the project (Table 2). Generally, considerable portions of the class had prior experience using hand tools, physical prototyping, power tools, and drawing and sketching but most were unfamiliar with manufacturing tools. Initial levels of experience with several other skills, such as 3D printing, varied across the teams. The tools directly taught in the course showed significant experience gains, which indicates the use of appropriate instructional methods. No teams demonstrated experience gains in 3D pen drawing except those who were trained in the tool as part of a separate experimental study. Table 2. Collective prototyping skill experience of teams. Critical Evaluation of Final Prototypes At the end of the semester the teams delivered final prototypes, which were evaluated based on their level of functionality across various design blocks and the tools/skills necessary to produce them. Additionally, each prototype was assessed on its level of fidelity and whether it performed the core function required to meet project goals. Team prototypes are depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Final prototypes of teams. Left to right, Team BM, Team HT, and Team NN. Teams constructed prototypes from a variety of materials. As can be seen in Table 3, the final prototypes exhibited a range of fidelity, skills used, and functionality. Table 3.

    "title": "Seroprevalence of anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Kenyan blood donors",
    "abstract": "Pandemic progress in Kenya By the end of July 2020, Kenya h ad reported only 341 deaths and \u223c20,000 cases of COVID-19. This is in marked contrast to the tens of thousands of deaths reported in many higher-income countries. The true extent of COVID-19 in the community was unknown and likely to be higher than reports indicated. Uyoga et al. found an overall seroprevalence among blood donors of 4.3%, peaking in 35- to 44-year-old individuals (see the Perspective by Maeda and Nkengasong). The low mortality can be partly explained by the steep demographics in Kenya, where less than 4% of the population is 65 or older. These circumstances combine to result in Kenyan hospitals not currently being overwhelmed by patients with respiratory distress. However, the imposition of a strict lockdown in this country has shifted the disease burden to maternal and child deaths as a result of disruption to essential medical services. Science, this issue p. 79; see also p. 27 By May 2020, 1 in 20 Kenyan adults had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, when fewer than 100 COVID-19 deaths had been reported nationally. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Africa is poorly described. The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Kenya was reported on 12 March 2020, and an overwhelming number of cases and deaths were expected, but by 31 July 2020, there were only 20,636 cases and 341 deaths. However, the extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the community remains unknown. We determined the prevalence of anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G among blood donors in Kenya in April\u2013June 2020. Crude seroprevalence was 5.6% (174 of 3098). Population-weighted, test-performance-adjusted national seroprevalence was 4.3% (95% confidence interval, 2.9 to 5.8%) and was highest in urban counties Mombasa (8.0%), Nairobi (7.3%), and Kisumu (5.5%). SARS-CoV-2 exposure is more extensive than indicated by case-based surveillance, and these results will help guide the pandemic response in Kenya and across Africa.",

    "title": "The 2020 Five Domains Model: Including Human\u2013Animal Interactions in Assessments of Animal Welfare",
    "abstract": "Simple Summary This review outlines the latest in a succession of updates of the Five Domains Model, which, at each stage, incorporated contemporary verified scientific thinking of relevance to animal welfare assessment. The current update includes, within the structure of the Model, specific guidance on how to evaluate the negative and/or positive impacts of human behaviour on animal welfare. Persons whose actions may be evaluated include, but are not limited to, livestock handlers, owners of draught animals, veterinary care staff, pound/shelter staff, zoo-keepers, wildlife managers, hunters, researchers, companion animal owners, owners of sport/recreational animals, animal trainers and service animal handlers. Situations where human\u2013animal interactions may have negative welfare impacts include: when animals have had little or no prior human contact, when human presence adds to already threatening circumstances, when human actions are directly unpleasant, threatening and/or noxious, when humans\u2019 prior actions are remembered as being aversive or noxious and when the actions of bonded humans cause unintended harms. In contrast, situations where human\u2013animal interactions may have positive welfare impacts include: when the companionable presence of humans provides company and feelings of safety, when humans provide preferred foods, tactile contacts and/or training reinforcements, when humans participate in enjoyable routine activities or in engaging variable activities, when the presence of familiar humans is calming in threatening circumstances and when humans act to end periods of deprivation, inhibition or harm. The explicit delineation within the Model of the potential impacts of human interactions on the welfare of animals enhances the Model\u2019s utility. Additional updates in this latest version are also explained. Abstract Throughout its 25-year history, the Five Domains Model for animal welfare assessment has been regularly updated to include at each stage the latest authenticated developments in animal welfare science thinking. The domains of the most up-to-date Model described here are: 1 Nutrition, 2 Physical Environment, 3 Health, 4 Behavioural Interactions and 5 Mental State. The first four domains focus attention on factors that give rise to specific negative or positive subjective experiences (affects), which contribute to the animal\u2019s mental state, as evaluated in Domain 5. More specifically, the first three domains focus mainly on factors that disturb or disrupt particular features of the body\u2019s internal stability. Each disturbed or disrupted feature generates sensory inputs which are processed by the brain to form specific negative affects, and these affects are associated with behaviours that act to restore the body\u2019s internal stability. As each such behaviour is essential for the survival of the animal, the affects associated with them are collectively referred to as \u201csurvival-critical affects\u201d. In contrast, Domain 4, now named Behavioural Interactions, focusses on evidence of animals consciously seeking specific goals when interacting behaviourally with (1) the environment, (2) other non-human animals and (3) as a new feature of the Model outlined here, humans. The associated affects, evaluated via Domain 5, are mainly generated by brain processing of sensory inputs elicited by external stimuli. The success of the animals\u2019 behavioural attempts to achieve their chosen goals is reflected in whether the associated affects are negative or positive. Collectively referred to as \u201csituation-related affects\u201d, these outcomes are understood to contribute to animals\u2019 perceptions of their external circumstances. These observations reveal a key distinction between the way survival-critical and situation-related affects influence animals\u2019 aligned behaviours. The former mainly reflect compelling motivations to engage in genetically embedded behavioural responses, whereas the latter mainly involve conscious behavioural choices which are the hallmarks of agency. Finally, numerous examples of human\u2013animal interactions and their attendant affects are described, and the qualitative grading of interactions that generate negative or positive affect is also illustrated.",

    "title": "Three Decades of Internet- and Computer-Based Interventions for the Treatment of Depression: Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Background Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Internet- and computer-based interventions (IBIs) have been shown to provide effective, scalable forms of treatment. More than 100 controlled trials and a growing number of meta-analyses published over the past 30 years have demonstrated the efficacy of IBIs in reducing symptoms in the short and long term. Despite the large body of research, no comprehensive review or meta-analysis has been conducted to date that evaluates how the effectiveness of IBIs has evolved over time. Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate whether there has been a change in the effectiveness of IBIs on the treatment of depression over the past 30 years and to identify potential variables moderating the effect size. Methods A sensitive search strategy will be executed across the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Data extraction and evaluation will be conducted by two independent researchers. Risk of bias will be assessed. A multilevel meta-regression model will be used to analyze the data and estimate effect size. Results The search was completed in mid-2019. We expect the results to be submitted for publication in early 2020. Conclusions The year 2020 will mark 30 years since the first paper was published on the use of IBIs for the treatment of depression. Despite the large and rapidly growing body of research in the field, evaluations of effectiveness to date are missing the temporal dimension. This review will address that gap and provide valuable analysis of how the effectiveness of interventions has evolved over the past three decades; which participant-, intervention-, and study-related variables moderate changes in effectiveness; and where research in the field may benefit from increased focus.

There are several previous literature review studies that analyzed the engineering design process in science education. However, we have not found any that investigates projects, discussed topics, as well as the benefits of the implementation of the engineering design process in science education. The research method used was a systematic literature review. This study analyzed the characteristics of the content based on year of publication, type of publications, countries that implement it, research approach, educational stage, and science content. The findings show that the projects used in the implementation of the engineering design processes in science education varied according to the discussed topics.

    "title": "Outbreak of COVID-19 - an urgent need for good science to silence our fears?",
    "abstract": "In the first two decades of the 21st century, we saw coronaviruses emerge across Asia, East and West. In 2002/3, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infected 238 and killed 33 in Singapore, including healthcare workers.(1) Ten years after that, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS or nCoV-2012) emerged in the Middle East and continues to appear with sporadic cases and localised outbreaks, including one in Korea.(2) Both these coronaviruses, thought to originate from bats, spilled over to civet cats and camels, respectively, and have caused significant human morbidity and mortality. While other human coronaviruses (HCoV) such as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 typically cause mild upper respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients, they can lead to pneumonia or cause exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or chronic heart failure, especially in older adults or the immunocompromised.(3) Animals are also not spared: swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (i.e. SADS-CoV) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (i.e. PEDV) have caused significant losses to the livestock industry in recent years.(3) It is thus not unexpected that a novel coronavirus made its appearance at the end of 2019. These RNA viruses with crown-like spikes on its envelope have been predicted to be emerging pathogens with outbreak potential because of their inherent propensity for rapid mutation and recombination due to their large genomes. Towards the end of December 2019, the health commission of Wuhan in Hubei province, central China, declared an outbreak of clusters of pneumonia in people, many of whom had visited the local seafood wholesale market in Wuhan. Within days, genome sequencing had indicated that this disease (now officially called COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019) was caused by a novel coronavirus (named SARS CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) that was closely related to a SARS-like coronavirus in bats with an extraordinarily high (96%) identity.(4) This work was done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, which had done a lot of research on bat coronaviruses.(5) Infected patients mostly presented with fever, cough and dyspnoea within 7\u201214 days of exposure to the infection; few had upper respiratory signs such as rhinorrhoea or gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea. Around a quarter of those affected, mostly the elderly with comorbidities, required intensive care support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure or co-infections.(6,7) The case fatality rate in the first published report of 99 cases from Wuhan was 11%,(7) while in contrast, the first comparable case series of patients with SARS from Hong Kong had a case fatality rate of only 2%. It is clearly too early to make comparisons between the two diseases in terms of case fatality. Differences in healthcare resources between the two cities may have had an impact on the outcomes. Travel within the global village, compounded by the peak of the Lunar New Year season, rapidly introduced COVID-19 to other Chinese provinces as well as to the rest of the world. While the majority of these cases initially had a positive travel history to Wuhan, or contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19, there was clear evidence of nosocomial spread in healthcare workers in Wuhan and elsewhere,(8) familial clustering outside Wuhan,(9) and local transmission in other countries in individuals who had not travelled to China. The reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.4\u20123.9), which meant that every individual who was taken ill could potentially transmit the infection to two or three more people.(10) Following the exponential increase in cases, both in China and exported, and the death toll, the World Health Organization declared this an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020. As the epidemic spread beyond China, predictable events in other countries, such as the first local transmissions and the first fatality, followed weeks behind their first occurrence in China. The indelible experiences of SARS and MERS, as well as concerns about avian and pandemic influenza, have fuelled pandemic preparedness efforts globally. Inevitably, imported cases of COVID-19 have reached the shores of Singapore and local transmission of COVID-19 has occurred. Fig. 1 illustrates a timeline of events since the outbreak began in China, globally and in Singapore. Singapore has adopted a proactive and multipronged approach, including broad entry restrictions for travellers from the entire mainland China; temperature screening at land, air and sea checkpoints; mandatory leave of absence for travellers within 14 days of their return from China; quarantine of contacts or those deemed to be in the incubation period; and public education on hand hygiene. The National Infection Prevention and Control Committee, National Public Health Laboratory, Ministry of Health Singapore and the brand-new, state-of-the-art National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) provide the scientific expertise to support policy decisions.

    "abstract": "Background: The role of aerosols in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains debated. We analysed an outbreak involving three non-associated families in Restaurant X in Guangzhou, China, and assessed the possibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and characterize the associated environmental conditions. Methods: We collected epidemiological data, obtained a video record and a patron seating-arrangement from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the suspected index patient. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer decay method. Results: Three families (A, B, C), 10 members of which were subsequently found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at this time, or previously, ate lunch at Restaurant X on Chinese New Year's Eve (January 24, 2020) at three neighboring tables. Subsequently, three members of family B and two members of family C became infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas none of the waiters or 68 patrons at the remaining 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the ventilation rate was 0.75-1.04 L/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was observed, aside from back-to-back sitting by some patrons. Our results show that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of exhaled virus-laden aerosols. Conclusions: Aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to poor ventilation may explain the community spread of COVID-19.",

    "title": "Do family investments explain growing socioeconomic disparities in children\u2019s reading, math, and science achievement during school versus summer months?",
    "abstract": "In the face of rising economic and social inequality, American parents increasingly seek to promote their children\u2019s academic achievement through provision of enriching learning opportunities. In this study, we hypothesized that parental investments in both home and out-of-home learning resources may partially explain socioeconomic disparities in children\u2019s academic skills, and may function differently during school versus summer months. Using data drawn from the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort of 2010\u20132011 (N \u2248 4,000), we assessed children\u2019s reading, math, and science skills from kindergarten entry through second grade, attending to how achievement gaps shifted during school versus summer months. Multilevel piecewise latent growth models identified significant, small socioeconomic status (SES) gaps in children\u2019s academic skills at kindergarten entry. These initial SES gaps remained stable for reading skills, grew during school months for science skills, and grew during summer months for math skills. Significant, small family SES disparities in home reading-based learning activities, out-of-home enrichment activities, TV/video time, and time in summer camps/child care programs also emerged, helping to explain growth in SES achievement gaps. Specifically, growing SES gaps in science skills appeared driven in part through school-year home learning activities and summer out-of-home enrichment activities. Growing SES gaps in math skills also functioned in part through summer out-of-home enrichment activities. Results suggest the importance of enhancing year-round investments across home, school, and community contexts to support the school success of economically disadvantaged children.

    "title": "Introduction to Forecasting the 2020 US Elections",
    "abstract": "................................................................................................................... The field of election forecasting has grown rapidly, especially since 2008, and its growth has accelerated in recent elections. The availability of more data, easily accessible data, and major statistical and methodological advances have all contributed to a surge in the number of news outlets, data journalists, and political scientists forecasting US elections. The increased interest in election forecasting is reflected in this year\u2019s symposium collection, which features 20 forecasts of presidential (both popular and Electoral College votes), House, and Senate elections.We selected these forecasts using a fast and fair process that started almost one year ago.We sent out an open call to the discipline inNovember 2019, inwhichwe specifically encouraged new forecasters and underrepresented groups to submit proposals. We received 22 submissions to be included in the symposium. At that stage, we decided to be as inclusive as possible and desk-rejected only a limited number of the initial submissions, mostly for being outside of the scope of the symposium. To blind-review each manuscript, we relied on a prearranged team of dedicated outside reviewers, and we also asked each author who submitted a proposal to act as a blind reviewer. Based on these quick and timely reviews, we accepted 15 articles including three critical reviews of the forecasting field. Without the quick turnaround by the authors and reviewers, this endeavor would have been impossible. These forecasts are rendered in an election year when predicting the outcome is more challenging than ever, in particular for models that rely on the fundamentals and are informed by historical patterns. As of September 2020, the COVID-19 virus has resulted in more than six million infections and more than 200,000 deaths in the United States alone (John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center 2020). This unprecedented pandemic is not only affecting everyday life in the United States but also policy priorities. In addition, social-distancing policies are forcing candidates, parties, and voter-mobilization organizations to rethink their campaign and mobilization practices. Government measures to slow down the spread of the virus have led to \u201cthe deepest global recession in decades\u201d (World Bank 2020). As the virus spread, the American economy cratered, resulting in negative economic growth and a spike in unemployment. Thus, the economic indicators that feature prominently in many political forecasting models are extreme outliers this year. This symposium addresses head on these challenges presented by the pandemic. For example, Abramowitz (2020) does not include the economy in his forecast model and Lewis-Beck and Tien (2020) argue for a lower limit in their economic indicators. There are other challenges to forecasting elections in 2020. First, historically, the American electorate swings between the Democratic and the Republican parties with some regularity, but extreme partisan polarization now reduces the number of potential swing voters. As a result, recent elections have been marked by smaller margins of victory than in the past (Abramowitz 2012). Second, the outcome of the 2016 presidential election has drawn attention to a daunting challenge for US election forecasters: the recent and recurring disconnect between the popular vote and the Electoral College vote. Many of the forecasts published in 2016\u2014much like public-opinion polls (as argued by Kennedy et al. 2018)\u2014 provided fairly accurate predictions of the two-party vote share. On average, the forecasts were only 1.6 percentage points off Clinton\u2019s vote share (Cuz\u00e1n 2020). Still, Trump\u2019s Electoral College win caught many by surprise because it occurred despite his losing the popular vote. In summary, a pandemic-induced recession, increasing party polarization, and a growing disconnect between the popular vote and the Electoral College vote all call on the field of forecasting to innovate. As the collection of articles in this symposium shows, forecasters are responding to these challenges. The forecasts in this collection rely on new indicators, data, and methods. Reflecting on the question, \u201cWhat should be predicted?,\u201d several models importantly choose to forecast the Electoral College vote for the first time. The end result is a collection of new and old forecasting models and forecasters who innovate theoretically and methodologically. A maturing field also needs to reflect on the value and usefulness of election forecasting. Three contributions in this symposium offer such a critical reflection by evaluating how political scientists historically performed as election forecasters (Cuz\u00e1n 2020), by thinking thoroughly about the role of predictions in political science (Dowding 2020), and by drawing attention to the risks as well as the opportunities of a forecasting exercise for the discipline (Victor 2020).",

    "abstract": "The year 2020 has seen an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic due to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus in 180 countries. In a desperate effort to discover new drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, many scientists are working around the clock. Their valuable time and effort may benefit from computer-based mining of a large volume of health science literature that is a treasure trove of information. In this paper, we have developed a graph-based model using abstracts of 10,683 scientific articles to find key information on three topics: transmission, drug types, and genome research related to coronavirus. A subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more topic-focused information. Within each subgraph, we use a betweenness centrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to drugs, diseases, pathogens, hosts of pathogens, and biomolecules. The results reveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Amantadine, Dexamethasone), pathogen-hosts (pigs, bats, macaque, cynomolgus), viral pathogens (zika, dengue, malaria, and several viruses in the coronaviridae virus family), and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms (oligonucleotide, interferon, glycoprotein) in connection with the core topic of coronavirus. The categorical summary of these keywords and topics may be a useful reference to expedite and recommend new and alternative directions for COVID-19 research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Background: Infectious disease-related public health emergencies (epidemics) may increase suicide risk, and high-quality evidence is needed to guide an international response. Aims: We investigated the potential impacts of epidemics on suicide-related outcomes. Method: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsyArXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv from inception to May 13\u201316, 2020. Inclusion criteria: primary studies, reviews, and meta-analyses; reporting the impact of epidemics; with a primary outcome of suicide, suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, and/or self-harm. Exclusion criteria: not concerned with suicide-related outcomes; not suitable for data extraction. PROSPERO registration: #CRD42020187013. Results: Eight primary papers were included, examining the effects of five epidemics on suicide-related outcomes. There was evidence of increased suicide rates among older adults during SARS and in the year following the epidemic (possibly motivated by social disconnectedness, fears of virus infection, and concern about burdening others) and associations between SARS/Ebola exposure and increased suicide attempts. A preprint study reported associations between COVID-19 distress and past-month suicidal ideation. Limitations: Few studies have investigated the topic; these are of relatively low methodological quality. Conclusion: Findings support an association between previous epidemics and increased risk of suicide-related outcomes. Research is needed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide outcomes.",

    "title": "Systematic Review of the Literature About the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Lives of School Children",
    "abstract": "Background: The year 2020 has been marked by the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus has reached many countries and has paralyzed the lives of many people who have been forced to stay at home in confinement. There have been many studies that have sought to analyze the impact of this pandemic from different perspectives; however, this study will pay attention to how it has affected and how it may affect children between 0 and 12 years in the future after the closure of schools for months. Objective: The objective of this article is to learn about the research carried out on the child population in times of confinement, especially those dealing with the psychological and motor aspects of minors. Methods: To carry out this systematic review, the PRISMA statement has been followed to achieve an adequate and organized structure of the manuscript. The bibliography has been searched in the Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, and Dialnet databases, using as keywords: \u201cCOVID-19\u201d and \u201cChildren.\u201d The criteria that were established for the selection of the articles were (1) articles focusing on an age of up to 12 years, (2) papers relating COVID-19 to children, and (3) studies analyzing the psychological and motor characteristics of children during confinement. Results: A total of nine manuscripts related to the psychological and motor factors in children under 12 have been found. The table presenting the results includes the authors, title, place of publication, and key ideas of the selected manuscripts. Conclusion: After concluding the systematic review, it has been detected that there are few studies that have focused their attention on the psychological, motor, or academic problems that can occur to minors after a situation of these characteristics. Similarly, a small number of studies have been found that promote actions at the family and school level to reverse this situation when life returns to normal. These results may be useful for future studies that seek to expand the information according to the evolution of the pandemic.",

    "title": "VHE gamma-ray detection of FSRQ QSO B1420+326 and modeling of its enhanced broadband state in 2020",
    "abstract": "Context. QSO B1420+326 is a blazar classified as a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ). At the beginning of the year 2020, it was found to be in an enhanced flux state and an extensive multiwavelength campaign allowed us to trace the evolution of the flare.\nAims. We search for very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from QSO B1420+326 during this flaring state. We aim to characterize and model the broadband emission of the source over different phases of the flare.\nMethods. The source was observed with a number of instruments in radio, near-infrared, optical (including polarimetry and spectroscopy), ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. We use dedicated optical spectroscopy results to estimate the accretion disk and the dust torus luminosity. We performed spectral energy distribution modeling in the framework of combined synchrotron-self-Compton and external Compton scenario in which the electron energy distribution is partially determined from acceleration and cooling processes.\nResults. During the enhanced state, the flux of both SED components of QSO B1420+326 drastically increased and the peaks were shifted to higher energies. Follow-up observations with the MAGIC telescopes led to the detection of VHE gamma-ray emission from this source, making it one of only a handful of FSRQs known in this energy range. Modeling allows us to constrain the evolution of the magnetic field and electron energy distribution in the emission region. The gamma-ray flare was accompanied by a rotation of the optical polarization vector during a low -polarization state. Also, a new superluminal radio knot contemporaneously appeared in the radio image of the jet. The optical spectroscopy shows a prominent FeII bump with flux evolving together with the continuum emission and a MgII line with varying equivalent width.",

    "abstract": "This special session furthers the work associated with SIGCSE Reads and the growing community of SIGCSE members who connect to each other through science fiction. The session starts with a practical experience addressing one of the five common goals presented previously: a learning experience for participants in how science fiction can be used in computing classrooms to teach ethics and develop CS students' facility for considering ethical situations with deeper critical thinking. Materials will be available so that the exercise can be translated to other classrooms. This will be followed by a significant Q & A session with one of this year's authors, Hugo Award winner David D. Levine, whose short story \"Damage\" addresses questions of ethical decision making by an AI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study brings together insights from the Science Education Initiative with a new course, \u201cSpy Novel Diplomacy: Propaganda and International Relations,\u201d which has been taught as a General Education Seminar for first year students. The class will continue on an annual basis from the spring semester of 2020 onward. Thus what follows is a combination of the Science Education Initiative with innovative teaching that incorporates literature. After an overview, work proceeds in five additional sections. The first section summarizes the Science Education Initiative and considers its potential for more expansive implementation. Ideas from that venture are identified for adoption in the new course on Spy Novel Diplomacy. The second section explores the potential value from works of fiction and visualization in the International Relations classroom. Section three introduces the new course on Spy Novel Diplomacy, connecting at a general level with innovative teaching techniques. Section four applies insights from the Science Education Initiative to the class in specific ways. The fifth and final section reflects on the Spy Novel Diplomacy course in relation to the Science Education Initiative, along with future directions in pedagogy.",

    "title": "Deep learning\u2014a first meta-survey of selected reviews across scientific disciplines, their commonalities, challenges and research impact",
    "abstract": "Deep learning belongs to the field of artificial intelligence, where machines perform tasks that typically require some kind of human intelligence. Deep learning tries to achieve this by drawing inspiration from the learning of a human brain. Similar to the basic structure of a brain, which consists of (billions of) neurons and connections between them, a deep learning algorithm consists of an artificial neural network, which resembles the biological brain structure. Mimicking the learning process of humans with their senses, deep learning networks are fed with (sensory) data, like texts, images, videos or sounds. These networks outperform the state-of-the-art methods in different tasks and, because of this, the whole field saw an exponential growth during the last years. This growth resulted in way over 10,000 publications per year in the last years. For example, the search engine PubMed alone, which covers only a sub-set of all publications in the medical field, provides already over 11,000 results in Q3 2020 for the search term \u2018deep learning\u2019, and around 90% of these results are from the last three years. Consequently, a complete overview over the field of deep learning is already impossible to obtain and, in the near future, it will potentially become difficult to obtain an overview over a subfield. However, there are several review articles about deep learning, which are focused on specific scientific fields or applications, for example deep learning advances in computer vision or in specific tasks like object detection. With these surveys as a foundation, the aim of this contribution is to provide a first high-level, categorized meta-survey of selected reviews on deep learning across different scientific disciplines and outline the research impact that they already have during a short period of time. The categories (computer vision, language processing, medical informatics and additional works) have been chosen according to the underlying data sources (image, language, medical, mixed). In addition, we review the common architectures, methods, pros, cons, evaluations, challenges and future directions for every sub-category.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to impact several aspects of our lives with its fast proliferation in many areas such as wearable devices, smart sensors and home appliances. IoT devices are characterized by their connectivity, pervasiveness and limited processing capability. The number of IoT devices in the world is increasing rapidly and it is expected that there will be 50 billion devices connected to the Internet by the end of the year 2020. This explosion of IoT devices, which can be easily increased compared to desktop computers, has led to a spike in IoT-based cyber-attack incidents. To alleviate this challenge, there is a requirement to develop new techniques for detecting attacks initiated from compromised IoT devices. Machine and deep learning techniques are in this context the most appropriate detective control approach against attacks generated from IoT devices. This study aims to present a comprehensive review of IoT systems-related technologies, protocols, architecture and threats emerging from compromised IoT devices along with providing an overview of intrusion detection models. This work also covers the analysis of various machine learning and deep learning-based techniques suitable to detect IoT systems related to cyber-attacks.",

    "abstract": ". This research is motivated by the learning conditions in Airmadidi State High School where there are weaknesses including: the learning process is still centered on the teacher as the main source of knowledge, where students do not dare to argue and some students do not pay attention to what is conveyed by the teacher. The objective to be achieved in this study is to improve student learning outcomes in photosynthesis material through the Learning Cycle learning model '5E' in class XII Science students at Airmadidi State High School in 2019/2020. This research is a classroom action research conducted at Airmadidi State High School with subjects of class XII science students. The object of research is the Learning Cycle '5E' on photosynthesis material. The research process was carried out in two cycles which included five stages, namely planning, implementation, observation, reflection, and evaluation. The data analysis technique used is a qualitative descriptive technique that is by analyzing student development data in the first cycle and second cycle is equipped with an average analysis of cognitive values, affective values, and psychomotor values of students. The results obtained showed that the average student learning outcomes in the first cycle, cognitive domain = 71,67 affective behavioral domain (very good); and psychomotor domain (very interested). Average student learning outcomes in cycle II, cognitive domain = 80.15 (successful) or increased from cycle I; affective domain (very good) or increased from the first cycle; psychomotor domain (very interested) or increase from cycle I. Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that the Learning Cycle '5E' learning model can improve the teaching and learning process, this is supported by an increase in Biology learning outcomes for students of class XII IPA SMA Negeri Airmadidi in the academic year 2019/2020.",

    "abstract": "Pandemic is a well-known term for the year 2020. It\u2019s essentially a disease that spreads across a region or the entire planet. The entire planet appears powerless, and a jerk triggered by a virus outbreak has halted. On 11 March 2020, WHO announced Corona Virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. The outbreak or epidemic of the virus differs widely from one nation to another. Society is the secret to solving the pandemic. Fever is one of the common, easily detectable symptoms of COVID-19. The COVID 19 in India is one of the most widespread pandemics caused by extreme acute corona viral syndrome2 (SARS-CoV-2) in coronvirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On 30 January 2020, the original case of COVID-19 in India, arising in China, was registered. India currently has the highest number of confirmed cases in Asia and the second largest number after the United States of America in the world, with a combined number of confirmed cases exceeding the thresholds of 100,000 on 19 May and 1.000,000 confirmed cases on 17 July 2020. The largest one-day increase in COVID-19 cases of 78,761 cases was observed in Indian countries on 29 August 2020, surpassing the previous record in US cases of 77,368 on 17 July 2020. Nowadays, data science tasks are not limited to traditional data analysis with limited attributes and records. In current scenarios, the real-time datasets are huge with enormous attributes and such datasets are very complex to evaluate using classical data analysis tools. For example, the datasets of the medical domain integrate several attributes in which the information of symptoms, diagnosis, travel history, health parameters, and many others are evaluated. To deal with such types of datasets assorted database query tools and programming languages are used.",

    "abstract": "For the system of education in many countries of the world, the end of the school year 2020 was disordered by the appearance of a new virus - COVID-19. A big number of people being infected, made it a necessity to use distance learning tools in the majority of educational institutions.\nIt is clear that for the younger age students according to their physiological and psychological development peculiarities, it is necessary to use all sense organs \u2013 seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling and touching in the process of learning. In practice it means that for the given category of children, for successful cognition of the world, it is necessary not only to see learning subjects, but also according to their possibilities to touch them, to smell them and to taste them. \nComplex understanding about the surrounding environment of a contemporary student is a combination of a real and virtual components of his life and activity. And, the more place virtual space occupies in a child\u2019s intellect, the more positive is seen the involvement of a real natural component in their cognition of the surrounding world. One has to combine and develop the work with the textbook, i.e., theoretical knowledge, with the practical abilities and skills of the younger age students in mastering natural science subjects. Therefore, thematic excursions, research works, activities in nature are very important for the younger age students.\nKnowing the surrounding world of one\u2019s own concrete place of living, a small part of the world, and establishing relationship between human and nature, a child acquires common understanding about the whole world. \nKeywords: educational process, distance teaching, science education, surrounding environment.",

    "title": "Algorithmic Profiling of Job Seekers in Austria: How Austerity Politics Are Made Effective",
    "abstract": "As of 2020, the Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) makes use of algorithmic profiling of job seekers to increase the efficiency of its counseling process and the effectiveness of active labor market programs. Based on a statistical model of job seekers' prospects on the labor market, the system\u2014that has become known as the AMS algorithm\u2014is designed to classify clients of the AMS into three categories: those with high chances to find a job within half a year, those with mediocre prospects on the job market, and those clients with a bad outlook of employment in the next 2 years. Depending on the category a particular job seeker is classified under, they will be offered differing support in (re)entering the labor market. Based in science and technology studies, critical data studies and research on fairness, accountability and transparency of algorithmic systems, this paper examines the inherent politics of the AMS algorithm. An in-depth analysis of relevant technical documentation and policy documents investigates crucial conceptual, technical, and social implications of the system. The analysis shows how the design of the algorithm is influenced by technical affordances, but also by social values, norms, and goals. A discussion of the tensions, challenges and possible biases that the system entails calls into question the objectivity and neutrality of data claims and of high hopes pinned on evidence-based decision-making. In this way, the paper sheds light on the coproduction of (semi)automated managerial practices in employment agencies and the framing of unemployment under austerity politics.",

    "title": "Long-term survival of children born with congenital anomalies: A systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies",
    "abstract": "Background Following a reduction in global child mortality due to communicable diseases, the relative contribution of congenital anomalies to child mortality is increasing. Although infant survival of children born with congenital anomalies has improved for many anomaly types in recent decades, there is less evidence on survival beyond infancy. We aimed to systematically review, summarise, and quantify the existing population-based data on long-term survival of individuals born with specific major congenital anomalies and examine the factors associated with survival. Methods and findings Seven electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ProQuest Natural, and Biological Science Collections), reference lists, and citations of the included articles for studies published 1 January 1995 to 30 April 2020 were searched. Screening for eligibility, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed in duplicate. We included original population-based studies that reported long-term survival (beyond 1 year of life) of children born with a major congenital anomaly with the follow-up starting from birth that were published in the English language as peer-reviewed papers. Studies on congenital heart defects (CHDs) were excluded because of a recent systematic review of population-based studies of CHD survival. Meta-analysis was performed to pool survival estimates, accounting for trends over time. Of 10,888 identified articles, 55 (n = 367,801 live births) met the inclusion criteria and were summarised narratively, 41 studies (n = 54,676) investigating eight congenital anomaly types (spina bifida [n = 7,422], encephalocele [n = 1,562], oesophageal atresia [n = 6,303], biliary atresia [n = 3,877], diaphragmatic hernia [n = 6,176], gastroschisis [n = 4,845], Down syndrome by presence of CHD [n = 22,317], and trisomy 18 [n = 2,174]) were included in the meta-analysis. These studies covered birth years from 1970 to 2015. Survival for children with spina bifida, oesophageal atresia, biliary atresia, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, and Down syndrome with an associated CHD has significantly improved over time, with the pooled odds ratios (ORs) of surviving per 10-year increase in birth year being OR = 1.34 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.24\u20131.46), OR = 1.50 (95% CI 1.38\u20131.62), OR = 1.62 (95% CI 1.28\u20132.05), OR = 1.57 (95% CI 1.37\u20131.81), OR = 1.24 (95% CI 1.02\u20131.5), and OR = 1.99 (95% CI 1.67\u20132.37), respectively (p < 0.001 for all, except for gastroschisis [p = 0.029]). There was no observed improvement for children with encephalocele (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.95\u20131.01, p = 0.19) and children with biliary atresia surviving with native liver (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.88\u20131.03, p = 0.26). The presence of additional structural anomalies, low birth weight, and earlier year of birth were the most commonly reported predictors of reduced survival for any congenital anomaly type. The main limitation of the meta-analysis was the small number of studies and the small size of the cohorts, which limited the predictive capabilities of the models resulting in wide confidence intervals. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis summarises estimates of long-term survival associated with major congenital anomalies. We report a significant improvement in survival of children with specific congenital anomalies over the last few decades and predict survival estimates up to 20 years of age for those born in 2020. This information is important for the planning and delivery of specialised medical, social, and education services and for counselling affected families. This trial was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42017074675).",

    "abstract": "Two consecutive dry years, 2018 and 2019, a warm winter in 2019/20, and a very dry spring in 2020 led to the development of severe drought in Poland. In this paper, changes in the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for the interval from 1971 to the end of May 2020 are examined. The values of SPEI (based on 12, 24 and 30 month windows, i.e., SPEI 12, SPEI 24 and SPEI 30) were calculated with the help of the Penman\u2013Monteith equation. Changes in soil moisture contents were also examined from January 2000 to May 2020, based on data from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center, presenting increasing water shortages in a central belt of Poland. The study showed that the 2020 spring drought was among the most severe events in the analyzed period and presented decreasing trends of SPEI at most stations located in central Poland. This study also determined changes in soil moisture contents from January 2000 to May 2020 that indicate a decreasing tendency. Cumulative water shortages from year to year led to the development of severe drought in the spring of 2020, as reflected in very low SPEI values and low soil moisture.",

    "title": "The ELFIN Mission",
    "abstract": "The Electron Loss and Fields Investigation with a Spatio-Temporal Ambiguity-Resolving option (ELFIN-STAR, or heretoforth simply: ELFIN) mission comprises two identical 3-Unit (3U) CubeSats on a polar (\u223c93 \u2218 inclination), nearly circular, low-Earth (\u223c450\u00a0km altitude) orbit. Launched on September 15, 2018, ELFIN is expected to have a >2.5 year lifetime. Its primary science objective is to resolve the mechanism of storm-time relativistic electron precipitation, for which electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are a prime candidate. From its ionospheric vantage point, ELFIN uses its unique pitch-angle-resolving capability to determine whether measured relativistic electron pitch-angle and energy spectra within the loss cone bear the characteristic signatures of scattering by EMIC waves or whether such scattering may be due to other processes. Pairing identical ELFIN satellites with slowly-variable along-track separation allows disambiguation of spatial and temporal evolution of the precipitation over minutes-to-tens-of-minutes timescales, faster than the orbit period of a single low-altitude satellite (T orbit \u223c 90\u00a0min). Each satellite carries an energetic particle detector for electrons (EPDE) that measures 50\u00a0keV to 5\u00a0MeV electrons with \u0394 $\\Delta $ E/E < 40% and a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) on a \u223c72\u00a0cm boom that measures magnetic field waves (e.g., EMIC waves) in the range from DC to 5\u00a0Hz Nyquist (nominally) with <0.3\u00a0nT/sqrt(Hz) noise at 1\u00a0Hz. The spinning satellites (T spin \u223c $\\,\\sim $ 3\u00a0s) are equipped with magnetorquers (air coils) that permit spin-up or -down and reorientation maneuvers. Using those, the spin axis is placed normal to the orbit plane (nominally), allowing full pitch-angle resolution twice per spin. An energetic particle detector for ions (EPDI) measures 250\u00a0keV \u2013 5\u00a0MeV ions, addressing secondary science. Funded initially by CalSpace and the University Nanosat Program, ELFIN was selected for flight with joint support from NSF and NASA between 2014 and 2018 and launched by the ELaNa XVIII program on a Delta II rocket (with IceSatII as the primary). Mission operations are currently funded by NASA. Working under experienced UCLA mentors, with advice from The Aerospace Corporation and NASA personnel, more than 250 undergraduates have matured the ELFIN implementation strategy; developed the instruments, satellite, and ground systems and operate the two satellites. ELFIN\u2019s already high potential for cutting-edge science return is compounded by concurrent equatorial Heliophysics missions (THEMIS, Arase, Van Allen Probes, MMS) and ground stations. ELFIN\u2019s integrated data analysis approach, rapid dissemination strategies via the SPace Environment Data Analysis System (SPEDAS), and data coordination with the Heliophysics/Geospace System Observatory (H/GSO) optimize science yield, enabling the widest community benefits. Several storm-time events have already been captured and are presented herein to demonstrate ELFIN\u2019s data analysis methods and potential. These form the basis of on-going studies to resolve the primary mission science objective. Broad energy precipitation events, precipitation bands, and microbursts, clearly seen both at dawn and dusk, extend from tens of keV to >1\u00a0MeV. This broad energy range of precipitation indicates that multiple waves are providing scattering concurrently. Many observed events show significant backscattered fluxes, which in the past were hard to resolve by equatorial spacecraft or non-pitch-angle-resolving ionospheric missions. These observations suggest that the ionosphere plays a significant role in modifying magnetospheric electron fluxes and wave-particle interactions. Routine data captures starting in February 2020 and lasting for at least another year, approximately the remainder of the mission lifetime, are expected to provide a very rich dataset to address questions even beyond the primary mission science objective.",

    "title": "Tuberculosis in the Western Pacific Region: Estimating the Burden of Disease and Return on Investment 2020-2030",
    "abstract": "Background: We aimed to estimate the disease burden of Tuberculosis (TB) and return on investment of TB care in the Western Pacific Region (WPR) until 2030. \n \nMethods: We projected the TB epidemic in Viet Nam and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR) for the years 2020-30 with TIME Impact model under various scenarios: no TB care; baseline (TB care continues at current levels); and several interventions. We extracted literature results for China and the Philippines to estimate region-level incidence and deaths. We used a Solow model to estimate the return on investment of TB care and interventions. \n \nFindings: In the baseline scenario, TB incidence in the WPR decreased from 95\u00b72/100,000/year (2019) to 91\u00b75/100,000/year (2030), and TB deaths from 79,000/year (2019) to 68,100/year (2030). Active case finding (ACF) strategies (screening people not seeking care for respiratory symptoms) were the most effective single intervention. A combination intervention resulted in TB incidence of 43\u00b79/100,000/year and 18,000 TB deaths in 2030. Estimated return on investment (2020-2030) for TB care in Viet Nam and Lao PDR ranged US$4 to US$49 per dollar spent, Additional interventions brought returns of up to US$2\u00b77 per dollar spent. \n \nInterpretation: TB incidence will only modestly decrease in the WPR without additional interventions. Intervention strategies that include ACF can reduce TB burden, but achieving the End TB incidence and mortality targets will be difficult without new transformational tools. TB care can bring a multiple-fold return on investment. \n \nFunding Statement: This study was funded by the World Health Organization Western Pacific Regional Office and the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant 163878). \n \nDeclaration of Interests: We declare no competing interests.",

As a result, we are confident that our ongoing ambition to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborative science and efficient impactful research will continue to be prosperous. The key performance indicators for Advanced Science illustrate that our way towards Open Research is going in the right direction. Submissions increased by more than 60% and the number of published papers increased by more than 35% compared to the previous year (both values at the time of writing 2019). The impact factor raised to a record value of currently 15.804, which represents an increase of 27% compared to 2018. Overall the number of downloaded articles nearly doubled within the last 12 months. Figure 1 shows this continuing and lasting trend in a striking way. On the occasion of our 5th anniversary in 2019, we invited our executive advisory board members to contribute articles for a celebratory series to be published in a continuously expanding virtual issue (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ toc/10.1002/(ISSN)2198-3844.AnniversaryVirtualIssue). These articles showcase outstanding achievements of leading international researchers in the field of materials science, physics and chemistry, medical and life sciences, as well as engineering. In case you are interested in getting to know our executive advisory board members on a more personal level, I would like In conversations with our readers and authors, we have been noticing an increasing demand for Open Research for several years. This demand is further intensified by requests of funding organizations as well as politics. Open Research is a very broad term that covers various aspects of science becoming more open, accessible, efficient, democratic, and transparent, as defined by the European Commission. Certainly, publishers and journals play an essential role in this process. We do not only consider Advanced Science at the forefront of this development, but we are also committed to further boost this process. Manuscripts published in an Open Access-journal such as Advanced Science are accessible to everyone anywhere at any time. They are easy to find on our journal-website as well as in all important indexing services (e.g., PubMedCentral, Web of Knowledge etc.). Publishing under a CC-BY license accelerates and simplifies communication. Furthermore, we accept submission of papers published on preprint-servers in order to improve rapid research availability and transparency. The visibility of your results can be further enhanced by ordering a Video Abstract (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/ journal/21983844/homepage/video-abstract-gallery.html) or promotion in various social networks. The exceptional quality of our publications is guaranteed by a fast, rigorous and strict peer-review process. Starting in 2020, our referees will have the option to receive",

    "title": "Twelve Recommendations for Advancing Marine Conservation in European and Contiguous Seas",
    "abstract": "Like most ocean regions today, the European and contiguous seas experience cumulative impacts from local human activities and global pressures. They are largely in poor environmental condition with deteriorating trends. Despite several success stories, European policies for marine conservation fall short of being effective. Acknowledging the challenges for marine conservation, a 4-year multi-national network, MarCons, supported collaborative marine conservation efforts to bridge the gap between science, management and policy, aiming to contribute in reversing present negative trends. By consolidating a large network of more than 100 scientists from 26 countries, and conducting a series of workshops over 4 years (2016\u20132020), MarCons analyzed challenges, opportunities and obstacles for advancing marine conservation in the European and contiguous seas. Here, we synthesize the major issues that emerged from this analysis and make 12 key recommendations for policy makers, marine managers, and researchers. To increase the effectiveness of marine conservation planning, we recommend (1) designing coherent networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the framework of marine spatial planning (MSP) and applying systematic conservation planning principles, including re-evaluation of existing management zones, (2) designing MPA networks within a broader transboundary planning framework, and (3) implementing integrated land-freshwater-sea approaches. To address inadequate or poorly informed management, we recommend (4) developing and implementing adaptive management plans in all sites of the Natura 2000 European conservation network and revising the Natura 2000 framework, (5) embedding and implementing cumulative effects assessments into a risk management process and making them operational, and (6) promoting actions to reach \u2018good environmental status\u2019 in all European waters. To account for global change in conservation planning and management, we further recommend (7) developing conservation strategies to address the impacts of global change, for example identifying climate-change refugia as high priority conservation areas, and (8) incorporating biological invasions in conservation plans and prioritizing management actions to control invasive species. Finally, to improve current practices that may compromise the effectiveness of conservation actions, we recommend (9) reinforcing the collection of high-quality open-access data, (10) improving mechanisms for public participation in MPA planning and management, (11) prioritizing conservation goals in full collaboration with stakeholders, and (12) addressing gender inequality in marine sciences and conservation.",

The conference is organized by the Polytechnic Institute of the Yaroslav-the-Wise Novgorod State University. ISPCIET\u20192020 was held in person, but the reports of several participants were presented online due to the epidemiological situation caused by COVID-19. The interaction of these participants with the rest of the conference attendees was facilitated through Zoom. Immediately after the report was presented, the listeners were given the opportunity to ask the speaker a question online and take part in the discussion on the topic of the report. They also had the opportunity to contact the authors of the reports after the conference through the organizing committee or by email. The plenary session was broadcast online for all of the participants and guests of the conference. The conference was attended by 103 people, including 69 online-participants: scientists from universities in Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, China, the Netherlands, USA, Uzbekistan, Ukraine. Despite the difference in time zones and a difficult epidemiological situation, there were no setbacks in the conference, the communication of speakers and conference participants went as usual. The conference organizers express their sincere gratitude to all participants and hope that the Innovations in Engineering and Technology conference will become a permanent platform for discussing innovative technologies in the development of convergent solutions in engineering, technology and cross-industry scientific research.

    "abstract": "This is the 15th edition of IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST). Begun in 2006 as an IEEE Symposium at VIS, it is now in its 11th year as an IEEE Conference. It continues to be the leading forum for Visual Analytics research, defined as the science of analytical reasoning supported by interactive visual interfaces. VAST represents research pushing the boundaries of the state of the art in theory and foundations of visual data analysis, techniques and algorithms, empirical and design studies, as well as systems and applications. VAST in 2020 continues to feature its successful conference paper track, in addition to the TVCG paper track. The goal of this track is to increase the diversity of Visual Analytics applications and to better support participation of interdisciplinary researchers. It provides innovative advances and applications in Visual Analytics. The VAST 2020 Program Committee comprised 59 senior experts from the field. 210 complete submissions entered the two-stage review cycle, from which VAST eventually accepted 51 papers for the TVCG track, and 10 for the conference track. The conference track papers are published as part of the VIS USB proceedings, and submitted to the IEEE Digital Library for archival publishing. The accepted papers contribute interesting, timely ideas and results to the VAST 2020 conference sessions on Fairness and AI, Interactive Machine Learning, Text Analysis, Graphs, Evaluation and Theory, as well as Applications. Now in its 15th year, the IEEE VAST Challenge continues to pose new challenges to the visual analytics research community to encourage innovation in interactive visual representation, data transformation, and analytical reasoning. This year\u2019s three minichallenges centered around a global internet outage, and tested participants\u2019 abilities to explore and compare graphs, draw conclusions from poorly classified images, and to design a future visual analytic environment. The datasets and submissions are archived in the Visual Analytics Benchmark Repository (https://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/varepository/), and papers for several submissions are published as part of the VIS USB proceedings. This year\u2019s submissions illustrate the power of combining machine learning and interactive visualization to gain insight into complex problems.",

    "abstract": "Background Croatia has closed all educational institutions after 32 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were confirmed and switched to exclusive e-learning. Health sciences university students may have been particularly affected with this change due to a lack of practical education. It is not known how health sciences students and schools have adjusted to exclusive e-learning. This study aimed to explore attitudes and concerns of health sciences students in Croatia regarding the complete switch to e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Eligible participants were students from 9 institutions offering university-level health sciences education in Croatia enrolled in the academic year 2019/2010, and participating in e-learning. Data were collected with a questionnaire distributed via email during April/May 2020. Results A total of 2520 students (aged 25.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7\u2009years) responded to the questionnaire (70.3% response rate). General satisfaction with exclusive e-learning was rated with average grade of 3.7 out of 5. Compared with previous education, exclusive e-learning was rated with average grade of 3.2 out of 5. Compared to classroom learning, equal or higher motivation to attend exclusive e-learning was reported by 64.4% of participants. With a longer duration of exclusive e-learning, equal or higher motivation was reported by 65.5% of participants. Less than half of the students indicated they felt deprived or concerned due to the lack of practical lessons. Most participants indicated that in the future, they would prefer to combine classic classroom and e-learning ( N \u2009=\u20091403; 55.7%). Conclusions Most health sciences students were satisfied with the exclusive e-learning, as well as their personal and institutional adjustment to it. Students\u2019 feedback can help institutions to improve the exclusive e-learning experience for students in the time of the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging contaminant ubiquitous in the environment. There is growing concern regarding potential human health effects, a major human exposure route being dietary uptake. We have undertaken a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis to identify all relevant research on MP contamination of salt intended for human consumption. Three thousand nine hundred and nineteen papers were identified, with ten fitting the inclusion criteria. A search of the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science, from launch date to September 2020, was conducted. MP contamination of salt varied significantly between four origins, sea salt 0\u20131674 MPs/kg, lake salt 8\u2013462 MPs/kg, rock and well salt 0\u2013204 MPs/kg. The majority of samples were found to be contaminated by MPs. Corresponding potential human exposures are estimated to be 0\u20136110 MPs per year (for all origins), confirming salt as a carrier of MPs. A bespoke risk of bias (RoB) assessment tool was used to appraise the quality of the studies, with studies demonstrating moderate to low RoB. These results suggest that a series of recurring issues need to be addressed in future research regarding sampling, analysis and reporting to improve confidence in research findings.",

    "title": "Letter to the Editor\u2014Moving Beyond a Lost Cause: Forensic Anthropology and Ancestry Estimates in the United States",
    "abstract": "Editor, Historians of the 21st century will examine the year 2020 and the confluence of seismic events which impacted everyday life in the United States and served to highlight systemic inequalities that have permeated the nation for centuries. Between the devastating COVID-19 pandemic and the homicides of numerous Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement officials, we have all been reminded about the fragility of life, and the failures of our society to live up to the ideals enshrined in the foundational documents which established the United States of America over two centuries ago. Tackling these failures seems overwhelming at times; however, changes can be enacted with candid and reflexive discussions about the status quo. In writing this letter, we direct our comments to the forensic anthropology community in the United States in hopes of sparking a discussion about the long-standing practice of ancestry estimation and changes that are frankly long overdue. Herein, we argue two primary points: (i) we urge an immediate moratorium on the use of morphoscopic cranial traits in the estimation of ancestry given the lack of comprehensive inquiry into why the traits exist and the fact that their use serves to bolster the debunked biological race concept; and (ii) we issue a call to action for forensic anthropologists to scrutinize the way that ancestry estimates in forensic anthropology reports might hinder identification efforts. Starting with the modernization of forensic anthropology in the mid-twentieth century, the estimation of ancestry has figured prominently in our methodological toolkit. It has been accepted as fact that estimates of \u201crace,\u201d \u201cancestry,\u201d \u201cpopulation affinity,\u201d or \u201cbioaffinity\u201d (hereafter ancestry) are compulsory for the process of human identification, in concert with other parameters such as age-at-death to include or exclude possible missing persons in cases when unidentified human remains are recovered. However, at this moment in the histories of our discipline and our country, it is time to rethink the forensic anthropological canon and critically evaluate why we have relied on traits that we do not understand. Indeed, morphoscopic traits may best be viewed through a historical lens that signal a time when many leading anthropologists believed that Homo sapiens could be winnowed into a small number of discrete groups. Ultimately, it is our firm opinion that morphoscopic traits are forensic anthropology\u2019s Lost Cause and it is time for our field to abandon the fac ade of their importance and utility. Today, forensic anthropologists hold that estimating ancestry which includes the use of morphoscopic traits and craniometric distances is possible because variables related to worldwide human variation are reflected in the skeleton and are ultimately linked to heritability (1,2). However, herein lies the problem: The skeletal nonmetric traits which for decades have been studied by biological anthropologists and population geneticists are not the morphoscopic traits utilized by forensic anthropologists to generate estimates of an unknown decedent\u2019s ancestry. Practitioners of forensic anthropology have glossed over this point and have not only failed to explicitly recognize that the heritability of morphoscopic traits remains unknown, but a similarly egregious transgression is the failure to initiate lines of empirical inquiry into this question. The former is a problem because of the faulty logic inherent in the assumption that these traits have classificatory power when we do not understand important details such as how and why a person inherited the traits from their ancestors; the latter is particularly telling and highlights the inextricable nature of the science we practice and the society in which we were enculturated\u2014namely, one where the reality of social race hierarchies and differences dictates part of our worldview. Indeed, the fact that we have arrived at a point where we could formulate these opinions is a result of the confluence of our unique lived experiences in this particular time and place. It may be that the intention of proponents of morphoscopic traits is not to imply anything about heritability given one recent definition (e.g., \u201cquasicontinuous variables of the cranium that can be reflected as soft-tissue differences [emphasis ours] in the living\u201d [3]); however, trait application has not been satisfactorily uncoupled from the blatantly typological approach, thoroughly debunked by biological anthropologists going back decades. In this way, part of contemporary forensic anthropological practice is a throwback to an earlier time when ideas about biological determinism and essentialist aspects of the races were taken as gospel truths and used to justify racialized hierarchies leading to both overt and covert structural inequities which continue today. Moreover, studies including morphoscopic traits such as the \u201cpost-bregmatic depression\u201d or \u201cnasal bone contour\u201d have not provided a suitable explanation as to why varying constellations of morphoscopic traits such as these have classificatory power that correspond with common socially recognized labels related to ancestry or ethnicity. The idea that morphoscopic traits can adequately be used to place decedents into discrete groups has been perpetuated in the pages of this journal without any deliberate appraisal of the underlying assumption that a finite number of groups exist; or critically, acknowledgement of the harm of connecting social race to skeletal traits insofar that it only serves to sustain the falsified biological race concept and misinforms the public, to include law enforcement and the medicolegal community, about human variation. Of further major concern is that studies involving these traits have generally not been conducted through the lenses of evolutionary theory or ecogeographic variation, foundational theories for biological anthropology. Indeed, every other parameter commonly evaluated by forensic anthropologists is grounded in an explanatory framework that ties back to particular accepted bodies of knowledge (4). Rather, when it comes to morphoscopic traits in particular, typology appears to be the only theoretical framework in attendance. Taken together, these failures are frankly unacceptable and underscore why this approach should be removed from everyday forensic anthropological practice. Just as troubling as the scientific and social issues raised by the use of morphoscopic traits are overall ancestry estimates. As discussed, most forensic anthropologists operate under an explicit assumption that ancestry is a critical part of the biological profile. Along with other estimated parameters, we produce an Received 24 June 2020; accepted 25 June 2020.",

    "title": "IEEE NANO 2020 The 20th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology",
    "abstract": "The IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE NANO) is sponsored by the IEEE Nanotechnology Council (NTC) and rotates between Regions 1-7 & 9 (North and South America,) Region 8 (Europe, Africa and the Middle East,) and Region 10 (Asia and Australasia) \u2026.. normally! But we don\u2019t have to tell you that this year has been anything but normal. NANO 2020 was scheduled to be held in Montreal, but the NTC Conference Committee bowed to the inevitable on April 21 st and decided, at a time of great uncertainty and conflicting information whether travel bans would be lifted and whether the pandemic would be recognized as a force majeure for insurance purposes, to postpone the physical conference in Montreal until 2021 and to take NANO 2020 virtual. This is the same decision that was made by the vast majority of research conferences worldwide, but many of these simply put recorded presentations online, whereas the new NANO 2020 committee was determined to retain as much of the feel of a traditional face-to-face conference as possible, primarily by the preservation of chaired sessions with live Q&A. Of course, that presented the very real problem, with no completely satisfactory solution, of how to accommodate time zones worldwide. The team has done the best we could in this regard, but inevitably some compromises had to be made, and we hope the final program schedule allows each attendee to participate in most of the sessions of interest. Of course, the pre-recorded presentations are available before, during, and after the conference itself, so there should be no issue with session conflicts, and furthermore all Q&A\u2019s will be recorded for the benefit of those who missed them live. The one-hour panel will consist of the NTC Past-Presidents and NANO Conference Chairs . In the informal atmosphere, the Past-Presidents and NANO Chairs will share their leadership experiences, funny and horror stories, their projections and expectations for nanotechnology, and advices for young professionals in the field of nanotechnology. The panel aims to have an open conversation about career trajectories, potential challenges faced by women engineers and key skills that our panelists have found beneficial in their personal experience. We will also discuss the role of mentoring in corporate and academic life, ways to find inspiring mentors and even using IEEE as a platform to collaborate and network. Abstract With 5G in full deployment, first white papers and articles on 6G are already appearing, showing how the industry needs are driving fast towards more, faster, and more intelligent connectivity. Ten times higher data rates than 5G (>100Gbps), extreme low power and low latency, instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) empowered networks, massive coverage and new ideas on how to connect with devices and even our brain are only a few of the concepts that are being considered for 6G. But are we ready to take the next leap? And what innovations at the technology side would be needed to realize this exciting vision of an intelligently connected world? In this talk, we will focus on the technology challenges to enable next generations of wireless communication, 5G and 6G, and how compound semiconductor devices could play a key role in enabling ultra-fast, reliable and power-efficient connectivity. Abstract The search for a digital switch that is more energy-efficient than a transistor and hence more amenable to prolonging Moore\u2019s law has recently lead to the notion of a bistable nanomagnetic device that is switched between two stable magnetization states with electrically generated mechanical strain. Logic gates (inverters, Bennett clocked gates, etc.) and memory, predicated on this technology, have been demonstrated in our group. While they indeed dissipate very little energy to operate, their drawback is the high switching error probability which hinders their applications in Boolean computing. They can, however, still be used in applications that are more forgiving of switching errors, e.g. probabilistic (non-Boolean) computing, analog arithmetic circuits, belief networks, artificial neurons, restricted Boltzmann machines, image processors, and ternary content addressable memory. Additionally, they can also be used for non-computing devices such as microwave oscillators that perform better than traditional spin torque nano-oscillators, and even extreme sub-wavelength acoustic and electromagnetic antennas whose radiation efficiencies are relatively unencumbered by their extreme sub-wavelength dimensions. This talk will describe some of these advances. This work has been supported by the US National Science Foundation under grants ECCS-1124714, CCF-1216614, ECCS-1609303 and CCF-1815303, by the State of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University. Some of this work was carried out in collaboration with Prof. Jayasimha Atulasimha of Virginia Commonwealth University and Prof. Amit Ranjan Trivedi of the Illinois at Abstract Phonons, the quasi-particles carriers of heat and sound, are involved in practically all kind of mechanical, optical, and thermal phenomena. Using modern nano and microfabrication techniques, phonons can be engineered to interact resonantly with photons to reveal new properties with potential impact on society. This is the case of radiative cooling, which involves decreasing the temperature of a body by emitting infrared radiation, without using electricity or any other kind of extra energy input. Radiative cooling technologies constitute attractive solutions to reduce the intensive electricity consumption of modern cooling technologies, and they are of particular interest in views of the increasing cooling needs due to global warming. In this talk, we will provide an introduction to the state-of-the art and a detailed summary of recent progress in this research field. The recent work in our institute on self-assembled 2D thermofuctional materials will be presented and remaining questions and challenges for real-world applications will be discussed. The major achievements will be summarised and trends in nanophononics and nanophotonics relevant to passive cooling illustrated. Finally, an insight into the possibilities of using these emerging technologies at very-large scale will be given, where they could have a very positive environmental impact. management that can significantly reduce the current high energy footprint of thermoregulation new passive systems that make use of non-toxic materials, while developing further understanding on thermal energy transport via surface phonon polaritons. on engineering, transfer tailoring physical properties of controlling transport within Abstract In 1982 two papers in particular were published. One is recognized as the bible of Silicon micromachining, which is a typical top-down approach to miniaturization, and the other is known as the origin of DNA nanotechnology, which is a typical bottom-up approach to realizing nanoscale objects. Almost 40 years later the former is still the key to MEMS and the latter is the key to molecular machines. Both of these are recognized as powerful technologies and yet there remains a significant gap between them. world at micro and Abstract The talk focuses on the development of droplet microfluidic-based molecular tests for pathogen identification (ID) and phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). First, I will talk about the \u201cdroplet magnetofluidics\u201d technology that eliminates the need for large, complex instrumentation and fluidics typically associated with clinical laboratory nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). We have demonstrated that droplet magnetofluidics facilitates streamlined capturing and purification of nucleic acids from clinical samples for PCR detection in a USB disk-sized cartridge with a turn-around time of < 30 min. Automated transport of the nucleic acids captured on magnetic particles through discrete droplets of reagents within the cartridge provides integration of sample preparation and nucleic acid detection. Our recently developed platforms have demonstrated clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity for Hepatitis C viral tests from patient blood and detection of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) from self-collected vaginal and urethral swab samples. Meanwhile, I will also introduce a rapid and integrated single-cell biosensing platform, termed dropFAST, for bacterial growth detection and antimicrobial susceptibility assessment. DropFAST utilizes a rapid resazurin-based fluorescent growth assay coupled with stochastic confinement of bacteria in 20 pL droplets to detect signal from growing bacteria after 1 h incubation, equivalent to 2\u20133 bacterial replications. Full integration of droplet generation, incubation, and detection into a single, uninterrupted stream also renders this platform uniquely suitable for in-line bacterial phenotypic growth assessment. To illustrate the concept of rapid digital antimicrobial susceptibility assessment, we employ the dropFAST platform for rapid AST of various pathogens associated with urinary tract infections (UTI) directly using urine samples. Abstract Advances in plasma process technology have contributed directly to advances in the miniaturization and integration of semiconductor devices. However, in semiconductor devices that encroach on the nanoscale domain, defects or damage can be caused by charged particles and ultraviolet rays emitted from the plasma, severely impairing the characteristics of nano-devices that have a larger surface than bulk areas. It is therefore essential to develop a method for suppressing or controlling charge accumulation and ultraviolet damage in plasma processing. The neutral beam process developed by the authors is a method that suppresses the formation of defects at the atomic layer level in the processed surface, allowing ideal surface chemical reactions to take place at room tempe",

    "abstract": "Purpose Cancer rates are exponentially increasing worldwide and over 15 million new cases are expected in the year 2020 according to the World Cancer Report. To support the clinical diagnosis of the disease, recent technical advancements in digital microscopy have been achieved to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of the process. Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) has issued the guidelines, in particular, the development of digital whole slide image scanning system. It is very helpful to the computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer. Methods Whole slide imaging supported by fluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and multispectral imaging concepts. Due to the high dimension of WSI images and computation, it is a challenging task to find the region of interest (ROI) on a malignant sample image. The unsupervised machine learning and quantitative analysis of malignant sample images are supported by morphological features and shape formulas to find the correct region of interest. Due to computational limitations, it starts to work on small patches, integrate the results, and automated localize or detect the ROI. It is also compared to the handcrafted and automated region of interest provided in the ICIAR2018 dataset. Results A total of 10 hematoxylins and eosin (H&E) stained malignant breast histology microscopy whole slide image samples are labeled and annotated by two medical experts who are team members of the ICIAR 2018 challenge. After applying the proposed methodology, it is successfully able to localize the malignant patches of WSI sample images and getting the ROI with an average accuracy of 85.5%. Conclusion With the help of the k-means clustering algorithm, morphological features, and shape formula, it is possible to recognize the region of interest using the whole slide imaging concept.",

    "title": "Role of biological Data Mining and Machine Learning Techniques in Detecting and Diagnosing the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that are common in many animal species, including camels, cattle, cats and bats. Animal CoVs, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2, rarely infect and spread among humans. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of the resulting disease from this new CoV called \u2018COVID-19\u2019, as a \u2018public health emergency of international concern\u2019. This global pandemic has affected almost the whole planet and caused the death of more than 315,131 patients as of the date of this article. In this context, publishers, journals and researchers are urged to research different domains and stop the spread of this deadly virus. The increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications has addressed several medical problems. However, such applications remain insufficient given the high potential threat posed by this virus to global public health. This systematic review addresses automated AI applications based on data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19. We aimed to obtain an overview of this critical virus, address the limitations of utilising data mining and ML algorithms, and provide the health sector with the benefits of this technique. We used five databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus and performed three sequences of search queries between 2010 and 2020. Accurate exclusion criteria and selection strategy were applied to screen the obtained 1305 articles. Only eight articles were fully evaluated and included in this review, and this number only emphasised the insufficiency of research in this important area. After analysing all included studies, the results were distributed following the year of publication and the commonly used data mining and ML algorithms. The results found in all papers were discussed to find the gaps in all reviewed papers. Characteristics, such as motivations, challenges, limitations, recommendations, case studies, and features and classes used, were analysed in detail. This study reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques for CoV prediction algorithms based on data mining and ML assessment. The reliability and acceptability of extracted information and datasets from implemented technologies in the literature were considered. Findings showed that researchers must proceed with insights they gain, focus on identifying solutions for CoV problems, and introduce new improvements. The growing emphasis on data mining and ML techniques in medical fields can provide the right environment for change and improvement.",

    "title": "Software Architecture Degradation in Open Source Software: A Systematic Literature Review",
    "abstract": "Software architecture (SA) has a prominent role in all stages of system development. Given the persistent evolution of software systems over time, SA tends to be eroded or degraded. Such phenomenon is called architectural degradation. In light of this phenomenon, the current study focuses on problems of architectural erosion in the open-source software (OSS). There has been a significant research activity on the OSS over the last decade. Nonetheless, the architectural degradation problems in the OSS are still scattered and disorganized. In addition, there has been no systematic attempt made on existing studies to provide evidence, insight and better understanding for researchers and practitioners. The main objective of the present study is to provide a profound understanding and to review the existing studies on the architectural erosion of the OSS. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to gather, organize, classify, and analyze the architectural degradation of previous papers published until the year 2020. The data for this study were collected from eight major online databases (ACM, Springer, ScienceDirect, Taylor, IEEE Explorer, Scopus, Web of Science, and Wiley). A total of 74 primary studies were identified as the final samples of this research. The results indicated that rapid software evolution, frequent changes, and the lack of developers\u2019 awareness are the most common causes occurred in architecture degradation. Meanwhile, the prominent key indicators of architectural erosion symptoms are code smells and architectural smells. Additionally, the results indicated the most commonly used of the proposed solution for addressing architectural erosion is the metrics-based strategy. Acknowledging the limitations of the current study, more studies are needed that focus on determining other causes that are still ambiguous and improving the other solutions to provide better results in the precision and effectiveness of addressing architectural erosion.",

    "title": "Traditional Knowledge underlies One Health",
    "abstract": "In September 2019, the Swiss parliament approved a change to the law on hunting and protection of wild mammals and birds ([ 1 ][1]). The modified law is likely to substantially harm already threatened species. In response, concerned citizens collected signatures to trigger a referendum vote. On 27 September, the people of Switzerland will decide whether the country will enact this law ([ 2 ][2]).\n\nThe proposed change to the law introduces a new category of species called \u201cprotected but hunted,\u201d which includes the wolf ( Canis lupus ) and the ibex ( Capra ibex ). The new rules would allow people to cull the wolf population, the latest minimum count of which is 70 ([ 3 ][3]), during 5 months of the year. The hunting season of the ibex would be extended from 3 to 4 months.\n\nChecks and balances in wildlife conservation would be methodically weakened by the change. The list of \u201cprotected but hunted\u201d species will be open to changes by executive decrees of the Federal Council, without requiring parliamentary approval. Nature protection organizations will have fewer opportunities to litigate against decisions to hunt. The modification would further reduce federal power over hunting by delegating decisions to kill \u201cprotected but hunted\u201d species to the cantonal states.\n\nThe law would also disregard science and conservation efforts by introducing justifications for hunting \u201cprotected but hunted\u201d species that are based on haphazard criteria. Hunting of species in that category would be allowed for unspecified hunting reasons, to keep populations at an arbitrarily suitable level, to prevent damages to livestock and infrastructure before any damage has occurred, and because the animals attract the attention of people. The hunting of \u201cprotected but hunted\u201d species would be allowed even in strictly protected game reserves.\n\nThese legal changes were proposed despite the United Nations' call for a focused effort on biodiversity goals in 2020 ([ 4 ][4]). They are an affront to the principle of non-regression of environmental laws ([ 5 ][5]). Switzerland, one of the world's wealthiest countries, should oppose narrow sectorial interests and work to preserve and restore biodiversity.\n\n1.

    "title": "Digital Revolution for Hajj Crowd Management: A Technology Survey",
    "abstract": "Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, is one of the most massive gathering events in the world. It is a mandatory religious activity, once in a lifetime for every sane well-off Muslim. Every year around 3 million Muslims across the globe visit Makkah to perform this spatiotemporally constrained set of religious activities, like circumambulation around the Kaaba and the encampment at Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifah. The key ritual at Rami-al-Jamarat (the stoning-of-the-pillars) is a place seen particularly crowded. The diversified nature of the crowd in terms of race, age, language and culture brings several administrative challenges for local organizers whose responsibility is to ensure the smooth organization of the event. The advent of digital technologies has helped researchers to explore and propose modern methods for better crowd management and devise control strategies to organize such a mass gathering. In this paper, we present a taxonomy that summarizes our survey on the utilization of technology areas for providing needful services and improving crowd management during the Hajj season. These technologies are Wireless, Computer Vision, Spatial Computing, Data Analytics, Mobile Applications, Immersive Technologies, and Crowd Modelling and Simulation. We have also included the current research work and its implementation plan for Hajj 2020. One dimension of the taxonomy is to understand different possible technologies for Crowd management. Another dimension is to understand the impact of technologies to handle such a massive crowd. The discussion section covers a comparison of technologies with multiple aspects that may help researchers to contribute more towards dealing with future mass gathering events.",

    "abstract": "[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported online in Journal of Educational Psychology on Oct 17 2019 (see record 2019-62704-001). In the original article, Tables 2 and 4 contained typographical errors regarding the reporting of some sample sizes. In Table 2, for the Unadjusted Analyses section, the n for the \u201cNo participation in school music\u201d group should read 75,616 for the Math 10 group, and 95,873 for the Science 10 group while the n for the \u201cParticipation in school music\u201d group should read 13,772 for the Math 10 group, and 15,416 for the Science 10 group. In Table 4, for the Unadjusted Analyses section, the n for the \u201cNo participation in school music\u201d group should read 75,616 for the Math 10 group, and 95,873 for the Science 10 group. All calculations were based on the correct sample sizes, the typographical error was isolated to n reported in the aforementioned instances in these two tables. All versions of this article have been corrected.] The present study employed population-level educational records from 4 public school student cohorts (n = 112,916; Grades 7\u201312) in British Columbia (Canada) to examine relationships between music education (any participation, type of participation, music achievement, and engagement level) and mathematics and science achievement in Grade 10 as well as English achievement in Grades 10 and 12, while controlling for language/cultural background, Grade 7 academic achievement, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. Music participation was related to higher scores on all 4 subjects and these relationships were stronger for instrumental music than vocal music (Cohen\u2019s d range: .28 to .44 [small-medium effect sizes] and .05 to .13 [null-small effect sizes]). School music achievement positively related to scores on all subjects; such relationships were stronger for achievement in instrumental music compared with vocal music. Higher levels of music engagement (number of courses) was related to higher exam scores on all subjects; this pattern was more pronounced for very high engagement in instrumental music (d range: .37 to .55; medium effect sizes) compared with vocal music (d range: .11 to .26; small effect sizes). The effect sizes of these group differences are greater than the effect sizes corresponding to average annual gains of students\u2019 academic achievement during high school\u2014in other words, highly engaged instrumental music students were, on average, academically over 1 year ahead of their peers. The findings suggest that multiyear engagement in music, especially instrumental music, may benefit high school academic achievement. Findings and implications are discussed within the broader interdisciplinary literature on music learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "The Spatial Distribution of Dermacentor Ticks (Ixodidae) in Germany\u2014Evidence of a Continuing Spread of Dermacentor reticulatus",
    "abstract": "In Europe, two tick species of the genus Dermacentor occur, Dermacentor marginatus and Dermacentor reticulatus. When the spatial distribution of both species in Germany was studied comprehensively for the first time in 1976, D. marginatus populations were recorded along the Rhine and Main river valleys in southwestern Germany, while D. reticulatus was very rare. In the last 50 years, however, a considerable range expansion of D. reticulatus has been noted in several European countries. To assess the current distribution of Dermacentor spp. in Germany, citizens were asked to send in ticks suspected to belong to the genus Dermacentor or that were of \u201cunusual\u201d appearance. From February 2019 until February 2020, 3,902 Dermacentor ticks were received in total. Of those, 15.48% (604/3,902) were identified as D. marginatus and 84.24% (3,287/3,902) as D. reticulatus, while 11 specimens could not be identified to species level. The majority of D. reticulatus specimens was collected from dogs (1,212/2,535; 47.12%), while D. marginatus was mostly collected from horses (184/526; 34.98%). Our results confirm that the adults of both Dermacentor species are active all year round. D. reticulatus specimens were sent in from all federal states except the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, while D. marginatus specimens were only received from locations in southwestern Germany. Overall, data obtained from this citizen-science study show that D. reticulatus has significantly expanded its range, especially in northern Germany. Regarding D. marginatus, new locations northwest of the previous range were detected, although the distribution has remained rather stable as compared to D. reticulatus. The spread of D. reticulatus, the vector of Babesia canis, is of major importance for veterinarians and dog owners in terms of canine babesiosis outbreaks or endemization in hitherto B. canis-free areas. Thus, veterinarians and veterinary students need to be informed about the new situation to be able to give adequate advice to dog owners on the extended D. reticulatus range and appropriate control measures.",

    "title": "Evaluation of cultural control and resistance\u2010breeding strategies for suppression of whitefly infestation of cassava at the landscape scale: a simulation modeling approach",
    "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is an important vector of virus diseases, impacting cassava production in East Africa. To date, breeding efforts in this region have focused on disease resistance. Here we use a spatially\u2010explicit simulation model to explore how breeding strategies for whitefly resistance will influence the population dynamics of whitefly in the context of regional variation in cassava crop management practices. RESULTS Simulations indicated that regions with a short cropping cycle and two cropping seasons per year were associated with high whitefly abundance. Nymph mortality and antixenosis resistance mechanisms were more effective than mechanisms that lead to longer whitefly development times. When spatial variation was introduced in heterogeneous landscapes, however, negative consequences of the antixenosis effect were observed in fields containing whitefly susceptible varieties, unless the proportion of whitefly resistant variety in the landscape was low (~10%) or the amount of matrix in the landscape was high (~75%). CONCLUSION We show the importance of considering cropping regime and landscape management context when developing and deploying whitefly\u2010resistant cassava varieties. Recommendations differ significantly between regions. There may also be unintended negative consequences of higher whitefly densities for whitefly susceptible varieties if uptake of the new variety in a landscape is high, depending on the mechanism of resistance and the landscape context. Furthermore, we show that in some cases, such as where there is substantial fallow combined with a short single\u2010season crop, the management characteristics of the existing cropping regime alone may be effective at controlling whitefly populations. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Background: On December 8, 2019, the first new coronavirus case was discovered in Wuhan, China, and an intensive outbreak incepted in the next month (about January 20). Virologicalists and epidemiologists predict that it will reach a peak in about 90 days and fade away till the end in about 4 months (Early April), the entire epidemic will terminate in early May. The daily rise in confirmed cases and the increase in the number of outbreak communities on the epidemic map always hit the nerves of panic. On January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared China \u2019s new coronavirus epidemic an \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d (PHEIC). At this time, citizens from multiple nations including China express their grave concerns on the diagnosis, prediction and heal of the virus contagion. \n \nObjective: This research will analyze the COVID-19 general diagnosis index with artifical intelligence (AI) to improve the diagnosis accuracy for clinical purpose. \n \nMethods: We included 32 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed, and 85 undiagnosis patients in Taizhou Public Hygiene in Taizhou Hospital, of Zhejiang province, between January 17, 2020 and February 1, 2020, and the positive confirmed patients were diagnosized by real-time RT-PCR. At the same time, 85 patients with negative nucleic acid of COVID-19 were collected during the same period, and the results were followed up to February 2, 2020. Among radiological characteristics and laboratory data (the first result of the Group) for analysis. We used four types of AI techonlogy to screen important index regarding COVID-19 diagnosis. several classical and state-of-the-art attribute reduction and feature selection methods, sparse rescaled linear square regression (SRLSR), evolutionary non-dominated radial slots based algorithm, attribute reduction with multi-objective decomposition-ensemble optimizer (ARMED), Gradient boosted feature selection (GFS), recursive feature elimination (RFE), were applied to deal with this problem. \n \nResults: We employed four types of AI technology to screen all patients, achieve 18 indexes associated with significant COVID-19 diagnosis and the most important attribute is WBC, Eosinophil count, Eosinophil rate, 2019 novel coronavirus RNA (2019n-CoV) and Amyloid-A in laboratory, also matched with 2019 China virus diagnosis clinical guide. \n \nConclusion: We developed a novel and accurate method to quickly achieve COVID-19 diagnosis association indexes to improve confirmed diagnosis rate for clinical use. \n \nFunding Statement: This work is funded by the Science and Technology Development Fund of Macau (FDCT/131/2016/A3, FDCT/0015/2018/A1, FDCT/126/2014/A3) and Start-up Research Grant (SRG2016-00082-FHS), the Multi-Year Research Grant (MYRG2019-00069-FHS, MYRG2016-00069-FST), the intramural research program of Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Guangzhou Science and Technology Innovation and Development of Special Funds, Grant no.

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are lower in Appalachian regions of the United States than in non-Appalachian regions. Given the availability of various screening modalities, there is critical need for culturally relevant interventions addressing multiple socioecological levels to reduce the regional CRC burden. In this report, we describe the development and baseline findings from year 1 of \u201cAccelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science (ACCSIS) in Appalachia,\u201d a 5-year, National Cancer Institute Cancer MoonshotSM-funded multilevel intervention (MLI) project to increase screening in Appalachian Kentucky and Ohio primary care clinics. Project development was theory-driven and included the establishment of both an external Scientific Advisory Board and a Community Advisory Board to provide guidance in conducting formative activities in two Appalachian counties: one in Kentucky and one in Ohio. Activities included identifying and describing the study communities and primary care clinics, selecting appropriate evidence-based interventions (EBIs), and conducting a pilot test of MLI strategies addressing patient, provider, clinic, and community needs. Key informant interviews identified multiple barriers to CRC screening, including fear of screening, test results, and financial concerns (patient level); lack of time and competing priorities (provider level); lack of reminder or tracking systems and staff burden (clinic level); and cultural issues, societal norms, and transportation (community level). With this information, investigators then offered clinics a menu of EBIs and strategies to address barriers at each level. Clinics selected individually tailored MLIs, including improvement of patient education materials, provision of provider education (resulting in increased knowledge, p = .003), enhancement of electronic health record (EHR) systems and development of clinic screening protocols, and implementation of community CRC awareness events, all of which promoted stool-based screening (i.e., FIT or FIT-DNA). Variability among clinics, including differences in EHR systems, was the most salient barrier to EBI implementation, particularly in terms of tracking follow-up of positive screening results, whereas the development of clinic-wide screening protocols was found to promote fidelity to EBI components. Lessons learned from year 1 included increased recognition of variability among the clinics and how they function, appreciation for clinic staff and provider workload, and development of strategies to utilize EHR systems. These findings necessitated a modification of study design for subsequent years. Trial NCT04427527 is registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov and was registered on June 11, 2020.",

    "title": "COVID-19 and School Closures.",
    "abstract": "To mitigate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), US states enacted a suite of nonpharmaceutical interventions. School closures were among the most consistently applied of these interventions. Over a 10-day period in March, all 50 US states closed kindergarten-grade 12 schools and childcare centers; nearly all colleges and universities followed suit. These closures were unprecedented in scope, affecting 21 million children in childcare, 57 million studentsinkindergarten-grade12,and20millioncollegeanduniversity students. School closures were not limited to the US. By mid-April, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% (nearly 1.6 billion) of the world\u2019s students.1 With limited information regarding COVID-19 in children, state and local officials were guided by evidence from other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, in which children have a substantial role in transmission. Although the evidence on effectiveness is mixed, school closures have been promoted as effective mitigation strategies during pandemics.2,3 Understanding the effect school closures had on COVID-19 outcomes in the spring of 2020 is crucial for informing preparations for the fall. In this issue of JAMA, Auger et al4 estimate the association of school closures with COVID-19 incidence and mortality. In this complex study, the authors used interrupted time series analyses of data from all 50 states on the timing of school closures (and other nonpharmaceutical interventions), and daily COVID-19 incidence and death counts. The analyses compared the change in outcomes before and after school closure, adjusting for state-level measures of testing capacity, population density, health status, and social vulnerability. To estimate the absolute differences associated with school closure, the authors compared projected incidence and mortality had schools remained open vs the modeled outcomes for school closure. Auger et al4 found that school closure was associated with a \u221262% (95% CI, \u221271% to \u221249%) relative change in COVID-19 incidence per week, corresponding to an estimated absolute difference of 423.9 (95% CI, 375.0 to 463.7) cases per 100 000. The authors also reported that school closure was associated with a \u221258% (95% CI, \u221268% to \u221246%) relative change in mortality per week, corresponding to an estimated absolute difference in mortality of 12.6 (95% CI, 11.8 to 13.6) deaths per 100 000. Extrapolating these results to the US population, the authors estimate that school closure may have been associated with 1.37 million fewer cases of COVID-19 over a 26-day period and 40 600 fewer deaths over a 16-day period during the spring of 2020. It is important to emphasize these are estimates. The authors thoughtfully discuss the numerous challenges with such an ambitious analysis. First, school closures were enacted in close proximity (interquartile range, 2-14 days) to other physical distancing measures, such as nonessential business closures and stay-at-home orders, making it difficult to disentangle the potential effect of each intervention. Second, the analysis does not elucidate mechanisms through which school closures might affect viral transmission. Whether the estimated associations between school closures and COVID-19 outcomes derive from reducing contacts among children or among their parents and caregivers, who are also less mobile as a result, is not known. Third, the analysis cannot discern the optimal duration, combination, and sequence of nonpharmaceutical interventions, including school closures. Had school closures occurred later than other interventions, the estimated associations may have been markedly different. Fourth, the study design and analysis are consistent with association and not causation. All of these limitations create challenges for using these estimates to predict the potential effect of school closures in the coming school year. School officials should consider findings from Auger et al4 in the context of an evolving evidence base on SARS-CoV-2. A recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) committee reported that less than 5% of reported cases have been among those younger than 18 years, and concluded that children with COVID-19 are more likely than adults to have mild or no symptoms.5 However, there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the role of children and youth in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, leading the NASEM report to conclude \u201cthere is insufficient evidence with which to determine how easily children and youth contract the virus and how contagious they are once they do.\u201d Without a significant advance in evidence on these points, school administrators will be left to make high-stakes decisions without certainty. Although the findings from the study by Auger et al4 suggest a role for school closures in virus mitigation, school and health officials must balance this with academic, health, and economic consequences. A key challenge is that these other outcomes are likely more diffuse, accrue over a longer time horizon, may have consequences that last decades, and are more difficult to count than COVID-19 outcomes, including cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, which are measured in real time and are widely reported. The harms associated with school closures are profound. Despite efforts by school districts to Viewpoint page 833",

    "title": "Marine plastic debris in Indonesia: Baseline estimates (2010-2019) and monitoring strategies (2021-2025)",
    "abstract": "Indonesia set the mission to reduce marine plastic debris by 70% between 2018-2025 with a global significance to support the UN Sustainable Development Goal 14.1. This short communication assesses marine debris baseline estimates in Indonesia before 2020 from available contributions and provides recommendations for monitoring marine debris mitigation between 2021-2025. Widely ranging model estimates of plastic debris released into seas highlight the roles of data source, the spatial resolution of models, and in situ data to provide representative baseline values. Recognizing the strengths and uncertainties of available contributions, model outputs converge on a baseline value of 0.52 \u00b1 0.36 million tons (Mt) per year prior to 2020 in Indonesia, therefore setting a targeted reduced number of 0.16 Mt of marine debris releases in 2025. The Indonesian Institute of Sciences showed a preliminary value of plastic debris accumulation in beaches at 113.58 \u00b1 83.88 g/m2 monthly or equivalent to 0.40 Mt/year by assuming plastic debris is most pervasive within 3 meters from Indonesia\u2019s 99,093 km-long coastlines. It is important to distinguish that while river monitoring data informs land-based plastic debris releases, stranded beach debris represents a fraction of debris that is not present in the water column and bottom sediments. Moving forward, monitoring initiatives to mitigate marine debris should leverage on nationwide municipality-level model estimates (e.g., the source to leakage route framework of the National Plastic Action Partnership) as well as in situ river and coastal particularly but not limited to sites co-identified in previous monitoring studies (i.e., Medan, Batam-Bintan, Padang, Jakarta-Seribu Islands, Semarang, Pontianak, Bali, Lombok, Makassar, Manado, Bitung). The latter should be conducted at least seasonally, considering evidence of monsoonal variations of marine debris release and accumulation in Indonesia. Indonesia's vastness and regional diversity require coordination among stakeholders (government agencies, research institutions, universities, NGOs, citizen scientists) to monitor progress in the environments.",

Both the\u00a0 premier supercomputing conferences ISC'20 and SC20 went virtual,\u00a0 preventing users from exploring the show floors with their examples of novel architectures and seeing the demos of their related tools. Companies have also slowed their procurement of high-end systems during 2020, as was discussed during the presentation of top500.org statistics at the Top-500 Birds-of-a-Feather session at SC20. The Top-500 list is a measurement of the world's largest computers using the High-Performance Linpack benchmark (see\u00a0www.top500.org). Systems must solve large dense systems of linear equations without using the operation-saving Strassen algorithm or a mix of lower precision, but doing the calculations conforming to LU factorization with partial pivoting using\u00a0\u00a0\\(\u2154n^3+O(n^2)\\) double-precision (64-bit)\u00a0 floating point numbers.Despite less turnover of the world's largest computer systems, technologies continue to advance, and the trends are more interesting and diverse than ever.The US dominated the\u00a0 computing industry\u2014including the supercomputer industry\u2014for years, until Japan gave the US a jolt with the introduction of the Earth Simulator back in 2002.\u00a0 This put supercomputing back in the spotlight, especially in the US, but also in Europe.

    "title": "Lifecycle of the invasive omnivore, Forficula auricularia, in Australian grain growing environments",
    "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND The European earwig, Forficula auricularia (L.) (Dermaptera: Forficulidae), is regarded as an important beneficial in many orchard environments but has the potential to be a plant pest in other systems, including to grain crops. Due to its agricultural importance, the lifecycle of F. auricularia has been widely studied in North America and Europe. However, much less is known in the southern hemisphere, including Australia where F. auricularia has been present for over 170\u2009years. RESULTS To elucidate the lifecycle of F. auricularia, we monitored five sites in grain\u2010growing areas of southern Australia using two different trap types. Adults were found year\u2010round, but most prevalent from late\u2010spring to mid\u2010winter. First instars were typically found from mid to late winter. Second, third and fourth instars occurred from winter through to late spring. The seasonal development of F. auricularia in Australia may be much earlier than observed in comparable North American studies. Degree day modelling highlights variation in development times across the active season for F. auricularia across our sites. CONCLUSION Forficula auricularia is well adapted to the Australian grain growing environments. The timing of egg hatching aligns closely with crop emergence, juveniles then develop alongside the crop, and adult development occurs by harvest time in late spring. These findings are important given that many of these crops (canola, lucerne, pulses) are vulnerable to attack by F. auricularia during emergence and development. They also suggest a phenotypic capacity of this species to adapt different phenology after introduction into a novel environment. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

    "abstract": "The year 2020 will be remembered as the year of the world pandemic from a corona virus, COVID-19. The virus has created a time of unprecedented threat which has been responded to in various ways by governments around the world, however most responses have resulted in some period of restriction to movements within and across communities and disruptions and changes to usual performance of many occupations. The pandemic has provided an exceptional period in time which is a rich context for studying humans as occupational beings. Mainstream epidemiological and economic responses have received much attention in the popular media. In this call for papers we invite authors to submit primary studies, reviews or theoretical papers related to the experience of COVID-19 from an occupational perspective. An occupational perspective may provide knowledge that not only contributes to occupational science but provides information to increase the resilience of individuals and populations to respond to future pandemics whilst recovering from the one currently experienced. We especially invite submissions on the following topics, among others:",

    "title": "From Trial to Implementation, Bringing Team-Based Learning Online\u2014Duke-NUS Medical School\u2019s Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "abstract": "In response to the increasing community spread of COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020, the Singapore healthcare system moved to prioritize pandemic management over other nonessential services. The delivery of medical school curriculum and learning processes, which heavily involves clinical faculty from various healthcare institutions, had to be reconfigured and reengineered as healthcare staff reassignment and infection containment practices are escalated. A few years earlier, in 2015, Duke-NUS had implemented an eLearning week, where face-to-face activities were conducted online in order to prepare for unforeseen disruptions to the curriculum. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we first put these practices to use when enhanced social distancing restrictions were mandated across the country in February 2020, and university guidelines required that all classes with 50 or more students be moved online [1]. As the pandemic escalated, Singapore imposed increased movement restrictions in April 2020 and all educational institutions were instructed to move to full home-based learning [2]. The transition to online learning may be smoother for a traditional lecture-based course, as educators can share prerecorded lectures, or even deliver live lectures through videoconferencing platforms. Learning resources can be posted on their institution\u2019s learning management system for their students to access remotely. However, a growing trend in higher education is towards the use of \u201cflipped classrooms\u201d, where the acquisition of information is done by the student prior to class, and the faculty use class time to reinforce the knowledge that students have acquired by providing opportunities for students to apply the knowledge through application exercises [3]. A disruption in face-to-face teaching is challenging for Duke-NUS, for two reasons. First, the foundational science concepts covered in the first academic year are revisited and built upon later during the clinical years. Disrupting the delivery of the foundational science content would have profound effects on subsequent parts of the curriculum. Second, DukeNUS employs a complex learning pedagogy which emphasizes peer-to-peer learning through faculty-facilitated, studentled discussions [4]. Known as TeamLEAD (Learn, Engage, Apply and Develop), the primary mode of teaching for the first-year medical students at Duke-NUS is an adaptation of Team-Based Learning (TBL). The processes of TeamLEAD and TBL have been described elsewhere [5\u20137]. In brief, the three defining features of TeamLEAD and TBL are pre-class preparation, the readiness assurance tests (RATs), and the team application exercises [8]. In the TeamLEAD and TBL class formats, students first take the readiness assurance tests individually (individual readiness assurance test (IRAT)), then as a team (group readiness assurance test (GRAT)). It is after completion of the GRAT that TeamLEAD diverges from TBL. Known as the modified TeamLEAD Readiness Assurance Process (mTRAP), teams will now submit any unresolved queries to the whole class.

    "abstract": "lar search term was from the previous year; Disney Plus was the top searched term on Google in the United States for 2019.1 Given current events, we wonder if any of the following terms will become the most popular for 2020: pandemics, coronavirus, COVID-19? We ponder this because it appears from media reports that public acceptance of global pandemics may have become a new \u201cnormal\u201d threat. Although global pandemics have been discussed on television and in movies for years, they have had somewhat of a science fiction angle to them even though they occurred often in past centuries. More than 10 years ago, a few of us discussed out-of-thebox ideas, such as \u201cwhat if the power grid went completely down?,\u201d \u201cwhat if the banks fail, and no one can access cash from an ATM?,\u201d and \u201cwhat if society completely or partially shuts down from a global cyber event?\u201d In a 2009 article, we discussed various scenarios of the last idea.2 The events of the coronavirus (CV) pandemic over the past few months have made us rethink that article. Note: we are not sensationalizing the CV tragedy. Rather, we hope that revisiting the article might put the current pandemic into a perspective that can help us learn how to better deal with future biological viruses and avoid cyberpandemics. So, what is a cyberpandemic? Quite simply, it is a massive disruption of computing service that triggers secondand third-order failures of computing and noncomputing systems worldwide. Consequences could include widespread failure or malfunctioning of critical infrastructure systems and the associated major societal damage. Perpetrators of cyberpandemics could include rogue governments (or elements therein), terrorist groups, corporations and consortia (that may profit from the pandemic\u2019s affects), malicious actors (of varied motivations), individuals, or even an accident (for example, a weaponized malware gone awry). As far as we know, a cyberpandemic has never been successfully perpetrated, but we all know that the weaponization of cyberspace is very real. A full potential of that is yet to occur. The conditions that could lead to a cyberpandemic are similar or analogous to those for a biological pandemic: human complexity, attack multiplicity, and delayed effects. In the cyber world, human complexity is represented by people \u201cpacked too tightly in cyberspace\u201d and the resultant complex social interactions online. Attack multiplicity means that the attack involved multiple Cyberpandemics",

Since 1971, there have been more than 300 articles published in Computer on the topic of electronic privacy and about three times that number on cybersecurity, with many of these articles covering both topics. Roughly a third of all these articles appeared within the past five years, indicating that there is a lot of interest in security and privacy. These statistics are also telling in that Computer competes for content with other IEEE Computer Society publications, particularly IEEE Security and Privacy, which was first published in 2003. In their seminal article from 2004, Avi\u017eienis et al.1 treated security as one of the attributes of dependable systems, defining depend abi l it y as \u201cthe ability to deliver service that can justifiably be trusted.\u201d They made no reference to privacy. Likewise, that same year, Voas2 mentioned security but not privacy as one of the many quality attributes of software. Looking back at these articles, one might ask, for instance, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we want both security and privacy, given our dependence on the navigation apps on our smartphones and that we need to not only trust in the integrity of the data these apps use to compute travel routes but also in the protection of the privacy of our location data? What are the tradeoffs among security, privacy, and other system attributes, such as testability?\u201d In a systems context, it seems natural to think about the interplay between security and privacy requirements, policies, and mechanisms. Given the seemingly ever-growing impact of security and privacy on society, from electronic voting to computer-based contact tracing to automated driving, we thought the readers of Computer would benefit from a virtual roundtable in which a panel of experts provide its views on the relationship between security and privacy. To draw the attention of prospective panelists, we posed a highly charged teaser question. Is the relationship between the two terms best described as 1) security or privacy or 2) security and privacy; that is, can you have both? Our tactic had the intended effect. We received feedback on the title of the roundtable even before we made the questions available to the panelists.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Depression is one of the most common mental disorders which decreases the quality of life and causes burden for individual, families and society. It is estimated that by the year 2020 it would be the second leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), second only to ischemic heart disease. Material and Methods: This was a prospective study design. The study was conducted in the department of Psychiatry Sher-IKashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) Medical College and Hospital, Bemina, Jammu and Kashmir. The study was approved by the SKIMS Ethical Committee. The study sample comprised of 200 patients diagnosed with first episode depression (Major depressive disorder) attending psychiatric outpatient department and diagnosed by using DSM 5 criterion. The severity of the depression was assessed by HAM-D scale. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria during the study period were screened. Results: In our study majority of our patients81 (42.4%) were aged between 18-29 years, The mean age was 35.3\u00b113.56.Males constituted 106 (55.5%), 101 (52.9%) patients who belonged to rural areas and 90 (47.1%) were from urban areas, 98 (51.3%) were uneducated. There were 104 (54.5%) married men and 119 (62.3%) patients in our study belonged to middle socioeconomic class. Conclusion: Clinical profile revealed that most of the patients had mild to moderate form of depression, a few also reported severe form of depression. Careful diagnosis of depression can help in early starting of treatment so that it can greatly decrease morbidity in patients",

    "abstract": "The wonderful conference, the 4th International Conference on Mechanical, System and Control Engineering (ICMSC 2020), which should be taken place in Russia traditionally since 2017, was held virtually under the unusual conditions that COVID-19 virus imposes this year. The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our priority. The COVID-19 is unpredictable, so conference postponement met uncertainty, while many scholars and researchers want to attend this long-waited conference and have academic exchanges with their peers. 2020 is certainly not easy - the situation with the COVID-19 virus is not easy in the whole world. But I want to note that there are no barriers to science, and we continue to work on our research areas remotely, using modern technical means. ICMSC 2020 chose Zoom as technical support to hold this virtual conference and each presenter holds 15 minutes for their work and have a pleasant discussion after presentation. Before conference, all the authors have prepared a video as backup in case there might be some technical or network problem, eventually, ICMSC 2020 gain a great success and became an effective communication platform for all the participants. The subject of the conference is devoted to the mechanics, systems and control, and has many applications in science and technology. Traditionally, the conference reviewed reports on the engineering industry, production organization and the space industry, and brought together participants from many countries from Russia, China and there were representatives of European countries. They communicated scientific sections were at the conference: Control Theory and Engineering, System Modelling, Power Engineering and simulations, etc. They put up various scientific approaches to solving similar problems. This is the most important advantage of an international conference to exchange experiences. I believe that the experience that we get from mutual communication using technical means will help not stop the progress in the development of engineering and engineering science. Finally, I wish you healthy, friends and every success! Conference Steering Chair Vsevolod V. Koryanov Bauman Moscow State Technical University, Russia",

    "abstract": "This workshop focuses on bringing together researchers and practitioners working on systems and applications in the Smart City domain. Since nearly 60% of the world population lives in urban areas, the majority of the planet's resources are consumed in cities. As a consequence, applications targeting urban areas can positively impact a significant fraction of the population. Context-aware applications in the smart city range from transportation, energy, safety to low-carbon living. The ongoing advances in Pervasive Computing and Wireless Communication technology have delivered interesting hardware platforms that are suitable for city-scale infrastructure deployments and networking. Also, novel techniques using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are now available for intelligent (real time) analytics and decision making by processing streaming sensor data collected from the surrounding environment. Fleets of smart cars can be distributed computational and sensing resource along with increasingly large crowds of people equipped with sensor-rich mobile and wearable devices, which can facilitate wide-scale crowd-sensing and crowd-sourcing. We are pleased to notify that this year we have accepted 6 highly exciting papers to be presented at the workshop. The accepted papers shall have significant contribution in city-scale smart system development. We are also looking forward to the keynote speech by Prof. Hirozumi Yamaguchi from the Mobile Computing Laboratory of the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology at Osaka University, Japan. This year, we plan to introduce an open discussion forum for identifying novel issues and challenges associated with Pervasive Context-Aware Smart Cities and Intelligent Transport Systems. The authors of the accepted papers have addressed various challenges to enable pervasive context-aware smart cities. Yuan",

    "title": "The Implementation of Online Learning in Early Childhood Education During the Covid-19 Pandemic",
    "abstract": "Covid-19 has changed the learning process from class attendance to distance learning using the Internet.\u00a0Early childhood education is threatened to enter into the lost generation, due to distance learning, which causes confusion for teachers and parents to be able to provide the best stimulation for them.\u00a0Therefore, the Indonesian government made a new policy on online learning. The objectives of this research are to find how effective at online learning policy formulation, how\u00a0productive\u00a0it is in policy implementation, and what are the obstacles of\u00a0the\u00a0implementation at Early-Childhood Education (ECE). This qualitative research uses a mixed method approach with an iterative analysis design, conducted in Central Java Province in 35 districts / cities with 1,899 respondents. Data collection techniques with open-closed questionnaires, study from 15 documentation, and in-depth interviews. Data analysis uses quantitative-qualitative software Nvivo12+, with Miles and Huberman models. The results showed\u00a0the policy formulation of online learning at ECE has been effective.\u00a0However, the implementation of online learning policy at ECE still takes a lot of effort to become more powerful in preventing a decline in learning.\u00a0There are five obstacles in in applying this in the field,\u00a0namely the ability of teachers, the ability of parents, economic capability, facility constraints, and pedagogical constraints. \n\u00a0Keywords: Online Learning Policy; Children Engagement; Learning Management System \nReferences \nAllen, I.

    "title": "The fall of the Murchison meteorite",
    "abstract": "The year 1969 was an awesome one for cosmochemists. Scientists worldwide were gearing up for the return of the first lunar samples, courtesy of the Apollo 11 astronauts, on July 24. NASA had arranged for teams of scientists to collaborate on the initial characterization of the samples, and there were well-characterized standard samples making the rounds of state-of-the-art analytical laboratories\u2014in some cases newly established for the occasion. On February 8 of that year, the Allende carbonaceous chondrite had fallen. At over 2000 kg of recovered samples, this is still the largest carbonaceous chondrite fall known (see McCoy and Corrigan 2020). This provided scientists with the opportunity to test and refine analytical capabilities being prepared for the Apollo samples, and at the same time opened a new window into the early solar system. In December 1969, Japanese scientists would serendipitously discover the first nine Yamato meteorites, which led to a revolution in the recovery of meteorite falls (see Yamaguchi et al. 2020). On September 28, the fall of the Murchison meteorite added icing to the cake. At 10:58 AM local time, explosions announced the entry of this visitor to Victoria, Australia, on that clear morning. The best summaries of the fall are given by Seargent (1990) and Lock (2019). A sonic boom rattled windows and shook houses, as a bright fireball was observed to explode into multiple large fragments (reports of the number vary) and a shower of stones fell extending from the villages of Wahring and Murchison East, across Murchison Township, and on toward the nearby Waranga Basin (a lake), a westerly oriented direction. Witnesses reported that the fireball was bright orange, and left a trail of white to black smoke, which persisted for at least 2 min. The meteorite strewn field measured at least 11 9 3 km\u2014the exact size is not well known because field searches were somewhat limited by fears of encounters with deadly tiger snakes (Gillick, personal communication). At first, the fireball and explosion were taken by some to be a distressed airplane. Many ground observers noted a methylated spirits\u2013like smell. The first stones were recovered later that morning at Brisbane\u2019s Dairy, one of which had smashed into and dented a steel fence. A 650 g stone was later found to have penetrated a corrugated iron roof 2 km from the dairy. No humans or animals are known to have been injured by falling stones, but some dogs and cows were reported to have run for shelter. Locals and visitors collected samples for months, well into 1970. Of course, samples collected after rain were relatively degraded. Searches as late as the 1990s still produced recognizable meteorites. Ultimately over 100 kg of stones was recovered, but this must have been a small fraction of the total fallen mass (again\u2014snakes; Fig. 1). Most of the samples are currently held at the Field Museum (Chicago, ~50 kg) and at the National Museum of Natural History (Washington, ~20 kg; Grady 2000). Only a few kilograms remain in museums in Victoria. The exceptional total mass of sample available for lab study has made Murchison a gold mine for astromineralogists and cosmochemists studying the formation of primitive small solar system bodies, the origin and evolution of water and organics in the early solar system, and astrobiology. Murchison joins Allende as touchstones for every new analytical instrument brought to bear on primitive meteorites. When someone needs large masses of a hydrous or carbonaceous chondrite to make amino acid measurements, or bulk isotopic or trace element measurements, or shock impact experiments, they always turn to Murchison. It is one of the most repeatedly brutalized astromaterials we have. Fortunately, a large total mass of samples remain for future brutalization.

    "title": "Mind-Sets of Worried Citizens and the \u2018Real-World Experiment\u2019 of Covid-19: A Mind Genomics Cartography",
    "abstract": "Two groups of 51 US respondents each evaluated combinations of statements about the problems and solutions that a country might face. The two studies were run a year apart, May 2019 (before the Covid-19 pandemic) and May 2020 (at the then current height of the pandemic). The problems and solutions were combined by experimental design, creating a unique set of 24 vignettes for each respondent. The responses to the vignettes (negative versus positive outcome, based on the vignette) were deconstructed to the contribution of each of the 16 elements (four problems, 12 solutions). Three mind-sets emerged, based on clustering the pattern of responses to the 16 elements from each of the 100 respondents: MS1\u2013Startups, students; MS2\u2013Change and Investment; MS3\u2013Family social. Each mind-set shows a specific pattern of responses to problems, solutions, and the effect of Covid-19. The granularity afforded by Mind Genomics allows the researcher a new and profoundly deeper understanding of the mind of the citizen, opening a new area of psychological science. The three mind-sets distribute similarly through the population, requiring short intervention, the Personal Viewpoint Identifier, a set of six questions, the pattern of response to which assigns a new person to one of the three mind-sets.",

    "title": "\u2018Siege Mentality\u2019 Reaction to the Pandemic: Israeli Memes During Covid-19",
    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a tsunami of memes on the social networking scene. Typically for times of crisis, people struggle to maintain a high spirit. Humor provided a tool for coping with stress and comfort in the shadow of isolation, unemployment, and the horror of death. The closures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic gave people plenty of free time. This fact, together with access to sophisticated apps, resulted in a spontaneous global wave of corona-related memes. This social phenomenon was transmitted in the social networks as virally as the coronavirus itself (Jandri\u0107 2020). In this paper, we examine memes circulating in Israel during the Covid-19 pandemic from the beginning of March to the end of May 2020. We show how memes can prove a useful political and social research tool that teaches us how societies react in times of crisis. During the closure period, there was an exceptional political crisis in Israel. The Covid-19 pandemic began in the absence of a government in Israel. Unprecedented since the founding of the state in 1948, there were three elections in 1 year, none of which resulted in the establishment of a permanent government. Political tensions culminated in hostilities between two main blocs: the political right and its leader Benjamin Netanyahu, and the left and center bloc that opposes the prime minister\u2019s Postdigital Science and Education https://doi.org/10.1007/s42438-020-00175-8",

    "title": "The Development of Two-tier Multiple Choice Assessment Instrument to Measure Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) of The Students on Excretion System Material",
    "abstract": "Science learning based on 2013 curriculum requires the students to be able at analyzing, evaluating, and creating to achieve higher order thinking skills (HOTS). The results of observation at SMP N 2 Sukolilo showed that there was no task or question which was specifically used to measure HOTS of the students. The aim of this study is to analyze the characteristics of two-tier multiple choice assessment instrument and HOTS ability of the students. This research was conducted by using Research and Development (R&D) method. Samples were taken by random sampling technique from the population of class IX students of SMP N 2 Sukolilo in the academic year 2019/2020, then class IX C was selected for small-scale trial, class IX B was selected for large-scale trial, and class IX A was selected for trial use. Data was taken by some methods such as test, questionnaire, and documentation. The characteristics of two-tier multiple choice assessment instrument was analyzed by expert judgment and empirical testing. Whereas, HOTS level of the students was analyzed using the HOTS Category Scale. The results of the analysis of the characteristics of two-tier multiple choice assessment instrument indicated that the developed instrument had fulfilled the requirement as a good instrument, namely (1) valid, with the result of expert validation as many as 79% (feasible) and the results of the item analysis was 0.49 (sufficient ); (2) reliable, with the reliability result was 0.40 (reliable); (3) relevant, representative, practical, and specific as indicated by the results of the teacher's questionnaire responses with the percentage 75% (good); (4) discriminatory power, with the average of analysis result was 0.36 (good); and (5) proportional / difficulty level, with the analysis result of most questions in the moderate category. Furthermore, the analysis results of HOTS level of the students showed that the students on the large-scale trial were mostly in the moderate category (67%) and some of them in a small portion were in the low category (33%). While, HOTS level of the students on the trial use showed that most of the students were in the moderate category (50%), some of them were in the low category (30%), and a small portion of them were in the high category (20%). The conclusion of this study is the developed two-tier multiple choice assessment instrument has been feasible, because it has met the requirements as a good instrument and can be used to measure HOTS of the students.",

    "abstract": "While deaths caused by interactions with dogs in medico-legal situations most often involve trauma from attacks, in certain circumstances, deaths may occur from sharing environmental hazards that the animal has been exposed to during attempted rescues. Search of the Forensic Science South Australia (FSSA), Australia, autopsy database over a 16-year period from 2004 to 2020 found three such cases, including two women aged 46 and 61 years who were both killed in separate incidents after being struck by vehicles when they attempted to rescue dogs that had strayed onto busy roads. The final case was a 53-year-old man who drowned in a river while trying to rescue his dog. A review of Internet databases and news sources revealed other cases where would-be dog rescuers had drowned in rivers and the sea or had succumbed to hypothermia in frozen lakes and waterways. Other hazardous situations involve house fires, falls from heights, electrocution and envenomation. The characteristic features of these cases are of a dog (often a pet) getting itself into, or being found in, a dangerous situation, with owners or bystanders then attempting rescue. The dangers of the situation are either ignored or underestimated by the rescuers who often also misjudge the capacity of dogs to survive/self-rescue. Cases may therefore be encountered in forensic investigations where death or serious injury has occurred during attempts to protect an animal from particular types of environmental dangers. Unlike the owners, it is not infrequently documented that the dogs have survived the danger unharmed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND PfFAD3 transgenic soybean expressing omega\u20103 fatty acid desaturase 3 of Physaria produces increased level of \u03b1\u2010linolenic acid in seed. Composition data of non\u2010transgenic conventional varieties is important in the safety assessment of the genetically\u2010modified (GM) crops in the context of the natural variation. RESULTS The natural variation was characterized in seed composition of 13 Korean soybean varieties grown in three locations in South Korea for 2\u2009years. Univariate analysis of combined data showed significant differences by variety and cultivation environment for proximates, minerals, anti\u2010nutrients, and fatty acids. Percent variability analysis demonstrated that genotype, environment and the interaction of environment with genotype contributed to soybean seed compositions. Principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structure discriminant analysis indicated that significant variance in compositions was attributable to location and cultivation year. The composition of three PfFAD3 soybean lines for proximates, minerals, anti\u2010nutrients, and fatty acids was compared to a non\u2010transgenic commercial comparator (Kwangankong, KA), and three non\u2010transgenic commercial varieties grown at two sites in South Korea. Only linoleic and linolenic acids significantly differed in PfFAD3\u20101 lines compared to KA, which were expected changes by the introduction of the PfFAD3\u20101 trait in KA. CONCLUSION Genotype, environment, and the interaction of environment with genotype contributed to compositional variability in soybean. PfFAD3\u20101 soybean is equivalent to the conventional varieties with respect to these components. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

    "title": "Latest Advancements in Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Technologies in Treating Type 1 Diabetes",
    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune chronic disease characterized by absolute insulin deficiency, which causes abnormal blood glucose regulation. Currently, there are 1.25 million Americans diagnosed with T1D with approximately 64 000 new cases of T1D being diagnosed every year.1,2 There is no cure for T1D and patients with T1D rely on daily insulin administration. So, self-management of T1D is crucial to prevent or delay major complications. However, only a very small proportion of T1D patients have met the target range set by the American Diabetes Association.3 Recent years have witnessed an explosion of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled and data-empowered innovations in treating T1D patients. For instance, closedloop systems (ie, \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d) and insulin pumps are reported to effectively improve T1D management as well as patient outcomes. To summarize the latest research in AI-enabled T1D treatment, we conducted a literature review with PubMed and Google Scholar to retrieve publications in peer-reviewed healthcare journals from January 2019 to May 2020 (see Table 1). Overall, continuous improvements in safety, effectiveness, efficiency, and patient satisfaction using closed-loop systems to control blood glucose level in a broader T1D population (especially pediatric patients) were reported. The newest evidence was derived from various types of studies ranging from well-designed multicenter randomized clinical trial with six-month follow-up on closedloop system to comparative study between real-time and intermittent-scanning continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and to cost-effectiveness study on a hybrid closed-loop system compared with a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion system.4-6 Notably, machine learning techniques applied in CGMs were reported to lead to significant reductions in postprandial hypoglycemia, decreased rates of closed-loop exits and alerts, improved glycemic control without detectable changes in psychosocial outcomes, and accurate prediction and prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Also, the autonomous diagnostic AI system demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing referable diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. Additionally, higher glycated hemoglobin level and workload required to use hybrid closed loop were suggested to be the significant factors associated with discontinuation. In a nutshell, there have been remarkable progress in AI-enabled technology in treating T1D reported in literature since 2019. Yet, practical challenges and opportunities exist. Whether the observed benefits will sustain for prolonged use in real-world settings and how AI technologies will protect patient data privacy and security are crucial questions to address. During the past few years, personalized data, machine learning (in particular, deep learning and convolutional neural network techniques), and realtime adaptive algorithms combined with wearable devices have improved prevention and early detection, clinical decision support, deterioration risk prediction, and patient self-management of T1D. Future research endeavors and technological innovations should meet patients\u2019 needs such as mitigating user\u2019s workload and further enhancing outcomes, optimizing data protection, and realizing patientcentered care. Unquestionably, AI, Big Data, interdisciplinary research, and global collaboration will play an increasingly important role in achieving precision medicine for T1D patients. 949940 DSTXXX10.1177/1932296820949940Journal of Diabetes Science and TechnologyQian et al letter2020",

The entire fifteen listed DMBs in the country as of 31st December, 2017 were focused on and the secondary data were subsequently sourced from the yearly financials of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) for a 29-year period covering from 1989 to 2017. The Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and the Vector Error Correction (VEC) estimation techniques were the basis of estimating the relationship between the variables of interest in this study. Evidence from our analyses indicates that the volume of total deposits and total loans and advances of DMBs have long run negative and statistically significant relationship with DIF. Conversely, the quality of risk assets of DMBs exhibits a positive and insignificant relationship with the target reserve ratio of DMBs. The study thus recommends that regulatory agencies in the banking sector (CBN and NDIC), amongst others, collaborate with listed DMBs to diversify and manage their risk assets by strategically intensifying the implementation of existing measures aimed at minimising incidences of loan default and the alarming levels of non-performing loans in the portfolio of Nigerian DMBs. \u00a9 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada",

    "abstract": "The steady growth of the installed wind power, will reach 600 GW capacity in 2019, together with the up-scaling of the single wind turbine power capability 12 MW\u2019s are announced by manufacturers, has pushed the research and development of power converters towards full scale power conversion, lower cost per kW, higher power density and need for a higher reliability. Substantial efforts are carried out to comply with the more stringent grid codes, especially grid faults ride-through and reactive power injection, which challenges the power converter topologies, because the need for crowbar protection and/or power converter over-rating has been seen in the past in the case of a doubly-fed induction generator. The presentation will first give a technology overview. Next power converter technologies are reviewed with focus on single/multi-cell power converter topologies. Further case studies on the Low Voltage Ride Through demand to power converter are presented including a discussion on reliability. Finally, discussions about topologies for wind farms will be provided where they need to be operating like large power plants like a large synchronous generator. \u201cSENSING TECHNOLOGIES FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING\u201d Er.

Abstract : After more than two decades of research, advanced driver assisted After more than two decades of research, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) are common in many vehicles available in the market. The trend now is to go for fully automated driverless systems. These systems respond to the information provided by a cluster of onboard sensors, and many of them are developed using the latest semiconductor technologies. Such sensors indicate the vehicle state, its environment, and other dynamic driving conditions around the vehicle. The selection and arrangement of sensors play a key role in the design of such a system, and after all, it must be safe to operate. This presentation provides a review of existing, novel, and upcoming sensor technologies, their relation to semiconductor technologies, how to make it cost-effective, and safe to operate. As an example, the details of current and future generation single-chip millimeter-wave radar system architecture and related technology challenges are presented. Finally, a snapshot of the future challenges for sensing technologies and perception are also presented, concluded with an overview of the various technology trends that will show the intention of the market in sensors technologies for sAutomated Vehicles \u201cAUTONOMOUS CONTROL FOR BIPEDAL LOCOMOTION\u201d Dr. Sam K Zachariah graduated in 1987 from College of Engineering, Trivandrum (CET), in Electronics and Communication Engineering and received M.

Since 2010, he has been working as Adjunct Professor in Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), Trivandrum. His current research interests are in the field of mechatronic design and control design of subsystems for humanoid robots. Sam K Zachariah had been awarded the Space Gold Medal in 2006 by the Aerospace society of India for his contributions in the field of launch vehicle actuation systems. Abstract : The talk presents the details on the development of a novel autonomous control framework, called Hybrid-state Driven Autonomous Control (HyDAC) for bipedal locomotion, with special emphesis on the control aspects in sagittal plane. Autonomous control of bipedal locomotion is identified as a challenging problem by the control community due to its multiphase hybrid nature and the unilateral characteristics of ground contact forces. The under actuation during heel and toe centered rolling motions and the intermittent ground impacts introduce additional complexity. In HyDAC, the control synthesis is formulated as a two-level hierarchical control with a hybrid-state based supervisory control in outer level and a coordinated set of constrained motion control primitives, called task level control, in inner level. The supervisory level is designed based on a human inspired heuristic approach whereas the task level control is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints. The explicit analytic solution obtained for joint acceleration and ground contact force is used in turn to generate the joint torque command based on inverse dynamics model of the biped. Unlike many other bipedal control schemes, HyDAC does not require any preplanned trajectory or orbit in terms of joint variables for locomotion control. Moreover, it is built upon a set of basic motion control primitives similar to those in human walk which provides a transparent and easily adaptable structure for the controller. The talk provides illustration of HyDAC to planar bipedal walking over non uniform stair case having arbitrary parameter distribution, justifying it as a potential solution for outdoor walking control.",

    "title": "Road User Attitude and Road Safety",
    "abstract": ": The report from WHO states that, deaths caused by traffic accidents have increased from year to year to reach 1.35 million people. The report also noted that close to 3,700 people die on the world's roads every day and tens of millions more are injured or disabled. Under these conditions, the United Nations then launched the Decade for Road Safety Action 2011-2020. The main objective of this action is to stabilize and reduce the rate of increase in road deaths around the world. Five main pillars of action are recorded in the Global Plan for the Decade of Action, namely, road safety management, safer infrastructure, safer vehicles, safer road user behavior and better post-accident response. The number of accident victims in Indonesia has also increased every year. In 2019, the National Police Traffic Corps stated 32,403 traffic accidents with 6,941 deaths in the first six months of 2019. This paper aims to conduct a literature review on the attitudes of road users and traffic safety in Indonesia and several countries in the world. This paper discusses a review of reports and articles of academic journals and these reports based on database found in Science direct, Research gate, Academia Edu, Google Scholar, newspapers, and related regulations. Finally, this paper will summarize the components of attitudes related to traffic safety, research methods used in papers and theories and models that are widely used as references to determine the causes for certain behavior, especially those related to traffic safety.",

    "abstract": "Background: Survival outcomes in advanced urothelial cancer (UC) is\u00a0dismal. In recent years, immunotherapy remains an evolving treatment modality for those patients. We performed this meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors. \n \nMethods: A systematic literature review was performed through PubMed until October\u00a02020 and a manual review of references. We calculated the pooled objective response rate (ORR), 1-year overall survival (OS) rate and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS)\u00a0rate with 95% confidence intervals\u00a0(95% CI)\u00a0to assess the efficacy of programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1)\u00a0and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)\u00a0inhibitors. Similarly, the summary associations of any-grade and grade\u00a0\u22653 adverse events (AEs) were used to evaluate safety. Heterogeneity across studies was explored through stratified analyses by PD-L1 expression levels, PD-L1\u00a0or PD-1 inhibitors, drugs of study, locations\u00a0of metastasis or primary tumor. Furthermore, sensitivity and publication bias analyses were conducted to\u00a0assess the robustness of\u00a0the association. \n \nResults: Eighteen\u00a0studies comprising 3, 144\u00a0patients were included.\u00a0Overall,\u00a0the summary ORR of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors treatment was 0.20 (95% CI 0.17-0.23). Furthermore, the pooled 1-year OS and 1-year PFS rates were corresponding to 0.43 (95% CI\u00a00.33-0.53)\u00a0and 0.19 (95% CI\u00a00.17-0.21). The summary rates of any-grade and grade\u00a0\u22653 AEs were 0.66\u00a0(95% CI\u00a00.58-0.74)\u00a0and 0.13\u00a0(95% CI\u00a00.09-0.18), respectively. Among the subgroups, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors had encouraging ORR in patients with lymphnode-only metastasis than those with visceral metastasis (0.41 VS. 0.17). Furthermore, the patients with the primary tumor in the lower tract had higher ORR compared with\u00a0those\u00a0with the primary tumor in the upper tract (0.24 VS. 0.15). \n \nConclusion: The immunotherapy showed\u00a0encouraging efficacy and acceptable safety in treating\u00a0advanced UC. Furthermore, our findings provided potential clinical significance for patients with lymphnode-only metastasis or primary tumor in the lower tract. Those exciting findings need further confirmation. \n \nFunding Statement: This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation Committee of China (NSFC 81802941) (F.L.), and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (2018A0303130287) (F.L.) the Outstanding Youth Development Scheme of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University (2019J009) (F.L.), Guangdong Medical Research Fund (CZ2019114 ) (L.N.H), and the Dean's research fund of Nanfang Hospital, the Southern Medical University (2019B008) (L.N.H). \n \nDeclaration of Interests: The authors report no potential conflicts of interest.",

Affected by the novel coronavirus epidemic, policies will be introduced in 2020 to increase the enrollment expansion of masters by 20%. Big data has found that the proportion of enrollment expansion has increased significantly compared with previous years. The large increase in the proportion of enrollment has raised concerns about whether the gold content of master's degree will decline in this era of big data.

    "abstract": "The year is 2022. It is a warm summer day in Boston, and Naomi, an incoming graduate student, sits in a cafe waiting for two colleagues who have greatly influenced her career\u2014although they've never met in person. It was back in 2020 when Naomi, then an undergraduate at Howard University, spent a summer working virtually with Matthias, a postdoc, and Maha, the lab principal investigator, through a Harvard University internship program. Now that the world has managed COVID-19, they are excited to finally meet face-to-face and reflect on that summer experience.\n\n\n\n> \u201cWith a little work, we formed a lasting bond.\u201d \n\nNAOMI: I remember that day in March 2020 when everything seemed to unravel. I was told to evacuate my campus and that classes would be virtual for the indefinite future. While many of my peers' summer research opportunities were canceled, I was lucky that the Harvard summer internship was scheduled to continue virtually. But I wondered how I would learn a completely new topic and research style from 3000 kilometers and two time zones away. How would I form a relationship with my mentors?\n\nMATTHIAS: Both Maha and I had doubts about the virtual internship format. I had never mentored a student completely remotely, and I knew you had never done this type of research before. I counted on Maha's experience mentoring students and her optimism that we would make it work.\n\nNAOMI: The biggest challenge for me was not knowing whether I was on track. If we had been working together in person, it would have been easy to casually touch base and get gentle nudges in the right direction when I needed them. But I was too nervous to ask basic questions over video calls and chat, so I relied on trial and error and online tutorials. Then, when I presented my work to you, I was disappointed to learn that the model I had worked on for 2 weeks was completely wrong.\n\nMAHA: I remember that moment well. It became clear then that we needed to reset our expectations and how we communicated. I urged you to use chat liberally and reach out for more frequent short check-ins. As the days rolled on, you seemed to become more at ease asking for help.\n\nNAOMI: It certainly helped that you were present and responsive via telephone calls and chat. I also learned the importance of making my concerns heard. And when we began to speak more often, I got to see another side of your lives. I never expected to have video calls with Matthias while he was at the playground with his kids!\n\nMATTHIAS: Me neither! Do you remember when my daughter poured water on my laptop? It delayed me terribly in sending over a key figure for your final presentation. I was balancing so much at the time and yet desperately wanted to be there when you needed me.\n\nNAOMI: Yes, that wasn't the smoothest moment\u2014but ultimately it only strengthened our relationship. Seeing your struggles with working from home helped me realize that we are all human, navigating through a difficult time together.\n\nMATTHIAS: I enjoyed connecting with you informally; it felt very genuine. It also offered an opportunity to reflect on what kind of mentor I want to be in the \u201creal\u201d world. I hope to carry that forward with me.\n\nMAHA: Losing the connection with mentees was among the hardest aspects of the quarantine for me professionally. Shifting to a more relaxed communication style really helped. It also reinforced my belief that science and scientists should be less aloof and more welcoming, especially to aspiring scientists early in their careers.\n\nNAOMI: The virtual environment made it hard to connect at times\u2014but with a little work, we formed a lasting bond.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. The current long-term decline in the level of Russian school mathematics education is confirmed by the international research, the results of the international mathematical Olympiads for schoolchildren, the results of school final exams and university admission tests, and the unsatisfactory quality of training of first-year students. Teachers-mathematicians and many scientists tend to associate the lack of students\u2019 mathematical knowledge with the introduction of the Unified State Exam (USE or EGE \u2013 high school final and university entrance exam taken upon completion of the 11th form) in Russia. The aims of the present research are the following: to identify the patterns in inter-annual changes in the assignments of the EGE in mathematics and to discuss the content and results of this exam for the last 15 years through the example of school graduates\u2019 certification in the Omsk region. Methodology and research methods. The research was carried out on the basis of a systematic approach, using statistical and comparative retrospective analysis methods. Results and scientific novelty. The authors of the current publication examined the dynamics of transformation of the content of the final school exam in \u00a9 \u0410. \u0421. \u041a\u043e\u0442\u044e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u0415. \u0418. \u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0412. \u0411. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432, \u042e. \u0411. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430. \u0422\u043e\u043c 22, No 5. 2020/The Education and Science Journal. Vol. 22, No 5. 2020 10 mathematics after the introduction of the EGE, evolution/involution of the tasks included in the exam and the influence of these processes and the proposed control and measuring materials (KIMs) on the quality of mathematical knowledge of potential university students. The attention of the authors was focused primarily on the assignments of the EGE, which require detailed, informed solutions and answers (the assignments, which were combined in tests before 2015 under the title \u201cPart C\u201d). The comparison of similar tasks at the traditional final examination at secondary school in 2000 and the written entrance examination of one of the Omsk universities of the same year with the assignments of the specialised EGE2019 allowed the authors to reveal strong negative tendencies in mathematical training of schoolchildren. The graduates of general education institutions demonstrate the same modest gains in the EGE algebraic tasks from year to year. Although, the tasks are permanently simplified and do not differ in variety. On the contrary, geometric tasks are brought to a high-level, and, therefore, such tasks are not well solved by examinees. However, due to the non-linear rating scale, it is not necessary to do these tasks, as well as some other tasks involving a detailed solution. Without completing such tasks, it is now quite feasible for many students to get the certain number of points to enroll in the university, where the specialised EGE in mathematics is accepted as an entrance exam. But even a significant reduction of the level of assessment of satisfactory knowledge without good teachers, a carefully designed school curriculum and quality textbooks do not give rural school graduates a chance to obtain higher education and move up the social ladder. Practical significance. The results of this research can be used by the authors of KIMs to change and update the assignments of the Unified State Exam, and also by school teachers, lecturers at the courses and methodologists to change the focus of training.",

    "abstract": "Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) is a new satellite of measuring concentrations of carbon, can also provide comparatively higher resolution Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) data which has the potential to directly estimate the photosynthetic activity or gross primary production (GPP). The aim of the present study is to investigate the feasibility of using OCO-2 derived SIF data for the estimation of photosynthetic activity in Bangladesh. To verify the OCO-2 derived SIF data, the present study analyzes the relationship between OCO-2 derived SIF and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived GPP for different land cover types for the year 2015 using individual day pixel-based analysis. The relationship between SIF and GPP is found to be good for the mixed vegetation for the data accessed on 01 January and 02 February of 2015 and for the evergreen forest for the data accessed on 14 September of 2015. In contrast, the relationship is not found strong between SIF and GPP for most of the cases. The pixel-based spatial dissimilarity between OCO-2 and MODIS, and spatial distortions of OCO-2 footprints might be the possible reason behind the poor correlation between SIF and GPP found in the present study. Unavailability of the homogeneous OCO-2 derived SIF data in terms of spatial and temporal context is another possible reason behind the weak relationship between SIF and GPP. The sparse spatial coverage and poor relationship to the MODIS derived GPP data declines the reliability of OCO-2 derived SIF data for the estimation of photosynthetic activity in Bangladesh or in other local scale application. \nJournal of Engineering Science 11(2), 2020, 133-140",

    "title": "A Study on Customer Satisfaction in E-retailing With Special Reference to Consumer Electronics and Appliances: An Analytical Research on Indian Perspective",
    "abstract": "The e-retailing is accelerating towards excellence with ever-evolving trends and an escalating number of e- shoppers every year. About 67% of the people with utmost buying power in our society prefer e- shopping. India has been going through a digital revolution during the last five years, which is transforming the consumer shopping experience, at a different level. The evolving consumer preferences, rising disposable income, increasing usage of smart phones, and extensive exposure to digital media are significantly impacting the Indian retail market dynamics. It is expected that, E-Commerce in India will surpass INR 2,000 billion by 2025, with consumer electronics being one of its key drivers. India\u2019s demographic profile has undergone a characteristic evolution. GenY, the working-age population, working women, and the Indian middle-class, have evolved to be the most influential segments of the population triggering new social, technological, and economic trends. Urbanization will also affect the market, such that 64% of the total Indian population will be urbanized by 2025, and cities will account for 70% of India\u2019s GDP by 2030. Urban planning initiatives, such as development of mega cities and mega regions, and the more recent smart cities initiatives are considered as enablers for a higher rate of urbanization. Consumer electronics and appliances market in India is expected to reach approximately $30 billion by 2020. The penetration of online retail in electronics and appliances sales was around 3-5% in 2016, and it is expected to reach around 20-25% by 2020. This translates to the online retailing in electronics increasing at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 75%, during 2016 to 2020. \n \nWith the ever expanding internet access and greater preference to shop online, it is expected that, the landscape of Indian consumer electronics will transform in the next five years. It is extremely important that, the consumer electronics and appliances companies acknowledge this change, and start redefining their retail strategies, in order to benefit in the long run. Consumer electronics and appliances companies have been pushing products in the market, through several initiatives, such as bundled offers, discounts and aggressive pricing. However, it is the time to reinvent the wheel, as the consumers are more inclined towards buying high involvement consumer electronics products online. This transition has happened over the last 2-3 years, as there are multiple e-commerce platforms, combined with the growing preference for convenience offered by online shopping over traditional retail stores. \n \nConsumers are also becoming extremely intelligent these days, where they survey models in a brick-and-mortar retail outlet, and compare the prices with the online portals. In our country, price is still the top-most factor driving purchase, and the consumers would buy it from the medium that offers it at the lowest price. In case of consumer electronics companies, who plan and run promotional campaigns around the festive seasons, online e-commerce players run these on a monthly basis, as they can easily play with the extra margins that they have, due to elimination of stakeholders in the value chain. In addition to factors such as comparison of multiple products, online market places have a lot of schemes using multiple payment channels, that provide additional cashbacks and discounts. Growth of mobile internet users will be one of the key reasons for driving growth in this channel, covering more than 300 million users in India, in the next few years. With increasing network infrastructure development and usage of wireless technologies such as 3G and 4G, overall internet user base in India is expected to be 600 million in 2020, which accounts for 27% penetration. \n \nConsumer electronics and appliances companies have been strategizing for the last three years to reap the benefits of the online retailing channel. Dedicated digital sales and marketing teams have been set up by certain leading consumer appliance players, while some others are tieing up with ecommerce players to push their products. Companies also focus on hyperlocal strategies of partnership with the leading e-commerce market places such as Flipkart and Amazon, where they are able to directly provide the product to the customer through the nearest or branded stores in the vicinity. This helps them in ensuring that the competitive pricing is maintained, while the dealers are also able to push their products through alternate channels. Online marketplaces provide additional services to their partners to track and push products online. They provide solutions, that help sellers in case of inventory and order management, as well as conduct in-depth analysis of sales trends. This enables sellers to strategize on how to improve their product line, as well as their marketing strategy. \n \nDuring the festive season in 2016, it was observed that approximately 25% of LED television sales, 8-10% of washing machines, refrigerators and air-conditioners, and 30% of microwaves sales were contributed through the online channel. The e-commerce retailers offer most products at discounted rates, which none of the physical stores can match. There is also the additional benefit of the retailers providing services in more than 100 cities in India, which helps customers to access their preferred brands. \n \nNumber of previous researches in this area has been reviewed to identify whether there is any research gap or scope for further research: \nElliot and Fowell (2000) stated that, the different levels of online buying intensity are not significantly related to the intensity of internet usage among the customers. The finding reveals, high intensity internet usage does not associate with high intensity online buying which confirms the fact that, the customers use internet for other purposes predominantly, and online buying activity is a supplementary utility exploited through the internet. Park and Kim (2003) asserted that, the e-retailing enterprises should identify the means to convert low and medium intensity online buyers into high intensity online buyers. Such enterprise can incorporate real-time online support in the form of live chat systems to the customers through their e-commerce portals as suggested by the authors, and enhanced service quality would be the differentiating factor among the competitors in future e-markets. Korgaonkar et al. (2006) opined that, the online retailers need to either establish a strong presence, or perish by the popularity of competitors in the long run. The authors also stated that, all the products and services are not equally popular among the customers. The findings of the study revealed that, the customers prefer the online mode of purchase, only for few product categories. For rest of the products, the customers\u201f preferences are inclined more towards the physical mode of purchase. Hernandez et al. (2011) found that, the income levels of the customers are significantly associated with their intensity of online purchase. The authors indicated that, the medium income group customers are more active in exploiting the price advantages for the products offered through online retailer. Bhowmik (2012) opined that, internet has opened up a new possibility for trade and commerce with an increased ability of the sellers to push product beyond the boundary of specific market. While explaining the nature of e-commerce adoption in small and medium enterprises in Bangladesh, the details of the various government level supports towards e-commerce growth and development is well explained in this study. Niranjanamurthy et al. (2013) subdivided e-commerce into three categories such as, business-to-business or B2B (Cisco), business-to-consumer or B2C (Amazon), and consumer-to-consumer or C2C (eBay). Further, the above study listed the advantages of mobile commerce systems in line with each category of e-commerce systems, where it is reported that the security issues like computer security, data security and other wider realms of the information security framework affects the confidence levels of the end users, while reaping the benefits of these systems. The authors also raised concerns over the limitations and security issues of e-commerce. \n \nThese aforesaid studies stimulate the researchers to proceed further in this area. So a comprehensive research is executed on two e-commerce giants operating in India. Starting with their sales-assets and income trends, a time series forecasting has been incorporated. Further, a primary research is performed to identify the most significant factor in online retailing of electronics appliances with respect to their Customer Satisfaction in E-Retailing and to check whether there is any association between these independent variable with the dependent variable. Then, those two companies are compared on the basis of those important factors; and lastly with respect to the impact of the independent variables on the customer satisfaction. For this purpose, secondary data are collected from CMIE Prowess. On the other hand, 200 respondents are surveyed with the help of a questionnaire containing 15 parameters. Time Series forecasting followed by Reliability test, Factor Analysis, Pearson Chi-Square test, Rank Analysis and Multiple Regression Analysis are performed to analyze the data set. From the findings of the study, a model is to be established for enhancing Customer Satisfaction in E-Retailing of electronics appliances. The research is significant from management perspective, as it suggests those components of E-Customer Satisfaction to the marketers, where they should concentrate upon to thrive in service perception.",

    "title": "A Scientometric Analysis: Finance and Investors under the Context of Internet Development",
    "abstract": "Providing services via Internet technology is increasingly popular, and the financial sector is no exception. As a part of the modern service industry, finance has developed rapidly in the Internet world, provoking researchers to study the effects of finance and investor on various dimensions of the societal life. Although many studies have analyzed the impact of the Internet on finance, few of them have mentioned the investors, such as their attention, sentiment and attitudes. Based on the 481 articles retrieved by Web of Science, this paper makes a systematic review, which can provide a direction for future research and make up the research gap. Research papers published between 1989 and 2020 were selected and grouped according to publication year, institutions and publication sources. The results showed that in recent years, the publishing industry in various countries developed rapidly, and the research fields involved finance, management, economics, organizational law, business, and other disciplines. Also, U.S. and Chinese institutions excel at hosting such interdisciplinary work. In addition, different types of keywords present significant interactions in the visualization: (a) internet-based research, (b) financial markets and investors, (c) social media and big data, (d) internet of things and block chain, and (e) trust.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus\nBy the end of July 2020, Kenya h ad reported only 341 deaths and \u223c20,000 cases of COVID-19. This is in marked contrast to the tens of thousands of deaths reported in many higher-income countries. The true extent of COVID-19 in the community was unknown and likely to be higher than reports indicated. Uyoga et al. found an overall seroprevalence among blood donors of 4.3%, peaking in 35- to 44-year-old individuals (see the Perspective by Maeda and Nkengasong). The low mortality can be partly explained by the steep demographics in Kenya, where less than 4% of the population is 65 or older. These circumstances combine to result in Kenyan hospitals not currently being overwhelmed by patients with respiratory distress. However, the imposition of a strict lockdown in this country has shifted the disease burden to maternal and child deaths as a result of disruption to essential medical services.\n\nScience , this issue p.

    "abstract": "\u201cSummer is on its way and my partner and I managed to grow this rose which has a wonderful scent.\u201d A picture of a beautiful orange flower accompanied the note\u2014part of a weekly email sharing good news with the members of our research center. One year ago, an announcement like this could have seemed insignificant and irrelevant to the important work of science. But amid the difficulties of 2020, it was anything but. It put a smile on my face, and hopefully it did the same for my colleagues. It helped build human connection. And it reminded us that, even this year, good things happened.\n\n\n\n> \u201cHighlighting the positive moments \u2026 helped keep our spirits up.\u201d \n\nLast year, the director of the research center in Australia where I serve as the business strategy manager asked me to help maintain a positive, productive culture. Back then, I didn't anticipate that the task was going to be so difficult. Then, of course, came 2020.\n\nDuring the first half of the year, Australia experienced an extreme drought followed by devastating bushfires and heavy rainfall that brought massive flooding. Next came the pandemic. With people not coming in to the lab or staying only long enough to conduct their experiments, we lost our sense of interpersonal connection. Then, in July, our director shared that she had been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer.\n\nIn the wake of that devastating announcement, one of the center's group leaders suggested we send our director weekly good news to keep her informed and to try to lift her spirits. One week later, we sent the first email. The rule was that no good news was too small to share. We reported the arrival of much-needed new computers for one lab, one of our group leaders being contacted by a journalist for their expert opinion on viruses in the context of the pandemic, a student submitting their thesis, a paper being published, and a group leader securing child care spots for their children.\n\nThe effect of this simple newsletter\u2014which went to all the group leaders as well as our director\u2014was profound. Many people responded, saying they enjoyed this informal venue for learning about their colleagues' successes. The flood of negative news had kept us from noticing the good things that were happening. Highlighting the positive moments didn't mean we were ignoring the larger catastrophes, but it helped keep our spirits up. I also realized that, prior to the newsletter, some group members didn't know about others' successes. Sharing these updates more publicly gave everyone a boost. After a few weeks, we decided to broaden the recipient list to include everyone at the center.\n\nThese days, we solicit good news every Wednesday and send out an email every Friday. The process and format are simple and no-frills, making the newsletter sustainable. At first I worried that people might be hesitant to share updates that seemed too insignificant, but the opposite has been true; they have been eager to highlight their endeavors and successes, big and small, professional and personal. Good news we've shared includes securing grants and fellowships, publishing papers, becoming parents, turning 40, and\u2014of course\u2014growing roses on one's balcony. \u201cI love good news time,\u201d a colleague wrote after a recent email. \u201cIt really is uplifting.\u201d\n\nLast month, one group leader's good news was that, after breaking his arm, he finally had his cast removed. The next week, he reported that his daughter broke her arm and offered the tongue-in-cheek hypothesis that the number of broken bones in his family is a conserved quantity. It wasn't exactly good news, but the joke made me chuckle. Equally important, it's personal news, and sharing it helps us stay connected in these difficult times.\n\nWith 2020 drawing to a close, we can hope for better things in 2021. But regardless of what the future holds, we plan to continue to share our good news.",

The simulator is the outcome of six cycles; in each cycle, a proof of concept with additional features is created. Each cycle finishes with evaluation and improvement suggestions.Results: The simulator has been tested with students and results have been promising. The interview simulator understands context-free questions, retrieving the right information related to RE concepts such as goals, tasks, users, benefits, and constraints. The simulator also answers questions based on the context, makes summaries of the conversation, responds to meta-questions, and adds ambiguity and incompleteness to the conversation.Conclusions: The results have been promising. The simulator has been tested with degree and master level students. They were able to create a requirements specification using the simulator, and the feedback has been generally positive. The simulator will be tested in a real RE course in the academic year 2020\u20132021. Once it proves effective in the classroom, it will be opened to the RE community for free use and improvement.",

    "abstract": "An important driving force for the development of enterprises during technological innovation. With the continuous development of high-tech and high-tech industries, it can create considerable economic benefits for the region and the country. To this end, local governments at all levels need to attach great importance to the innovation and development of high-tech enterprises in the region, and support economic policies in terms of key technological innovations. Venture capital has become widespread in China's investment industry this year. Venture capital has played a positive role in promoting high-tech development in enterprises. In view of this, this article focuses on the three dimensions of the overview of venture capital and innovation of high-tech enterprises, the analysis of the impact of venture capital on high-tech enterprises, and the research on the countermeasures of venture capital of technology centers in high-tech enterprises. Science and technology are the primary driving force for the country's economic development, and innovation is the undefeated factor for enterprises to achieve long-term development. Technological innovation is the only constant source of the slow road to economic growth. Countries all over the world attach great importance to technological innovation and place technological innovation at a new level of national strategy. Especially in many fields such as national defense, biomedicine, electronic information, military, aerospace science and technology, technological innovation is a long and complicated process, which has become an important support for competition and competition between countries. The scientific and technological achievements have undergone a long process from the generation of ideas to the practice of innovation. In many developed countries, huge investments are made in high-tech every year. Technological innovation is a typical high-risk and high-benefit industry. Once the capital investment is successful, it will be accompanied by high returns. On the contrary, it takes a long time to consume, and funding shortage becomes a bottleneck for the development of technological innovation. 1. Overview of Venture Capital and Innovation of High-Tech Enterprises 1.1 Overview of Venture Capital Venture capital is usually linked to high risk, indicating that investors are willing to take on innovation risks and intend to participate in entrepreneurial behaviors or innovation activities. The GEM is called \"New Venture\" in many companies. In many technological innovation companies, their business direction is the economic pursuit of obtaining high returns in high-risk entrepreneurial activities. It is hereby emphasized that the entrepreneurial enterprises have high growth, do not have Investors' investment behavior is not holding, but through the management and operation of funds, enabling enterprises to increase capital and increase capital through technological innovation. An investment behavior that expects enterprises to develop in key technology and high-tech fields after harvesting and reap long-term benefits [1].listing qualifications, and innovative content is still being conceived. 1.2 The Definition of High-Tech Enterprises Compared with traditional enterprises, high-tech enterprises have higher growth. Technology is a powerful driving force in the development of high-tech industries. It is a business activity based on 2020 Conference on Economics and Management (CEAM2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000532 ISBN: 978-1-80052-002-8 -475continuous research and transformation of technological achievements. In China, high-tech enterprises belong to knowledge-intensive and technology-intensive industries. High-tech enterprises have formed their core intellectual property rights in the process of continuous development, and have been issued by the State in the \"high-tech fields supported by the state\", Innovation is the driving force for the sustainable development of high-tech enterprises. By following the development path of industrial structure adjustment, independent innovation, and continuous technological innovation, the company's scientific and technological creative power is enhanced. In recent years, with the support of national policies, high-tech industries have settled in cities with concentrated graduation resources, relying on the local government's investment promotion policy and financial support to promote the high-tech industry into industrialized operations [2]. Fig1 . High-Tech Enterprises 2. Analysis of the Impact of Venture Capital on High-Tech Enterprises For traditional financial investment, venture capital is an update of concepts. In the past, financial investment was mainly focused on cash flow, while venture capital paid more attention to the business capabilities of investment managers, related technologies, and the prospect of company development. Grasping the development trend of the macro environment and realizing strategic transformation are of great significance to the long-term development of high-tech enterprises in obtaining venture capital investment. With the rapid development of the market economy in the future, venture capital will face greater challenges and development opportunities. 2.1Positive Impact of Venture Capital on High-Tech Enterprises High-tech enterprises are divided into several stages in the innovation process, and the implementation of each stage requires financial support. To this end, venture capital provides strong support and capital filling in the development of various new technologies. While continuously improving the innovation capabilities of high-tech enterprises, it is possible to provide technological innovation from a bold idea to an applied reality [3]. First of all, venture capital provides financial support for high-tech enterprises. The need for funds in the process of technological innovation has gradually increased. The shortage of funds will put high-tech research into trouble. Venture capital as an effective financing channel in the short term is a technology Support for innovation launch. Venture capital has played a significant role in supporting and promoting the development of China's high-tech industries. From the central government to local governments to the whole society, the development of the venture capital industry has been highly valued. Local governments have begun to actively explore the path of",

    "abstract": "The Electron Loss and Fields Investigation with a Spatio-Temporal Ambiguity-Resolving option (ELFIN-STAR, or heretoforth simply: ELFIN) mission comprises two identical 3-Unit (3U) CubeSats on a polar (\u223c93\u2218 inclination), nearly circular, low-Earth (\u223c450 km altitude) orbit. Launched on September 15, 2018, ELFIN is expected to have a >2.5 year lifetime. Its primary science objective is to resolve the mechanism of storm-time relativistic electron precipitation, for which electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are a prime candidate. From its ionospheric vantage point, ELFIN uses its unique pitch-angle-resolving capability to determine whether measured relativistic electron pitch-angle and energy spectra within the loss cone bear the characteristic signatures of scattering by EMIC waves or whether such scattering may be due to other processes. Pairing identical ELFIN satellites with slowly-variable along-track separation allows disambiguation of spatial and temporal evolution of the precipitation over minutes-to-tens-of-minutes timescales, faster than the orbit period of a single low-altitude satellite (Torbit \u223c 90 min). Each satellite carries an energetic particle detector for electrons (EPDE) that measures 50 keV to 5 MeV electrons with \u0394\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$\\Delta $\\end{document}E/E < 40% and a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) on a \u223c72 cm boom that measures magnetic field waves (e.g., EMIC waves) in the range from DC to 5 Hz Nyquist (nominally) with <0.3 nT/sqrt(Hz) noise at 1 Hz. The spinning satellites (Tspin\u223c\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$\\,\\sim $\\end{document}3 s) are equipped with magnetorquers (air coils) that permit spin-up or -down and reorientation maneuvers. Using those, the spin axis is placed normal to the orbit plane (nominally), allowing full pitch-angle resolution twice per spin. An energetic particle detector for ions (EPDI) measures 250 keV \u2013 5 MeV ions, addressing secondary science. Funded initially by CalSpace and the University Nanosat Program, ELFIN was selected for flight with joint support from NSF and NASA between 2014 and 2018 and launched by the ELaNa XVIII program on a Delta II rocket (with IceSatII as the primary). Mission operations are currently funded by NASA. Working under experienced UCLA mentors, with advice from The Aerospace Corporation and NASA personnel, more than 250 undergraduates have matured the ELFIN implementation strategy; developed the instruments, satellite, and ground systems and operate the two satellites. ELFIN\u2019s already high potential for cutting-edge science return is compounded by concurrent equatorial Heliophysics missions (THEMIS, Arase, Van Allen Probes, MMS) and ground stations. ELFIN\u2019s integrated data analysis approach, rapid dissemination strategies via the SPace Environment Data Analysis System (SPEDAS), and data coordination with the Heliophysics/Geospace System Observatory (H/GSO) optimize science yield, enabling the widest community benefits. Several storm-time events have already been captured and are presented herein to demonstrate ELFIN\u2019s data analysis methods and potential. These form the basis of on-going studies to resolve the primary mission science objective. Broad energy precipitation events, precipitation bands, and microbursts, clearly seen both at dawn and dusk, extend from tens of keV to >1 MeV. This broad energy range of precipitation indicates that multiple waves are providing scattering concurrently. Many observed events show significant backscattered fluxes, which in the past were hard to resolve by equatorial spacecraft or non-pitch-angle-resolving ionospheric missions. These observations suggest that the ionosphere plays a significant role in modifying magnetospheric electron fluxes and wave-particle interactions. Routine data captures starting in February 2020 and lasting for at least another year, approximately the remainder of the mission lifetime, are expected to provide a very rich dataset to address questions even beyond the primary mission science objective.",

On this occasion, I would like to congratulate all members of our Journal Board, reviewers (their names are listed at the end of this greeting), authors, and readers with this date!\n Year 2021 was quite challenging again to everybody and to our Journal as well due to continuous spreading of the coronavirus around the world, quarantine measures, working from home, etc. Also, unfortunately, many nuclear-engineering / radiation-science conferences were cancelled, moved to next year, or conducted virtually. Therefore, we would like to invite authors from these conferences to submit their augmented and revised papers to our Journal with the objective to publish as soon as possible their valuable research / technical results.\n We pay special attention to papers from young scientists, researchers, engineers, and students to be sure that we will have smooth transition from one generation of nuclear experts to another. As such, in addition to regular papers from young specialists, we have managed to prepare a Special Issue (SI) with selected papers from the International Youth Nuclear Congress (IYNC) 2020 (Sydney, Australia), and plan to have several similar SIs in the near future.\n During our seventh year, we have published four issues electronically and as hard copies (as planned, always on time or ahead of a schedule) with about 100 papers including two Special Issues with selected augmented and revised papers.",

    "abstract": "There is a great influence of irrigated land of an area to the acreage and productions of agricultural crops and thus maintain the food security. Recent awareness about climate change and its impacts on global environmental challenges has drawn the great attention on rational and sustainable handling of irrigation resources and its networks. As one of the cutting-edge technologies remote sensing data and geographical information system (GIS) are very much useful for efficient management of irrigation networks and optimum utilization of irrigation schemes for the sustainable agricultural development. Irrigation potentiality is the total area which can be irrigated from a project on its full utilization. This implies that an area where water is available for irrigation in each season during a complete irrigation year. In the present study an attempt has been made to investigate the irrigation potentiality of an area using remote sensing data as primary source and field data and as well as ground water level data from secondary source. Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data of 2016 and 2017 have been used for this purpose. Existing irrigation system has also been identified through the investigation of natural and artificial sources of irrigation water of the study area. Seasonal irrigated area was also monitored during the crop growing season. Ground water level fluctuation was also studied using ancillary data. \nJournal of Engineering Science 11(2), 2020, 141-148",

    "title": "Preliminary Results on the Growth of Larval European Lobster (Homarus gammarus (Linneaus, 1758)) in Turkey",
    "abstract": "Sea lobsters are among the most valuable seafood traded commodities. Since its production with fishing has decreased every year in the world, many types of cultural studies have been carried out and success has been achieved. The aim of this research is to investigate the survival of European lobster (Homarus gammarus) larvae in Turkey and to determine the nature of the direction of growth opportunities. This research is the first study in Turkey investigating the nature of the direction of growth opportunities and the survival of European lobster larvae. Larval release, larvae feeding and survival possibilities were investigated on two egg-bearing lobsters obtained from \u00c7anakkale coasts. Both broodstock larvae were able to survive until the post larval stage. The larvae of the first mature lobster reached 10.857 mm total length and 0.025 g live weight after approximately 30 days. The larvae of the second mature lobster reached 26.9 mm total length and 0.502 g live weight after 33 days. A significant difference was found in the larvae of two mature lobsters at the end of the experiment according to their initial dimensions in both length and weight (p <0.05). In addition, it was determined that the growth was higher due to the higher temperature in the larvae of the second mature lobster.

    "title": "Software Sense: Making the Case for the Long-Term View",
    "abstract": "Beth Collins, CFO of Software Sense, an American multinational computer hardware and software developer, contemplated various ways that her publicly traded company could embrace a more long-term orientation in its quarterly reports and throughout its reporting ecosystem. Like other publicly traded companies, Software Sense faced constant pressure from investors and analysts to increase short-term financial-performance metrics, particularly in its quarterly earnings calls. Many in business were concerned about the deleterious effects of short-termism, which referred to the practice of focusing on short-term rather than long-term performance and results; these effects included less attention paid to long-term value creation and innovation, strategy, and fundamentals; less R&D investment; and the implementation of high-risk strategies that could threaten the company&#39;s health. Recently, Collins had read about and heard presentations by Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose (CECP), an initiative encouraging business leaders to reframe investor calls away from short-term reporting and toward a more long-term strategic approach and orientation. As she researched CECP's recommendations and strategies, Collins could see the benefits of this approach\u2014but also the potential problems. Excerpt UVA-E-0436 Rev. May 29, 2020 Software Sense: Making the Case for the Long-Term View Beth Collins, CFO of Software Sense, stared at her computer screen, trying to gather her thoughts about the upcoming meeting with other top-level management, including the company's CEO. Like many other public companies, Software Sense faced constant pressure from investors and analysts to increase short-term financial-performance metrics. Like most other public companies, Software Sense held quarterly earnings calls that outlined company performance. However, Collins and other management had long chafed at having to prove the company's worth four times a year and thought the focus on short-term reporting and results was hurting not only Software Sense but other major companies and capital markets in general. Recently, Collins had read about and heard presentations by Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose (CECP), an initiative encouraging business leaders to reframe investor calls away from short-term reporting and toward a more long-term strategic approach and orientation. Collins could see the benefits\u2014as well as the concerns\u2014of this approach, but she anticipated pushback from others on the management team. At the end of the week, she needed to be ready to present her case for Software Sense embracing a more long-term orientation in its quarterly reports and throughout its reporting ecosystem. Software Sense Software Sense, an American multinational computer hardware and software developer specializing in database-management systems and cloud computing for businesses, was based in Spokane, Washington. Founded in the early 1990s, Software Sense had gone public in 1996, and despite some ups and downs over the years, the share price had fared well. In addition to selling database software and technology, Software Sense specialized in enterprise software products (including its own brands of database-management systems) and cloud-engineered systems. In 2019, Software Sense was the eighth-largest software company by revenue, with a market value of $ 1.8billion. See Exhibit 1 for financial data and Exhibit 2 for stock history. . . .",

Therefore, in the teaching of higher mathematics, how to deal with the relationship between knowledge and ability is very important, not only to teach students the basic theoretical knowledge, but also to guide students through the integration of knowledge and systematic analysis to solve professional problems. This paper firstly expounds the current teaching situation of higher mathematics in colleges, and then puts forward methods and strategies to improve colleges' ability to practice mathematics in order to improve college students' ability to apply mathematics. Introduction With the rapid development of computer technology, the mathematical technology developed in harmony with it has also been profoundly affected; At the same time, the development of mathematics has provided a powerful impetus for the development of high technology. In the process of solving practical problems, mathematics plays an irreplaceable role in other disciplines. It is based on this feature that each college student puts forward higher requirements, that is, the basis for mastering the basic principles and professional knowledge of higher mathematics. In the past, the application of mathematics to solving practical problems is aimed at improving the students' ability in practical application of mathematics. higher mathematics is a highly applicable discipline, which plays an advantage that other disciplines cannot match when solving practical problems in real life. However, when college set up higher mathematics teaching, it often only paid attention to the theoretical, rigorous, and test-oriented nature of mathematics, and ignored the cultivation of students' practical application of mathematics. Such teaching concepts and teaching methods are in line with the application-oriented talents required by the current society Divergence. Higher mathematics can train students 'logical thinking ability and ability to analyze problems. Therefore, College teachers should focus on cultivating students' ability to apply mathematics, and treat advanced mathematics as a basic compulsory course for new students, laying a foundation for the later professional courses. This paper will combine the current situation of developing students' mathematical application ability with higher mathematics teaching, analyze the reasons for students' poor mathematical application ability, and focus on how to strengthen higher mathematics teaching, improve the teaching structure, and effectively cultivate students' application ability. 1. The Status Quo of College Students' Application of Higher Mathematics In recent years, many colleges have begun to expand enrollment, and the gap between students has become wider and wider. By investigating the current teaching status of several college higher mathematics, now, some students have a slack mentality in the study of high numbers; don\u2019t pay attention to the study of mathematics content, and only deal with daily learning and examinations for graduation. In addition, sophomores and juniors in universities attach great importance to practice and arrange most of the basic theoretical courses in the freshman year. Therefore, the 2020 Conference on Educational Science and Educational Skills (ESES2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000636 ISBN: 978-1-80052-003-5 -468curriculum is very compact. Teachers only pay attention to the knowledge that should be given to students within the prescribed time. In a short time, it neglected the cultivation of students' thinking ability and independent thinking ability, which affected the future development of students. In many colleges, students are susceptible to the deep-rooted influence of teachers. They follow the teacher's problem-solving ideas and thinking methods, and do various exercises to meet the needs of the exam. They do not really learn the essence of mathematical knowledge and hinder the cultivation of student logic thinking ability and independent thinking ability also restrict students 'ability to apply higher mathematics to real life. Therefore, teachers in higher schools must first improve their own qualities in order to cultivate students' ability to apply mathematics [1-5]. 2. The Relationship between College Students' Mathematical Application Ability and Higher Mathematics Teaching Mathematical application ability is a very complex cognitive skill. It is analyzed from its psychological representation. Basic mathematical cognitive operations include mathematical abstraction, logical reasoning, and modeling. Therefore, the basic components of mathematical application ability are mathematical abstraction ability, logical reasoning ability, and mathematical modeling ability. Complex mathematical application abilities consist of them. For example, mathematical proof ability and mathematical calculation ability are composed of a series of logical reasoning. In the process of solving practical problems, it is often necessary to comprehensively use a variety of different basic knowledge operations to complete. In college, the growth of mathematical knowledge and the enhancement of mathematical application ability of students outside the major of mathematics are realized through the teaching of higher mathematics. From this we can draw the following important conclusions: In the teaching of higher mathematics, in order to strengthen the cultivation of students' mathematical application ability, there are two \"must do\"[6-8]. First, we must attach importance to knowledge transfer and construct an optimized and practical knowledge structure of higher mathematics, which is the basis for the cultivation of applied ability. Second, we must strengthen the practice, which is a necessary way to strengthen students' ability to apply mathematics. They are the keys to strengthening students' ability to apply mathematics. The relationship between college students' mathematical application ability and higher mathematics teaching is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Cognition of the relationship between college students' mathematical application ability and higher mathematics teaching Nowadays, when higher education enters the stage of popularization, as mentioned in the introduction, in the local common college, especially in ordinary colleges, due to the sharp increase in the number of students, a considerable number of students have poor mathematical foundation. In the teaching of higher mathematics, the phenomenon of neglecting capacity-building has intensified, and the reduction of heuristics has seriously affected the functioning of capacity-building. This practice of weakening ability training to increase knowledge transmission is contrary to the law of cognition. It will only make students rote, memorize, and worsen their ability, which is not in line with the educational goals of education. Therefore, how to properly handle the relationship between imparting knowledge and cultivating ability, and strengthening the cultivation of students' ability to 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Strong Stronger general weak Weaker Learning ability",

    "title": "Introducing Middle School Students to Programmable Sensor Technologies Through an Immersive Experience",
    "abstract": "Integrating computational thinking into middle school science classes through the use of programmable sensor technologies requires that students are familiar with the sensors and how the sensors can help them figure out the answers to their scientific questions. However current best practice in science education integrates science content and scientific practices (i.e. planning an investigation using the sensors) instead of teaching the practices first. In addition, the goal is to have the students recognize that the sensors would be useful for answering their current questions. To address this issue, I collaboratively designed a week long sensor immersion experience with middle school science teachers as part of a larger design based implementation research project that creates middle school science units that integrate computational thinking using these sensors. Through our observations and reflections with teachers, the necessity of a unit that introduces the students to the sensors became apparent. Working with the teachers, we developed a sensor immersion experience centered around the investigation of a classroom data display that illustrates information about the classroom environment using lights and sound. The data display was constructed using the programmable sensor technologies available to the students and the unit involved them creating and refining a model of how the classroom data display worked. This unit was implemented during the first three months of the 2019/2020 school year and preliminary results suggest that students have a better sense of the capabilities of the sensors and how they can help them in their scientific inquiry.",

    "abstract": "\u00a9American Political Science Association, 2020 Highlights from APSA\u2019s 16th Teaching & Learning Conference APSA held its 16th Teaching & Learning Conference (TLC) from February 7\u20139, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The program committee, led by co-chairs Sara Parker (Chabot College) and Shane Nordyke (University of South Dakota) organized a dynamic program of track sessions and workshops around the theme \u201cTeaching to Empower Students.\u201d The program opened with a keynote address by Lori M. Poloni-Staudinger (Northern Arizona University) and J. Cherie Strachan (Central Michigan University) titled \u201cDemocracy is More Important Than a P-Value: Embracing Political Science\u2019s Civic Mission through Intersectional Engaged Learning.\u201d During the plenary keynote session, APSA President Paula McClain (Duke University) offered remarks and presented two prestigious awards: the Michael Brintnall Award to John Twichell (University of Miami) and the 2020 CQ Press Award for Teaching Innovation to Jennie SweetCushman (Chatham University). The 2020 APSA Teaching & Learning Conference focused on sharing knowledge, innovations, and teaching techniques that strive to empower students. In addition, the working group \u201ctrack\u201d model of the conference allowed in-depth discussion and debate on pedagogical issues relevant to teaching political science. This year the track themes focused on civic engagement; simulations and games; general education and interdisciplinary teaching; the virtually and technologically enhanced classroom; teaching research, writing, and information literacy; community engagement and experiential learning; inclusivity in classroom; and rethinking the undergraduate political science major. The 2020 TLC featured a new exciting professional development series as well, including workshops on \u201cArticulating Your Teaching Philosophy\u201d and \u201cUsing the Classroom as a Springboard for Broader Voter Student Engagement.\u201d APSA staff and TLC organizers thank those who participated and those who support APSA\u2019s efforts to highlight excellence in the scholarship of teaching and learning. The TLC has been a central part of APSA programs supporting the practice and scholarship of teaching and learning since 2005. Over the years, TLC has had considerable impact on teaching political science by providing an avenue to facilitate discussions among political scientists. Many political scientists have implemented some of the innovative techniques and simulations they learned at the TLCs. This year\u2019s fruitful meeting continued this tradition. The proceedings of the meeting will be shared discipline-wide through the track summaries featured in the July issue of PS: Political Science & Politics. \u25a0",

    "title": "Engineering Student Attitudes to E-Reading in Remote Teaching Environments",
    "abstract": "Rational: Academic libraries are increasingly offering online e-books because they provide convenient access for students, cost savings, logistical advantages and significant portability. Current research suggests that this trend will continue in the future. In parallel with the growth of the e-book market and the development of e-book library collections, librarians and information scientists have conducted a number of research studies to investigate the impact of e-books on collection development: specifically, relating to the challenges and questions of e-book management and service. Consequently, researchers have considered it pertinent to explore the behaviours and strategies of e-book readers.Scope: In January 2020, institutions around the globe faced significant disruption due to COVID-19. Many universities accelerated their adoption of online/e-learning approaches in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Though e-books were at an early stage of adoption and the culture of using them in academia was slowly growing, they suddenly became the preferred option, if not the sole option because libraries were closed. Accordingly, some of the popular publishers; for example, Cambridge University Press, have offered online higher education textbooks as free-to-access. Over 700 textbooks were available for more than 2 months, regardless of whether those textbooks had previously been purchased. Furthermore, MIT Press offered complimentary access to its catalogue of e-books to support faculty and students who were working and learning remotely.Methodology: Despite increasing interest from librarians and learning technologists, prior to 2020, there were few well conducted studies investigating the habits of e-book users, especially amongst engineering students. Notwithstanding the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, an opportunity has arisen to survey student attitudes regarding the adoption of e-reading in an academic context. In this paper, a case study is presented that investigates the impact of the mandatory use of an e-book textbook in a final year undergraduate engineering module at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. The paper investigates Science and Engineering students\u2019 usage and attitudes towards e-books when using their available e-readers, which include PCs or portable devices. A cross-sectional survey containing 5 nominal questions, 2 open questions and 17 Likert questions was developed and deployed to final year students from two programmes: Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering. These students were attending the module titled Integrated Circuits and Systems.Findings: The results of this study highlight approaches for improving support for e-reading in an academic environment Of particular interest to librarians are student attitudes after their adjustment to e-books, which have implications for future purchasing decisions. Furthermore, student strategies for adjusting their learning techniques as a result of forced engagement with e-books illustrate preferences that can inform educators.In conclusion, the forced adoption of e-books has presented the opportunity to investigate student acceptance and strategies. This research provides evidence for purchasing decisions and strategies for adopting e-books in wider Higher Education syllabi.",

    "abstract": "Studies by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Merrill Lynch predicted that the space industry will be worth $1.1-2.7 trillion by the end of 2040. The rapidly growing space industry has stimulated a demand for experiences in learning design, simulation, and testing techniques to develop the more efficient liquid rocket engines. This has triggered the current trend in the research and development of rocket engines with increasing numbers of universities participating in student rocketry challenges across the USA. There are many university clubs (e.g., Cornell Rocketry Team, MIT Rocket Team, Portland State Aerospace Space Society, SEDS at US San Diego, etc.) in the nation, but there was no rocketry program at any HBCU among more than 100 HBCUs in the country until last year that Morgan State University (MSU) was awarded an HBCU space challenge grant by BASE 11 to develop the first rocketry program at an HBCU. The rocketry program at MSU just officially started in January 2020 and this study is one of the projects related to the rocketry program. The objectives of this study are to: (1) involve the concepts of the multidisciplinary engineering education that prepares students to work effectively with others from outside of their major disciplines and (2) develop the first liquid rocket by minority students among the HBCUs. The study involved studying the team structures among existing rocket teams at several universities in order to learn from their wealth of experience; understanding key skills and tools for designing and manufacturing of liquid rocket engines; and identifying the necessary courses for developing aerospace and rocketry program module which cuts across the science and engineering majors. Results and findings from this study will engage more multidisciplinary minority students in the Aerospace Program at Morgan State University.",

    "title": "Effect Analysis of Behavioral Change Strategy Applied to Nutritional Intervention in Patients with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma",
    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of nutritional nurse-led multidisciplinary team on nutritional intervention for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDCA). Methods Using the behavioral change strategy as a framework, 50 patients were subjected to individualized dietary behavior intervention for 12 weeks. Results The multidisciplinary team led by nutrition nurses used behavior change strategies to significantly improve the nutritional status of pancreatic patients. The behavior change strategies combined clinical evidence provided evidence for evidence-based interventions. Conclusion Behavior change strategies which provide a theoretical framework for nursing interventions. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most malignant tumors. Official US data show that PDCA is expected to be the second leading cause of death by 2030 [2] . In China, the incidence of pancreatic cancer increased from 1.3% per year from 2000 to 2011 . As everyone knows, the main challenge facing people with cancer is the impact of the disease on nutritional status and ultimately the quality of life. The main feature of PDCA-induced malnutrition is weight loss, and it is multifaceted, including pancreatic insufficiency caused by cancer (including exocrine: steatosis; endocrine: diabetes) [5]. Weight loss is often the main cause of concern for patients, driving them to seek medical help again. Research reports indicate that the weight loss rate of PDCA patients is as high as 70% to 75%, and almost three-quarters of the subjects lose more than 5% of their weight [6] [7]. The MST malnutrition screening tool is a simple, fast, effective, and reliable tool developed by Ferguson [8] to identify patients at risk of malnutrition. It is recommended by the American Dietetic Association and can be used for adults Screening of nutritional risks for inpatients. There are two main problems, namely, changes in body weight and changes in dietary intake. The behavior change strategy [1] is a comprehensive, consensus intervention strategy for behavior change developed by the University of London's Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology Research, which is a complex and interactive strategy [9]. Before the behavior change intervention, we must fully collect all the mechanisms that affect behavior change. The mechanisms are accumulated into useful information, including replication, evidence synthesis, implementation, and formation of activity plans. Interventions must be clear to ensure their effectiveness [10] [11]. 1 Method and Objects 2020 International Conference on Social and Human Sciences (ICSHS2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000175 ISBN: 978-1-80052-000-4 963 -",

    "abstract": "The International scientific conference on \u201cCivil Engineering Design and Construction\u201d (DCB) is held every two years, starting in 2000 as a national conference of the Union of Bulgarian Construction Engineers and the Bulgarian Scientific and Technical Union of Civil Engineering. This conference is of special importance for Bulgaria, where scientists, researchers and experts present their achievements and share their experience or innovative ideas in various fields of design, construction and architecture. Since 2006, the DCB conference has been held as an international scientific forum for in-depth discussions and fruitful meetings. The organiser of the XI Conference on \u201cCivil Engineering Design and Construction\u201d (DCB\u20322020) was the Scientific and Technical Union of Civil Engineering in Bulgaria (NTSSB), strongly supported by the Chamber of Engineers in the Investment Design in Bulgaria, Bulgarian Construction Chamber, Federation of the Bulgarian Scientific and Technical Unions, the Varna Free University and \u201cEvrika\u201d Foundation. Special attention was paid to sustainable construction, digitalisation in the construction industry and building information modelling (BIM). During the conference, we celebrated the 220th anniversary of the birth of the Usta (Master) Kolyu Ficheto \u2013 famous Bulgarian National Revival architect and builder. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, this year\u2019s conference, which was supposed to be held in Varna Free University \u201cChernorizets Hrabar\u201d, Bulgaria, was organised as a virtual conference, using of Google G-suit platform. It was a fully synchronised online conference, that had live Q&A, participants jointly listened to presentations, and attended other live events associated with the conference. The dates of the virtual conference remained unchanged to the initially proposed dates, which were on September 10-12, 2020. The conference program was organised in 9 sessions, in which 4 plenary and 68 specialized reports were presented.

    "title": "Challenges to Medical Education on Surgical Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "abstract": "The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic to the USA in March of 2020 had a profound and unforeseen effect on education of Americanmedical students. Students and faculty in the middle of academic programs were given little advance notice that learning would be disrupted. As the epidemic spread, concerns grew for medical systems becoming overwhelmed with new cases and needing to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Medical schools moved to cancel classes and restrict students from participating in clinical activities or even setting foot in their affiliated medical centers. With recommendations for social distancing and state-ordered mandates to stay at home, students were additionally forbidden from getting together in groups and had to remain physically separated from anyone other than immediate family. Previous disruptions in medical education have been described in the literature, generally in the forms of natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes [1\u20133]. Unlike these events, several factors made the COVID-19 pandemic unprecedented. The disruption was on a global scale\u2014not just affecting one medical school or one community, but institutions across the country and around the world. Solutions that helped to circumvent the effects of financial failures and natural disasters, such as the distribution of students to other institutions or programs would not apply in this case [1\u20134]. The length of the disruption is likely to be greater than that for other examples as well. Floods recede and earthquakes cease, with recovery linked to the time it takes to rebuild and redevelop infrastructure. In the case of the current pandemic, effects on student participation will likely last until the threat of infection abates, which may not occur until a reliable and effective vaccination program is in place, an intervention predicted to require a year or more. For other disasters, there was little or no risk to students beyond the initial insult; students suffered from emotional and financial trauma following natural disasters but did not remain at risk of physical harm. In those cases, students were often enlisted to help with recovery efforts and participate in clinical care, giving them a sense of purpose and a useful hands-on education. In the pandemic scenario, students are isolated and restricted from participation due to health concerns and the need to preserve resources for more extensively trained providers. Nevertheless, some lessons learned from responses to natural disasters have been applicable to the pandemic situation. Following Hurricane Katrina, the interruption in medical education necessitated some acceleration of the educational process, with a reevaluation of what requirements were necessary to graduate with an MD degree [5]. The pandemic situation is forcing educators to take a hard look at what the minimum requirements should be to complete a field of medical study. Medical educators and administrators are asked to make a difficult ethical decision, where the education and safety of trainees are being weighed against the increasing demands of medical personnel needed in high-risk environments. These situations also demonstrate the potential psychological trauma on students and emphasize the need for adequate student counseling and mental health resources [6]. Regarding educational content, all of these situations have prompted educators to look for alternative means of instruction outside of the classroom. Introduction of remote learning with televised lectures, online learning modules, and interactive online discussions have become important solutions to the lack of available time spent within institutional walls. Televised and electronic learning is most appropriate when replacing didactic content, whether related to basic sciences or clinical teaching. However, for rotations that involve large * Jonathan Schaffir jonathan.schaffir@osumc.edu",

    "title": "Personal views on the life, times and achievements of Professor Ronald Marks: a pioneering dermatologist, bioinstrumentalist and corneobiologist",
    "abstract": "This commentary is dedicated to Professor Ronald Marks who died on February 23, 2020 aged 84. In the days that followed, the sadness felt by many of those who were close to Ronnie was offset by the amazing number of tributes and fond memories of the man, his work and his influence on dermatology generally and the stratum corneum barrier specifically. It is his contribution to our understanding of the stratum corneum and the skin barrier, hence cosmetic science, which makes it important to reflect on Ronnie\u2019s life in this journal. He was born in 1935 and educated in London and awarded a scholarship to train in medicine at Guy\u2019s Hospital Medical School. On qualifying, after obligatory \u2018house officer\u2019 jobs, his interest in dermatology began during his 5 years\u2019 National Service. Growing his interest and experience in teaching and research St George\u2019s Hospital and St Johns Institute of Dermatology, he obtained a Fulbright scholarship to work with Professor Harvey Blank in Miami USA, making and retaining many contacts there, as well as a love for Miami! His influence and reputation was consolidated in Cardiff where, in his dual role as clinician and university lecturer, he established a laboratory group with its own histological service and skin research facilities. Growing to more than 20 staff at its peak, including several PhD students, Ronnie extended the group\u2019s facilities to include non-invasive assessments, tissue quantification, immunolocalization, protein and lipid analyses, tissue culture and genetics. In order to extend the research possibilities, he developed relationships with other departments \u2013 medical physics and medical illustration in particular. The same was true of his relationships outside academia, exploring mutual interests and collaborations with the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries, allowing Ronnie to augment his Science Research council funding. In parallel to this, Ronnie also extended his teaching and training interests, establishing, with fellow Cardiff dermatologist, Dr Andrew Finlay, an MSc course in dermatological sciences. He and Andrew also established The Journal of Dermatological Treatment in 1989, still an important title for communicating dermatological practice. His dual clinical/academic activities were also reflected by his membership of, and service with, groups such as the British Association of Dermatologists, European Academy for Dermatology and Venerology, British and European Societies for Dermatological Research, and the American Academy of Dermatology, to name but a few. Members of Ronnie\u2019s research group regularly made contributions to publications and conferences and, as if that was not enough, he became a driving force in creating other scientific interest groups \u2013 International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) and International Society for Stratum Corneum Research (ISSCR). Amongst his many affiliations, he served as President of the European Society for Dermatological Research and was awarded honorary membership in 2013; a year later, he was awarded the Sir Archibald Gray Medal. This is awarded as the British Association of Dermatologists\u2019 ultimate accolade for outstanding services to dermatology. Ronnie\u2019s contributions to cosmetic science were recognized when he presented the SCS Medal Lecture in 1993. The other sides of Ronnie, which many would not have seen, included a passion for the arts, music and theatre \u2013 he once directed a play for an amateur drama group in Cardiff. With his wife Hilary, these artistic interests continued to fill his \u2018retirement\u2019 years \u2013 though he never really retired. Though his health and mobility deteriorated, Ronnie retained his incisive wit and occasional irascibility, though this was probably borne out of frustration at his reduced physical capabilities. Between 1973 and 1985, Ronnie was Assistant Editor of the British Journal of Dermatology. It was therefore a fitting tribute for this journal to publish a supplement dedicated to Ronnie\u2019s work on Stratum Corneum, with contributions from several academics and previous co-workers whom he had inspired. Alex Anstey, the then Editor of the BJD and former trainee under Ronnie, wrote a preface to this publication remembering \u2018Saturday morning histopathology sessions\u2019 being much more than a diagnostic activity:",

    "title": "Editorial: Climate, Land Use, and Fire: Can Models Inform Management?",
    "abstract": "Changes in fire regimes, including changes in fire intensity, frequency, and seasonality have resulted from anthropogenic activities including shifts in land use, land management practices, urbanization of the wildlands, and human-caused climate change (e.g., Bowman et al., 2020; Coop et al., 2020). The clear human fingerprint on fire activity in many regions (Archibald et al., 2013) indicates that landscape management may alter the trajectory of fire regimes in a changing climate. This hopeful call to action requires a sound understanding of landscape management effects on across different fire regimes in the context of other human and biophysical factors. It is challenging to isolate the individual contributions of these factors given their diverse spatial and temporal footprints. However, a diversity of modeling efforts can be used to improve understanding of changing fire regimes, to assess vulnerability to societal and ecosystem values, and to help design and test effective management options that would mitigate undesirable outcomes (e.g., fire impacts to communities, degradation of air quality, change in ecosystem structure, feedbacks to global climate) while preserving many of the ecological benefits of fire. Recent trends in extreme fire seasons including the 2019\u20132020 Southeast Australian bushfires (Nolan et al., 2020) and the 2020 Western United States fires (Higuera and Abatzoglou, 2020) catalyze the need to deliver useful science-based information to decision-makers for devising effective adaptive strategies to reduce the impacts from future extreme fire seasons. Humans have long influenced fire regimes, albeit in complex and heterogeneous ways (e.g., Pyne 1993). Land use changes have continued in recent decades as agricultural expansion and intensification have reduced burned area in grasslands and savannas (e.g., Andela et al., 2017), while land exploitation and deforestation have increased fire occurrence in peatlands (e.g., Normile 2019) and forests (e.g., Escobar 2019). While fire is a biophysical process, human behavior and decisions drive many global fire regimes and changes thereof. Humans dictate many fire regimes though a number of vehicles: adding ignitions in places and at times of year that ecosystems have not been subject to in the past (e.g., Syphard and Keeley 2014; Balch et al., 2017); introducing invasive species that cause surface fuel continuity where patchiness prevented fire spread (e.g., Brooks et al., 2004); suppressing fire thereby allowing for fuel accumulation and expansion of fire sensitive species (e.g., Novacki and Abrams 2008); establishing fire-prone homogeneous tree plantations (e.g., Zald and Dunn 2018); and expanding the wildland urban interface (e.g., Mietkiewicz et al., 2020).

    "title": "Insufficient Fibrinolysis in COVID-19: A Systematic Review of Thrombolysis Based on Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression",
    "abstract": "Background: How aberrant\u00a0fibrinolysis influences the clinical progression of COVID-19 presents a clinicopathological dilemma challenging intensivists. To investigate whether abnormal fibrinolysis is a culprit or protector or both, we associated elevated plasma D-dimer with clinical variables to identify a panoramic view of the derangements of fibrinolysis that contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 based on studies available in the literature. \n \nMethods:\u00a0We performed this systematic review based on both meta-analysis and meta-regression to compute the correlation of D-dimer at admission with clinical features of COVID-19 patients in retrospective studies or case series. We searched the databases until Aug 18, 2020, with no limitations by language. The first hits were screened, data extracted, and analyzed in duplicate. We did the random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions (both univariate and multivariate). D-dimer associated clinical variables and potential mechanisms were schematically reasoned and graphed. \n \nFindings:\u00a0Our search identified 42 observational, or retrospective, or case series from six countries (n=14,862\u00a0patients) with all races and ages from\u00a01\u00a0to 98-year-old. The weighted mean difference of D-dimer was 0.97\u00a0ug/mL (95% CI 0.65, 1.29) between relatively mild (or healthy control) and severely affected groups with significant publication bias. Univariate meta-regression identified 58 of 106 clinical variables were associated with plasma D-dimer levels, including 3 demographics, 5 comorbidities, 22 laboratory tests, 18 organ injury biomarkers, 8 severe complications, and 2 outcomes (discharge and death). Of these, 11 readouts were negatively associated with the level of plasma D-dimer. Further, age and gender were confounding factors for the identified D-dimer associated variables. There were 22 variables independently correlated with the D-dimer level, including respiratory rate, dyspnea plasma K+, glucose, SpO2, BUN, bilirubin, ALT, AST, systolic blood pressure, and CK. We thus propose that insufficient hyperfibrinolysis (fibrinolysis is accelerated but unable to prevent adverse clinical impact for clinical deterioration COVID-19) as a peculiar mechanism. \n \nInterpretation:\u00a0The findings of this meta-analysis- and meta-regression-based systematic review supports elevated D-dimer as an independent predictor for mortality and severe complications. D-dimer-associated clinical variables draw a landscape integrating the aggregate effects of systemically suppressive and locally (i.e., in the lung) hyperactive derangements of fibrinolysis. D-dimer and associated clinical biomarkers and conceptually parameters could be combined for risk stratification, potentially for tracking thrombolytic therapy or alternative interventions. \n \nFunding: NIH grants: HL87017 (HLJ), HL095435 (MAM), HL134828 (MAM), HL130402 (AK&SI), AI112381(SLL), AI150473 (SLL), HL154103 (SI &AK), and HL14285301 (SI) \n \nDeclaration of Interests: None of the authors have any conflict of interest to declare.

    "title": "Core Technology Principle, Key Types and Application Research on the Reproduction of Mudslide Animation",
    "abstract": "Mudslide animation can present the dynamic process of mudslide disaster to people through virtual way, this paper classifies the composition type of mudslide from the cause of mudslide disaster, and then makes the mudslide animation more efficient and concrete when it reproduces in virtual, discusses the disaster warning, real-time reproduction of disaster for mudslide animation, Reflect the loss situation and the positive significance of knowledge dissemination. 1. The Significance of The Study of Mudslide Animation Mudslide flow is a sudden natural disaster phenomenon, mostly in the valley deep in the mountains or hillside areas, has a strong destructive, each year in China's mountains caused huge casualties and property losses, its characteristics include the strong, fast, destructive, huge flow, the occurrence of short time and high frequency. The reasons for its composition are produced under the combined effect of geological structure, topography, human economy and meteorology, and usually contain huge solid rock blocks and high-concentration sediment mixtures, showing the flow of the viscous layer flow and the sparse layer flow mixture. The motion form of mudslide includes a mixture of landslides and water-based sediments, which is a state of special material fluid movement of complex mixtures. The characteristics of the high intensity of mudslide eruption struck from the accumulation of the amount during the formation process to reach a zero boundary point, and after the occurrence of periodic, mass hair and the same hairstyle and other characteristics, so in the short term, a large number of rock blocks, sediments and trees from the ground height from top to bottom, and the formation of a stacking area, Where it goes, it causes great damage to the human production environment, poses a great threat to the safety of human life and property, and causes great damage to the construction of human infrastructure. And in the rapid development of modern computer film and television animation technology today, we can through the mud flow disaster computer simulation animation reproduction to study it, let it in the form of animation simulation rendering, so that we can more intuitive and specific analysis of it, which is in society, campus, In particular, it is of great significance to carry out popular science education in mountainous areas prone to mudslide disasters. 2. Key Types of Causes of Mudslide Disasters Collapses and landslides are usually caused by the loss of stability of geological slope rock and soil, and the causes are often inextricably linked, which can be considered as a large category in the key types of mudslide animation. Based on the leading factors to subdivide it, it can be divided into blasting vibration-induced, permeable irrigation-induced type, reservoir immersion-induced type, engineering load-trigger type, cut slope discharge type, underground excavation-induced type, freeze-thaw osmosis-induced type, natural evolution-induced type, earthquake-induced type, rain-induced type. The composition of the mudslide is a complex special fluid formed by the mixture of loose rock and soil and liquid water and other debris, which is considered as another type in the key type of 2020 International Conference on Social and Human Sciences (ICSHS2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000187 ISBN: 978-1-80052-000-4 1027 mudslide animation, and the mudslide disaster can be initially divided into the type of landslide erosion, the ice lake dam collapse type, the tailings dam collapse type, the project abandoned collapse type, the landslide dam collapse type, the landslide dam collapse type, Slope liquefaction type, valley evolution type. Accumulation slide erosion type: natural or man-made landslides or loose geology due to sharp rainfall, slope surface due to infiltration of rain caused by liquefaction, the formation of plastic flow of slip or landslide, and then along the depression caused by landslides repeatedly washed erosion, resulting in the formation of ditch shaping and trench erosion type of mudslides. Ice Lake Dam Collapse Type: A special type of mudslide formed in the high-cold mountain area, the advance of the glacier, the ice tongue fracture, the collapse or landslide on the slope of the ice lake, the melting acceleration caused by the rise in temperature, the collapse caused by the lake mouth to the lower part of the ice dam caused the ice lake to collapse, resulting in millions or even hundreds of millions of cubic meters of water immediately tilted down, During the period will be wrapped in a large number of sediment and rocks, the formation of ferocious, huge flow, short time, strong destructive landslide disaster. Tailing dam collapse type: because the mixture of tailings, slag and water body gradually over time makes the tailings dam deformation penetration, collapse formation, tailings reservoir due to artificial supervision and maintenance loopholes, may breed mudslide disaster, but also pollution of land and water resources. Engineering abandoned collapse type: in the process of construction due to surface excavation or underground excavation of slag in the ditch unreasonable emission accumulation, hindering the surface runoff or flash flood channel, accompanied by heavy rainfall under the formation of temporary lake, the rapid rise of water level and permeation deformation of geological rock and soil rapid liquefaction, subsidence and break the embankment to form a mudslide. Landslide dam collapse type: a landslide caused by rainfall, earthquake or engineering activities, due to the gradual rise of water level, loose rock and soil penetration deformation or new factors lead to landslides or the formation of a dammed lake breakwater the embankment of the mudslide. Slope liquefaction type: Slope rock and soil caused by regional typhoon rain or continuous local heavy rain in mountainous and hilly areas due to rain erosion, rapid saturation of rock and soil, and suddenly flow downward. The evolution of the valley type: In the evolution of the geological environment of the natural valley, the phenomenon of the effect of saturation, erosion, transportation and accumulation of rock and soil accumulation, the mudslide slower of the valley can be divided into three parts, namely, the source area, the circulation area and the accumulation area. Its basic characteristics are large water area, long movement path and strong destructive ability, often accompanied by landslides, showing a certain periodicity. 3. The Core Principle of Mudslide Animation 3.1 Key Parameters of Mudslide Special Effects Technology The main object of mudslide is the mixture fluid, which contains a variety of elements, such as liquid, solid and hybrid, in the process of mudslide, the accompanying fluid phenomenon is pour, collapse, break the embankment, collision, parcel, etc., has the basic characteristics of variability and mobility. In the physical parameters of the fluid and the parameters of the model algorithm, the parameters of fluid physics mainly include the number of particles of the fluid, particle mass, particle radius, static density, gravity acceleration and viscosity coefficient of the fluid, the radius of the particles determines the degree of fluid thinning, the static density determines the fluid mass, gravity acceleration determines the motion speed of the fluid. The above is the basic unit of computer computing behind the software simulation in the simulation mudslide animation. The representative software for simulating mudslides, such as RealFlow, 3dsMax, Rayfire, etc., can virtually different types of fluids and different elements of fluid strapped to the fluid, which can",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT COVID-19 has turned the tables on every part of our lives, as hardly any sector is left without a profound impact, including the higher education sector. During this pandemic, the higher education sector has been obliged to deliver education virtually. This article has two purposes: firstly, to highlight how students grade their virtual learning experience during COVID-19, and secondly, to what extent they would like to (partially) continue learning virtually, even after social distancing. In this study, a quantitative method is applied, using the non-probability volunteer sampling method. Responses from 265 people were collected from different Dutch academic universities as well as universities of applied sciences. This study illustrates that a larger number (70%) of the students grade the virtual learning experience as sufficient and better, and that the majority would like to partially follow virtual lessons even after social distancing. Hence, it is recommended for educational institutions to seriously start preparing an online learning programme for the upcoming study year (2020/2021) and consider virtual learning to be a steady part of their future curriculum.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although novel treatment regimens for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)\u00a0continiue to be developed, however, the relative efficacy of and safety is unclear because there have been few head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We aimed to\u00a0compare and rank the efficacy and safety of first- and second-line treatments for patients with advanced HCC. \n \nMethods: In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov) were systematically searched\u00a0for\u00a0phase III randomised controlled trials comparing any two or three treatment methods in the first- and second-line setting for advanced HCC\u00a0from the inception of each database to July 2020. Eligible studies had to report at least one of the following clinical outcome measures: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events (AEs). \n \nFindings: We analysed 22 trials (eleven in the first-line setting and 11 in the second-line setting) involving 7250 patients.\u00a0For first-line regimens, atezolizumab+bevacizumab was most likely to be ranked first for cumulative 1-year OS (cumulative probability 53%), lenvatinib for both 6-month PFS (50%) and DCR (40%), followed by atezolizumab+bevacizumab (32% and 28% for PFS and DCR, respectively). With respect to safety, linifanib had the highest probability of grade \u22653 AEs (51%) and sorafenib+erlotinib had the most favourable safety profile for reducing them\u00a0(40%). For second-line regimens, regorafenib had the highest probability of achieving the best cumulative 1-year OS (surface under the cumulative ranking curve [SUCRA], 0\u00b7945) followed by cabozantinib (0\u00b7814). Cabozantinib had the best clinical efficacy for prolonging 6-month PFS (0\u00b7922) and enhancing DCR (0\u00b7954) followed by regorafenib (0\u00b7821 and 0\u00b7894, respectively). For grade \u22653 AEs, cabozantinib had the highest probability (SUCRA, 0\u00b7953) followed by regorafenib (SUCRA, 0\u00b7854), everolimus (SUCRA, 0\u00b7663), and pembrolizumab (SUCRA, 0\u00b7314) successively. \n \nInterpretation: This network meta-analysis shows that combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab had the best performance regarding improving OS with acceptable toxicity in patients with advanced HCC not previously treated with systemic therapy. Regorafenib was the best treatment regimen in enhancing OS in patients with disease progression during first-line treatment with sorafenib.\u00a0 \n \nFunding: \u00a0National Nature Science Foundation of China \n \nDeclaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests. \n \nEthics Approval Statement: All analyses were conducted on the basic of previous published studies; therefore, no ethical approval and patients\u2019 consent were required.",

    "abstract": "This case, which has been taught successfully in a Darden online class, allows for an introductory application of the Tableau analytics platform. In 2012, Carvana Co., an e-commerce platform for buying used cars, hosted a competition called \"Don't Get Kicked!\" wherein 570 teams competed to predict if a car purchased at auction was a \"kick\" (i.e., a bad buy)\u2014a vehicle with a major defect. To compete, teams downloaded Carvana's data from Kaggle's website. At the time of the competition, data science was a burgeoning field, and industry watchers wondered if machine learning could help a company such as Carvana develop a competitive advantage.

Vehicles could then be delivered or picked up at one of about a dozen car vending machines in a handful of mostly southern US states.

With significant growth in sales since its service launched in 2013, there was a strong argument for the \"Amazon of cars\" to go public. \"We clearly got to a place in the business where we got to execution mode and we needed to open more markets and ramp up sales in markets we were already in,\" Ernie Garcia III, Carvana's 34-year-old cofounder and CEO said. \"It became a much clearer story to tell the public markets.

    "abstract": "Background: Currently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, causing an unprecedented pandemic. However, there is still no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the Chinese guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, we conducted a clinical trial with the objective of comparing the effectiveness of three antiviral treatment regimens in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. \n \nMethods: This was a single-center, randomized, open-labeled, prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 were randomized into three groups: ribavirin (RBV) plus interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), lopinavir /ritonavir (LPV/r) plus IFN-\u03b1, and ribavirin plus LPV/r plus IFN-\u03b1 at a 1:1:1 ratio. Each patient was invited to participate in a 28-day follow-up after initiation of an antiviral regimen. The primary outcome was the difference in median interval to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity among the three groups. The secondary outcomes were the differences in the rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity at day 14 after antiviral treatment initiation, the mortality rate for COVID-19 patients at day 28 after antiviral treatment initiation, the rate of patients re-classified as severe cases during the study period, the rate of adverse events during the study period, and the rate of antiviral drug discontinuations due to adverse events during the study period. \n \nFindings: In total, we enrolled 101 patients in this study. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients were comparable among the three groups. In the analysis of intention-to-treat data, the median interval from baseline to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity was 12 days in the LPV/r+IFN-\u03b1-treated group, as compared with 13 days and 15 days in the RBV+IFN-\u03b1-treated group and in the RBV+LPV/r+ IFN-\u03b1-treated group, respectively ( p =0\u00b723). The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity rate in the LPV/r+IFN-\u03b1-treated group (61\u00b71%) was higher than the RBV+ IFN-\u03b1-treated group (51\u00b75%) and the RBV+LPV/r+IFN-\u03b1-treated group (46\u00b79%) at day 14; however, the difference in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity rate between these groups was calculated to be statistically insignificant. The RBV+LPV/r+IFN-\u03b1-treated group developed a significantly higher rate of gastrointestinal adverse events than the LPV/r+ IFN-\u03b1-treated group and the RBV+ IFN-\u03b1-treated group. \n \nInterpretation: Our results indicate that there is no significant differences among the three regimens in terms of antiviral effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, which therefore implies that the antiviral effectiveness of LPV/r+IFN-\u03b1, RBV+IFN-\u03b1, and RBV+LPV/r+IFN-\u03b1 for SARS-CoV-2 in the management of COVID-19 is questionable, although the possibility of these three regimens having similar antiviral efficacy could not be definitively excluded. Furthermore, the combination of RBV and LPV/r is associated with a significant increase in gastrointestinal adverse events, suggesting that RBV and LPV/r should not be co-administered to COVID-19 patients simultaneously. \n \nTrial Registration: Registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029387). \n \nFunding Statement: National Science and Technology Major Project of China During the 13th Five-year Plan Period (2018ZX10302104001); and the Chongqing Special Research Project for Prevention and Control of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (No. cstc2020jscx-fyzx0074); and the Novel Coronavirus Infection and Prevention Emergency Research Project of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (KYYJ202001). \n \nDeclaration of Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as potential conflicts of interest. \n \nEthics Approval Statement: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (2020-002-01-KY).",

K. J. Leonard & Suggs] in one of the populations, although two of the five BLS regions were involved in resistance to other diseases. These data will be useful for developing maize varieties resistant to BLS to mitigate the impact of bacterial leaf streak on maize production. Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) of maize (Zea mays L.), caused by Xanthomonas vasicola pv. vasculorum (Cobb) comb. nov. (Xvv), recently emerged in the Americas, and little is known about host resistance to the disease (Damicone et al., 2018; Jamann et al., 2019; Korus et al., 2017; Leite et al., 2019; Plazas et al., 2018). Bacterial leaf streak was first reported in South Africa in 1949 (Dyer, 1949) and was limited to the African continent until recently. In 2010, researchers detected BLS symptoms in northern Argentina, and since that time, the disease has expanded from C\u00f3rdoba Province to other provinces in Argentina (Plazas et al., 2018). It was suspected that BLS was present in Brazil for some time, and the disease was recently positively confirmed (Leite et al., 2019). In the United States, BLS was first reported in Nebraska in 2014 and subsequently was confirmed in Colorado and Kansas (Korus et al., 2017). After the initial reports of BLS in the United States, surveys were conducted in Oklahoma and Illinois, and the disease was found in both states (Damicone et al., 2018; Jamann et al., 2019). Currently, the pathogen range includes Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas (Damicone et al., 2018; Jamann et al., 2019; Lang et al., 2017). The sudden spread of BLS in North and South America is likely the result of a more virulent novel strain of Xvv (Perez-Quintero et al., 2019). The population of Xvv that has emerged in North and South America appears to be the result of horizontal genomic acquisitions of multiple gene clusters by Xvv, which infects maize, from X. vasicola pv. holcicola (Xvh), which infects sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] (Perez-Quintero et al., 2019). It is unclear if the genomic acquisitions are specifically responsible for the increase in virulence and spread of the pathogen, but all 22 isolates of Xvv from North and South America sequenced to date carry these gene clusters from Xvh, whereas the isolates of Xvv from South Africa lack these regions from Xvh (Perez-Quintero et al., 2019). The isolates of Xvv from North and South America also cause larger lesions on corn than isolates of Xvv from South Africa (Perez-Quintero et al., 2019). Initial research on the disease ecology of BLS in North America reported irrigation use, multiple years of corn in a crop rotation, the corn plant being at the V7 to R2 growth stage (Abendroth et al., 2011), and planting after 2 May as the most important predictors for Xvv incidence (Hartman, 2018). Corn planted into a previous year\u2019s corn residue is at greater risk for the disease, as the pathogen is able to survive in infected corn residue from the previous season (Ortiz-Castro et al., 2018). The disease is often most severe and frequently observed in irrigated fields (Damicone et al., 2018; Hart",

    "title": "Humble Pi: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World",
    "abstract": "HUMBLE PI: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World by Matt Parker. New York: Riverhead Books, 2020. 336 pages. Hardcover; $27.00. ISBN: 9780593084687. *Humble Pi delivers a veritable potpourri of mathematical mistakes in the real world, as the title suggests. Consequently, the book may be of interest to a wide variety of readers. Mathematics educators who are looking for reasons why their students should pay attention in class will find plenty of examples to convince even the most skeptical student that mathematical mistakes can have real-world consequences. Meanwhile, readers who struggled in math class may be happy to see that even the supposed experts suffer the consequences of their own miscalculations. While the book is predominantly written in a light-hearted tone that makes it relatively easy to read for a broad audience, it occasionally is somber when real lives are put in danger due to the math going wrong. *The author, Matt Parker, is likely more well known as a YouTube mathematician. His channel \"Stand-up Maths\" has half a million subscribers and sixty million views. Parker's attempt to channel his high energy, \"math is fun\" persona into the written word is a challenging task, but he mostly delivers. For example, the page numbers count down until they reach 0, causing an error so the next page is numbered 4,294,967,295. This seemingly random large number happens to be 232 - 1; reading the rest of the book will explain why. The chapters count up from 0, except for a small chapter 9.49 which follows the chapter on rounding. Parker adds levity at the meta level as well as in the writing itself which builds on itself effectively. For this reason, readers who already are familiar with Parker's work on YouTube will likely catch some extra inside jokes. However, to be clear, the book is not simply fan fiction; it is a well-researched and thorough account of mathematical mistakes in various contexts and should appeal to a wide audience. *The content of the book is organized into chapters based on the types of mistakes: losing track of time, counting errors, geometry gone awry, unit conversions, and statistics, to name a few. If one chapter fails to capture interest, the next one delivers something fresh. While this feature is mostly true, it fails in one way. So many of the mistakes come down to computer programming errors. At the core, there is a mathematical idea at play, but the mistake comes from improperly coding that idea into a computer. The author did research a rich set of mathematical mistakes, but often it was not the mathematics that failed but the programming. As a mathematician, I was hoping for more mistakes that felt like mathematics itself going wrong. Yet I suspect that for most readers this is a distinction without a\u00a0difference. *While the author is not writing explicitly from a Christian perspective, that does not mean that the book is therefore neutral or without perspective. Parker finds a deep joy in the doing of mathematics, a latent aspect of creation awaiting cultivation; he may not express it this way, but the joy is unmistakable. Many of the errors depicted in the book have led to the loss, or near loss, of human lives, sometimes in the hundreds. In a way, this book deeply values life, and one possible outcome would be that people could be more aware of mitigating such errors. In the final chapter, titled \"So, What Have We Learned from Our Mistakes?,\" Parker writes: *\"I've done a lot of research from accident-investigation reports that were publicly released, but that generally happens only when there is a very obvious disaster. Many more, quiet mathematical mistakes are probably swept under the rug. Because we all make mistakes. Relentlessly. And that is nothing to be feared. Many people I speak to say that, when they were at school, they were put off mathematics because they simply didn't get it. But half the challenge of learning math is accepting that you may not be naturally good at it, but if you put the effort in, you can learn it. As far as I'm aware, the only quote from me that has been made into a poster by teachers and put up in the classrooms is: 'Mathematicians aren't people who find math easy; they're people who enjoy how hard it is'\" (p. 7). *This is a book which outlines mathematical mistakes in the hope that it could prevent some future mistakes; this hope is laudable, and it provides some levity along the way, which is sorely needed in 2020. However, the example of the UK government refusing to change the picture of an incorrect soccer ball on their signs suggests that many mathematical mistakes are likely to be commonplace. *Finally, it should be noted that the book is not only about mistakes, it also provides lots of \"Wow, I didn't know that!\" moments. Did you know that a year of \"seasons\" and a year of the earth's orbit are not the same thing? The book is peppered with vignettes such as this that keep the reader wanting more. In the end, the book is entertaining, includes a lot of fresh examples of math in the real world that STEM educators might find helpful, and is written for a broad audience. The fact that mathematics goes wrong in the modern world mostly in connection with computers is important to note; that there are so many ways for it to go wrong is fascinating. *Reviewed by Thomas J.

    "title": "Atmospheric rivers in the Australia-Asian region",
    "abstract": "In recent years,more andmore attention has been focused on the atmospheric river (AR) diagnosis and its application in characterising atmospheric moisture transport between the tropics and the extratropics. Significant research (see, for example, references in Ye et al. 2020) has been conducted over North America due to a close association between ARs and extreme rainfall events over thewest coast.More studies are beginning to emerge over other parts of the globe such as, for example, along the South American coasts and parts of Europe. There are hundredsofARstudiesbeingpublishedeachyear frommeteorologicalandhydrometeorologicalcommunitiesworldwide.However, there are only very limited AR studies in our region even though we have a significant number of synoptic events, such as Northwest Cloud Bands (NWCBs), which share some common features as described by the AR concept. Therefore, it is very pleasing to see this collaboration between scientists in the AustralianBureauofMeteorologyandtheChinaMeteorological Administration focused on this series of AR diagnostic studies over the Australia-Asian (A-A) region. I commend the strong scientific leadership and significant efforts of Dr. Huqiang Zhang and his collaborators in conducting this important researchandfurtherdeveloping their studies intosixmanuscripts in this Research Front of the Journal of Southern Hemisphere Earth Systems Science. I believe they will attract more interest from our research community and lead to further investigations of this important topic. I agree with the authors that the term \u2018atmospheric river\u2019 may create the wrong impression that the research is about \u2018rivers\u2019 in the sky,when in fact it refers to anarrowbandof stronghorizontal water vapour transport concentrated in the lower troposphere.As the authors point out, the use of the word \u2018river\u2019 comes from the fact that the amount of atmospheric vapour flux associated with such a structure is about the samevolume as for river flows on the ground. In this Research Front, the researchers have comprehensively documented their analysis ofARs inour region.Theyhave conducted detailed observational case studies of AR characteristics operating in the A-A region and their differences to ARs reported for the North American middle and high latitudes (Ye et al. 2020). They have applied backward trajectory analysis to explore the atmospheric moisture source for such ARs and highlighted tropical moisture as the primary contributor to the corresponding rainfall generated in the extratropics. They have investigatedthepotential linksbetweenARsinEastAsiaandover theAustralian continent andused suchconnections to explain the seasonality of NWCBs and ARs in our region (Xu et al. 2020a). They have further proposed a mechanism associated with teleconnections in the subtropical highs of both hemispheres to explain these connections. They have also assessed the potential ofusingARsto linkmodelskill (bothNWPandseasonal forecast) inforecastingthesestrongmoisturetransportswiththeir forecasts ofextremerainfall inbothcountries (Chenetal.2020;Liangetal. 2020). The authors also developedAR databases over China and Australia for a 30-year period usingmanual detections (Wu et al. 2020). These datasets were used to document the seasonality, interannual variations of ARs in both regions and identify some significant trends over Chinawhich are consistent with observed changes in its extreme rainfall characteristics. Finally, they reported on a study, using a suite of CMIP5 models, assessing theskillofcurrentclimatemodels insimulatingARsderivedfrom reanalysis data, and thepotential changes inARsunder awarmed climate (Xu et al. 2020b). Furthermore, they reported on some changeswhich are different from those reported for other regions due to the response of the Western Pacific Subtropical High to global warming. The results fromthiscollaborativeproject provideconvincing evidence of the value of applying AR diagnostics to gain a better understanding of atmospheric moisture transports affecting our weather and climate. The studies also show the potential of using ARs to improvemodel rainfall forecasts.Manystudies, including my own research on the impacts of tropical oceans such as the meridional IndianOceanDipoleonourweatherandclimate,have already shown the influence of the tropics on the dynamics and moisture conditions in our middle and high latitudes. The application of AR diagnostics provides an additional tool in understanding these relationships. I acknowledge the amount of work needed to conduct these studies which was made possible through this collaborative project. As the authors acknowledge, there is still more work that could be done using this analysis technique.TheARdatabase ofWu et al. (2020) is a very valuable resource and there is scope for developing it further by, for example, introducing automatic detections of ARs and incorporating the diagnosis as part of the routine operational products in CSIRO PUBLISHING",

    "title": "The Way to Cultivate College Students' Awareness of Responsibility",
    "abstract": "At present, our country is in a critical period of building a harmonious society. The report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed that the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation should be realized. Historical responsibility and mission pursuit are the inescapable responsibilities and obligations of young college students. In order to better strengthen the responsibility consciousness of young people in contemporary colleges and universities, this article proposes to cultivate young students' consciousness of responsibility in four aspects: ideological and political education, harmonious family culture, and related incentive mechanisms. Suggestions for the path. 1. Significance of Cultivating the Consciousness of Responsibilities for Young Students in Colleges and Universities In 2020, the number of graduates from ordinary colleges and universities in the country will exceed 8.74 million, and there will be more than 30 million students, and this number will be maintained for some time. At the same time, college students are an important part of each family, an important group of high-education people who will soon join the nation's construction, represent advanced productive forces, and be the mainstay of promoting the country's economic and social development and construction. The sense of responsibility for youth in colleges and universities includes responsibility for self and others, family and society, nation and country, and human and world development. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the guidance of Xi Jinping's ideology of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, our party has continued to deepen the regularity of the education cause in practice, focusing on the fundamental question of who to train, how to train, and for whom. Recognize and put forward a series of new ideas, new ideas, and new viewpoints. Schools are required to educate and guide students to nurture and implement the core values of socialism, and to cultivate socialist builders and successors who have developed morally, intellectually, and physically. The contemporary youth is a generation that is happier than their predecessors, and this also means that the younger generation needs to shoulder greater responsibilities, to bravely shoulder the heavy tasks entrusted by the times, to be ambitious and down-to-earth, and strive to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. When the \"Chinese Dream\" unleashes dreams, the courage of young people to take on the precious spiritual wealth left by the May 4th Movement is the entrustment and requirement of the socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era for the younger generation. The courage to bear the spiritual wealth inherited from the May 4th Movement: One hundred years ago, the youth of the era came forward at a time of great national suffering and took on a heroic role in exploring the way to save the country and the people. For the first time, the May 4th Movement proclaimed the main force of Chinese youth, and promoted a huge turning point in the development of modern Chinese society. In 1919, Mao Zedong, a 26-year-old youth, chanted \"the world, our world; the country, our country; the society, our society; we do n\u2019t say, who said? We do n\u2019t do it, Who does it? \"The May Fourth Youth is well aware of its glorious mission. It is 2020 Conference on Social Science and Modern Science (SSMS2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000744 ISBN: 978-1-80052-004-2 -267used to shoulder its historical responsibilities, combine personal future with the destiny of the country, link individual development with national rejuvenation, and shoulder the heavy responsibility of the times. Leave us precious spiritual wealth. The May Fourth Movement warned us that only by establishing ideals and convictions that are concentric with the theme of the times and fully integrated into the tide of the times and fulfilling the national and national responsibilities, can we realize greater value and truly gain happiness in life. Being brave is an inevitable requirement for the development of human society: Youth is an important force in the development and progress of human society. General Secretary Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: \"If you want youth, you have a country, and when you have a strong country, you have a strong country. When the young generation has ideals, skills, and responsibilities, the country has a future and the nation has hope. It is determined and required by the social material life and the status of workers in social relations. According to Marx and Engels, workers are always realistic people under certain social relations and social conditions. Such social relations and social conditions are essentially a regulation, a responsibility, and a mission for people. It is also a responsibility to be fulfilled. The younger generation is the hope of the country, which has given the younger generation more responsibility and sense of responsibility for the prosperity of the country, the rejuvenation of the nation, and the happiness of the people. The younger generation must not only be responsible, but also be able to do it. Starting from historical materialism, Marxism believes that the way of existence of young people determines the development of the future society, and the ideological status and scientific knowledge of young people determine the development trend of human society in the future. In the new era, Chinese youth must become the vital force for national rejuvenation, and they must be the pioneers, pioneers, and devotees who are at the forefront of the times. The courage to take on the responsibility of the country for youth in the new era: Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered the journey of a new era, and the country has ushered in a great leap from standing up, becoming rich, and becoming stronger. We are closer to the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than at any time in history. , The harder it takes us to work hard. \" In the new era, socialism with Chinese characteristics is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges, and it is necessary for contemporary youth to not forget their original intentions, forge ahead, and dedicate wisdom and strength. Being courageous is the mission and trust entrusted to contemporary youth in the new era. Contemporary youths take the initiative and act actively, and contribute their wisdom and strength to the construction of a socialist modernized country. Being brave is the right choice for self-realization of contemporary youth: Responsibility is the most valuable quality of youth in the new era, and it requires firm ideals and convictions and long-term commitment. Only by establishing firm ideals and convictions can we not linger and waver in our actions. The younger generation must continue to strengthen the \"four self-confidences\" from the profound logic of the theoretical logic of scientific socialist development and the historical logic of modern Chinese social development, and to consciously strengthen from the historical achievements and historical changes of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. \"Four consciousnesses\", \"two maintenances\", unify personal growth coordinates with national development trajectory, turn the ego into a big one, and strive to become a new-age youth with ambition and firm conviction. 2. The Way to Cultivate College Students' Awareness of Responsibility Due to the influence of family environment, school education, social relations, etc., there is a lack of subjective consciousness, inadequate thinking and maintenance, and inadequate social activities among contemporary college youth. Only effective measures can be taken to make young students realize that the harmonious development of society has Self-improvement provides the motive force, and it is necessary to repay the society and contribute to the society in the future",

    "abstract": "A Charlottesville-based manufacturer of \"kooky\" active-wear clothing must decide whether to outsource some of its shirts to a manufacturer in Hong Kong. While providing lower costs, the supplier reduces Yo Wear's flexibility to respond to changes in demand volume. Students must determine the relevant costs of sourcing in Hong Kong and making to order in house. A newsvendor-type model is required to determine the optimal order size from Hong Kong. \n \nExcerpt \n \nUVA-OM-1313 \n \nRev. Feb. 5, 2020 \n \nYo Wear, Inc. \n \nStanding in the doorway, Richard Crisler looked out into his warehouse at the hundreds of bolts of fabric and boxes of finished goods while the hum of several sewing machines filled the room behind him. Over the past 17 years, Crisler's company, with its line of kooky US-made activewear products, had ridden the apparel industry's roller coaster. At one time, he had 34 sales representatives tirelessly selling Yo Wear products in vacation areas throughout the United States. As he stood there pondering his sourcing dilemma, he could not help but wonder whether he would ever be able to get back up to $ 890,000 in annual sales and profitability. \n \nYo Wear's History \n \nCrisler received his BA in political science from Duke University in 1988. He was introduced to the apparel industry when he worked as a sales representative for University Screen Printing. For an independent study in his junior year, he started manufacturing and selling Duke-logo boxer shorts around campus under the brand name Statonwear. The underwear became so trendy that he was able to negotiate a deal with the university bookstore to supply it with boxer shorts for both in-store and catalog sales. The items were a hit. \"They're popular because you can walk around school in your underwear, and people won't look at you in a funny way,\" said Crisler. Crisler decided to change the company's name to something more catchy and appropriate to the product line. Statonwear, after a brief stint as Yo Boxer, became Yo Wear, with its trademarked \"Max Boxxer\" line of clothing (Exhibit 1). \n \n. . .",

    "title": "Respiratory Failure Among Patients with COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province, China: A Multicentre Retrospective Cohort Study",
    "abstract": "Background: Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the incidence and risk factors for respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 in Jiangsu province, China. \n \nMethods: We did a multicentre retrospective cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 diagnosed at 24 hospitals in Jiangsu province, China between 10 January and 18 February 2020. The demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features at admission were collected. Clinical outcomes were collected at 8 time points over 14 days from hospital admission. The primary outcome was the occurrence of acute respiratory failure within 14 days from admission, defined as oxygen saturation < 93% and/or partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood < 60 mm Hg on room air and/or requirement of high-flow nasal cannula therapy, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. \n \nFindings: Of the 626 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection during the study period, 620 (99.0%) had accessible medical records and were included in the study. Respiratory failure (mainly type I) occurred in 53 of 620 (8.6%) patients. As of 18 February 2020, no patients had died and 252 (40.6%) patients had been discharged. Some differences were observed in demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and radiological findings between patients with and without respiratory failure. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (year) (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.11; p < 0.0001), respiratory rate (OR, 1.19; 95% CI: 1.05-1.35; p = 0.0052), lymphocyte count (10 -9 /L) (OR, 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06-0.64, p = 0.0089), and pulmonary opacity (per 5%) (OR, 1.29, 95% CI: 1.09-1.52; p = 0.0052) at admission were associated with the occurrence of respiratory failure. \n \nInterpretation: The rate of respiratory failure and death was lower in patients with COVID-19 in Jiangsu than in Wuhan city and lower than previously seen in patients with SARS and MERS. Age, lymphocyte count, respiratory rate, and pulmonary opacity score at admission were identified as independent risk factors for developing respiratory failure. \n \nFunding Statement: This work was supported, in part, by the research Grant 2020YFC0843700 67 from Ministry of Science and Technology of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \nDeclaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests. \n \nEthics Approval Statement: The Ethics Committee of Zhongda Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University approved this study (2020ZDSYLL013\u2013P01 and 2020ZDSYLL019\u2013P01).

    "abstract": "This study uses an in silico screening docking model to evaluate the ACE2 inhibitory activity of natural compounds and drugs. The study collected 49 compounds and evaluated the ACE2 inhibitory effect in silico. The study results show that 11 out of the 49 compounds had stronger inhibitory activity on ACE2 than MLN-4760. Lipinski\u2019s rule of five criteria and predictive pharmacokinetic-toxicity analysis show that eight compounds including quercetin, galangin, quisinostat, fluprofylline, spirofylline, RS 504393, TNP and GNF-5 had drug-likeness.

    "title": "JNS: an update on citation \u2018impact\u2019 and remit",
    "abstract": "The Journal of Nutritional Science (JNS) was launched some 9 years ago, the first articles appearing in February 2012. The journal was jointly established by the Nutrition Society and Cambridge University Press as a pioneering Open Access forum covering the full spectrum of nutritional science. At the beginning, it was closely linked with the British Journal of Nutrition, established 74 years ago in 1947, with a common Editor-in-Chief and Editorial Board. The role of Editor-in-Chief is no longer shared between the two journals, although there is still considerable overlap in the composition of the Editorial Boards. JNS has attracted a wide range of studies, and some articles have been highly cited. Indeed, a review paper on flavonoids by Panche et al. in 2016 has, at the time of writing, received >450 citations according to the Scopus and Web of Science databases (and with a high \u2018Altmetrics score\u2019 for those engaging with this metric). Citations are, of course, a reflection of interest and influence \u2013 of \u2018impact\u2019. There are several databases which provide data on citation impact, whether for individual articles or for specific journals, particularly Journal Citation Reports (Clarivate), CiteScore (Elsevier), Google Scholar and Dimensions. CiteScore, which is one of the more recent, was launched in December 2016 as part of Scopus \u2013 itself a comprehensive database of peer-reviewed research. CiteScore has several attractions, including that it covers a window of 4 years (originally 3), the 2019 figures being based on articles published in 2016\u201319; a period of 3 years is considered to cover the citation peak in the majority of disciplines. A further major attraction is that a CiteScore is provided once a journal is included within the Scopus database, no special request or evaluation is required. As a consequence, it can become available soon after a new journal is successfully launched. JNS has had a CiteScore essentially since the inception of the database and the metrics for 2019 were released in June 2020, as calculated by Scopus on 31 May of this year. I am delighted to say that our journal has done extremely well \u2013 a value of 9\u22c54. It should be noted that CiteScore employs only a single decimal place in order to avoid an inappropriate sense of precision. CiteScore currently lists JNS under two subject areas: \u2018Agricultural and Biological Sciences \u2013 Food Science\u2019, where it ranks 9th out of 299 (97th percentile), and \u2018Medicine \u2013 Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism\u2019, where it is ranked 20th out of 217 (91st percentile). Most other nutrition journals are listed under \u2018Nursing \u2013 Nutrition and Dietetics\u2019 where JNS would now rank 7th out of 120 (93rd percentile); we have requested that it is also included under this category. In each case, JNS would rank in the 1st quartile of journals in the designated subject area; indeed, it would rank in the top 10 %. Such high rankings clearly represent an exceptional performance on the part of JNS, which I very much hope that our authors \u2013 both past and future \u2013 will appreciate. I would also like to highlight that JNS is now willing to publish articles that report negative results \u2013 providing that they make a genuine contribution to nutritional knowledge (and are, of course, scientifically sound). Such articles might challenge current perspectives, for example, or demonstrate the inability to reproduce important recent findings. This adds to the type of article that we currently publish \u2013 \u2018Primary Research Papers\u2019, \u2018Brief Reports\u2019, \u2018Review Articles\u2019, \u2018Systematic Reviews\u2019, \u2018Perspectives in Nutritional Science\u2019, \u2018Workshop Reports\u2019, \u2018Letters to the Editor\u2019 and \u2018Obituaries\u2019 \u2013 although most submissions reporting negative results are likely to be \u2018Primary Research Papers\u2019 or \u2018Brief Reports\u2019. We look forward to receiving manuscripts in this new category.",

    "title": "Research on the Construction and Performance Analysis of Collaborative Innovation Network of theIndustry-University-Research-Finance",
    "abstract": "Under the background of open innovation, an important issue of the country to promote the development of technology innovation is construction and performance evaluation of the collaborative innovation network for the Industry-University-Research-Finance(IURF). This paper expanded the scope of innovation subjects of the traditional collaborative innovation network, and constructed a collaborative innovation network, including of the main innovation subjects, such as enterprises, universities, research institutions and financial institutions. Combined with the typical strategic emerging industry cluster innovation network, this paper analyzes the case, and gives the countermeasures and suggestions to improve the performance of the network, which provides a reference for the development of the network. In the open innovation environment, with the development of the integration of science, technology and economy, collaborative innovation networkof IURF has become the first choice to realize the knowledge creation, diffusion and industrialization. It is a cross organizational knowledge exchange and knowledge transfer network, which takes the innovation subjects such as enterprises, universities, scientific research institutions, as well as the exogenous influencing factors such as science and technology service institutions, governments, financial investment institutions as a whole, and takes the realization of technological innovation and the transformation of scientific and technological achievements as the main purpose.At present, a large number of strategic emerging industry cluster innovation networks have sprung up in China, such as Zhongguancun, which has the title of \"the world's first innovation cluster in the future\"; Shanghai Zizhu emerging industry technology research institute, which was founded in Shanghai in 2010; and Xi'an Yanliang National Aviation High Technology Industry base.They are all the collaborative innovation network of IURF, they play an irreplaceable role in the process of scientific and technological innovation and transformation of scientific and technological achievements. In the process of science and technology innovation, the role of technology finance is prominent. The Ministry of science and technology and governments at all levels had realized the importance of the coordinated development of science finance and science innovation.In recent years, the government, together with the people's Bank of China, China Banking Regulatory Commission, the Ministry of Finance and other departments, has issued a number of financial policy documents focusing on promoting scientific and technological innovation. Under the guidance of the government, many new financial service institutions have been established in the strategic emerging industry cluster park. Therefore, it is a necessary process for technological innovation and development to transform financial institutions from exogenous influencing factors in collaborative innovation network of IUFR into an important innovation subject like enterprises, universities and scientific research institutions to form the network, strengthen the integration innovation of industries, universities and research funds, and promote economic and social development. According to the report of \"Statistical analysis on the national main science and technology plan of transformation and application of achievements in 2014 \" released by the Innovation and Development Department of the Ministry of Science and Technology on January 14, 2016, 9302 subjects were tracked and investigated throughout the year, of which 4906 subjects failed to be transformed and applied, accounting for 52.7% of the total subjects. Although the number of 2020 International Conference on Social and Human Sciences (ICSHS2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000224 ISBN: 978-1-80052-000-4 1197 transformation of various subjects has increased by 2 to 3 percentage points on average compared with the previous year, the transformation rate of scientific and technological achievements still has a lot of room for improvement. According to the data, among the achievements that had not yet been transformed, 47.8% (2012), 49.2% (2013), 43.1% (2014) of the total achievements had not been transformed due to the funds needed for transformation and application, industrial supporting technology, relevant technical personnel and cooperative units. Among them, 31.1% (2012), 30.1% (2013) and 27.1% (2014) of the total untranslated achievements were not fully funded. The reason is that technology finance has not kept up with the development speed of science and technology innovation, the integration of industries, universities and research funds is not smooth, and the organization mode of IUFR has not been clarified. This paper will explore and analyze the reasons for the low conversion rate of scientific and technological achievements, in order to provide more valuable theoretical and practical reference for scientific and technological innovation management.",

    "title": "Characteristics of Ozone Concentration in Shangqiu City and its Countermeasures",
    "abstract": "This article uses the air quality monitoring data of Shangqiu City to statistically analyze the characteristics of O3 concentration changes in the near-surface layer of Shangqiu City from 2016 to 2019. The characteristics of O3 in the peak period of spring, summer, early autumn and daily 10: 00-18: 00 , Put forward countermeasures for O3 pollution prevention. Introduction Ozone is one of the important substances in the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Studies have found that high concentrations of O3 near the ground can harm human health, affect plant growth and the quality of the urban atmospheric environment. Generally speaking, photochemical reactions are the dominant source of near-surface O3, and high-concentration O3, as a characteristic product of urban photochemical smog, has become one of the hot issues in the field of international atmospheric science research. Shangqiu City is located in the easternmost part of Henan Province, where the four provinces of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces meet. With the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, the concentration of O3 shows an upward trend, and the ozone pollution problem caused by it has become increasingly prominent. Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out ozone analysis and research. 1. Methods and Materials The pollutant concentration data used in this paper are from the monitoring data of 4 stations in Shangqiu City from 2016 to 2019. O3-8h is also called ozone 8-hour moving average, that is, the largest continuous 8-hour O3 concentration in a day is used as a standard to evaluate the ozone pollution level on that day. The city-wide average refers to the average of 4 stations. The data is selected from data sources with at least 3 sites, that is, the values that form valid data. The seasons are divided into spring (March-May), summer (June-August), autumn (September-November), and winter (December-February). This paper uses the air quality monitoring data of Shangqiu City to statistically analyze the time variation characteristics of O3 pollution near the ground layer in Shangqiu City, and proposes prevention measures. 2. Results and Analysis 2.1 Seasonal Change Characteristics Table 1 Statistics of ozone concentration in Shangqiu City from 2016 to 2018 Years Numbe r of samples Average/ (\u03bcg/m3) Max value/ (\u03bcg/m3) Exceede d days/ d Excessive Days Ratio/% 2016 362 99 217 34 9.39 2020 Conference on Social Science and Modern Science (SSMS2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000808 ISBN: 978-1-80052-004-2 -585Year 2017 Years 364 108 244 56 15.38 2018 Year 357 111 253 67 18.77 Total 1083 / / / 14.50 Table 1 summarizes the actual monitoring data of O3 in Shangqiu City from 2016 to 2018. From January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018, the annual average ozone concentration in Shangqiu City increased from 99 \u03bcg / m3 in 2016 to 111 \u03bcg / m3, and the average ozone concentration increased year by year. From January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018, the total number of monitoring days was 1083d, and the O3-8h concentration exceeded the standard for 157d, which accounted for 14.50% of the total monitoring days. Among them, the number of exceeded days in 2016 was 34 days and the number of days in 2017 was 56d. In 2018, it was 67d, and the number of days with O3-8h concentration exceeding the standard showed an upward trend year by year. 2.2 Seasonal Changes The O3 monitoring data of Shangqiu City from March 2016 to February 2019 were collected to obtain its seasonal change characteristics. Figure 1 shows that the seasonal concentration of O3 is generally the highest in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and the lowest in winter, and the overall seasonal change trend over the three years is exactly the same. The difference between the highest and lowest spring averages of 1\u03bcg / m3 in the three seasons is not much changed; the highest and lowest difference in summer is 11\u03bcg / m3; the highest and lowest difference in autumn is 11\u03bcg / m3; Shangqiu City is in a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons, and has the characteristics of cold winter and hot summer. The small changes in the same season for the three seasons show that the ozone concentration in Shangqiu is closely related to the meteorological conditions. According to the data analysis, the ozone concentration data points in the spring and summer are relatively concentrated in the three seasons, generally in high-concentration areas. The highest ozone concentration is basically in the early summer of June, the ozone concentration in the autumn is relatively scattered, and the ozone concentration in September is more. Distributed in high-concentration areas, the ozone concentration in October-November is basically in the low-concentration area, and the ozone concentration in winter is in the low-concentration area. The data are relatively concentrated. It shows that the sunshine and solar radiation in spring and summer are relatively strong seasons of the year, which are prone to photochemical reactions. When the precursors such as nitrogen oxides and VOCs are the same, high concentrations of ozone are likely to occur. With the development of the prevention and control of atmospheric pollution in 2016, the main pollutant PM2.5 weakened in summer and autumn, which led to the reduction of the aerosol optical thickness, enhanced the photochemical generation rate of O3, and the O3 concentration tended to increase. The solar radiation in spring and autumn is still sufficient, the hours of sunshine are long, and the ozone concentration is still at a high level. However, with the rapid decline of temperature, solar radiation, and sunshine hours from November to February, it is not conducive to photochemical reactions, so the ozone concentration in winter the lowest season.",

    "abstract": "A wealth of information about how parasites interact with their hosts already exists in collections, scientific publications, specialized databases, and grey literature. The US National Science Foundation-funded Terrestrial Parasite Tracker Thematic Collection Network (TPT) project began in 2019 to help build a comprehensive picture of arthropod ectoparasites including the evolution of these parasite-host biotic associations, distributions, and the ecological interactions of disease vectors. TPT is a network of biodiversity collections whose data can assist scientists, educators, land managers, and policymakers to better understand the complex relationship between hosts and parasites including emergent properties that may explain the causes and frequency of human and wildlife pathogens. TPT member collections make their association information easier to access via Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI, Poelen et al. 2014), which is periodically archived through Zenodo to track progress in the TPT project. TPT leverages GloBI's ability to index biotic associations from specimen occurrence records that come from existing management systems (e.g., Arctos, Symbiota, EMu, Excel, MS Access) to avoid having to completely rework existing, or build new, cyber-infrastructures before collections can share data. TPT-affiliated collection managers use collection-specific translation tables to connect their verbatim (or original) terms used to describe associations (e.g., \"ex\", \"found on\", \"host\") to their interpreted, machine-readable terms in the OBO Relations Ontology (RO). These interpreted terms enable searches across previously siloed association record sets, while the original verbatim values remain accessible to help retain provenance and allow for interpretation improvements. \n TPT is an ambitious project, with the goal to database label data from over 1.2 million specimens of arthropod parasites of vertebrates coming from 22 collections across North America. In the first year of the project, the TPT collections created over 73,700 new records and 41,984 images. In addition, 17 TPT data providers and three other collaborators shared datasets that are now indexed by GloBI, visible on the TPT GloBI project page. These datasets came from collection specimen occurrence records and literature sources. Two TPT data archives that capture and preserve the changes in the data coming from TPT to GloBI were published through Zenodo (Poelen et al. 2020a, Poelen et al. 2020b). The archives document the changes in how data are shared by collections including the biotic association data format and quantity of data captured. The Poelen et al. 2020b report included all TPT collections and biotic interactions from Arctos collections in VertNet and the Symbiota Collection of Arthropods Network (SCAN). The total number of interactions included in this report was 376,671 records (500,000 interactions is the overall goal for TPT). In addition, close coordination with TPT collection data managers including many one-on-one conversations, a workshop, and a webinar (Sullivan et al. 2020) was conducted to help guide the data capture of biotic associations.\n GloBI is an effective tool to help integrate biotic association data coming from occurrence records into an openly accessible, global, linked view of existing species interaction records. The results gleaned from the TPT workshop and Zenodo data archives demonstrate that minimizing changes to existing workflows allow for custom interpretation of collection-specific interaction terms. In addition, including collection data managers in the development of the interaction term vocabularies is an important part of the process that may improve data sharing and the overall downstream data quality.",

    "title": "Editorial: Remote and Proximal Sensing of Grasslands",
    "abstract": "Even a short glance at the Web of Science clearly shows that research interest in grassland and remote sensing for monitoring purposes has increased significantly since 2010. Furthermore, research activities in using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for grassland monitoring have risen almost exponentially since 2015, with first studies using remotely controlled fixed wing or helicopter UAVs dating back to the 1990s. The answers to why grasslands have become of more interest are manifold. One reason is their diversity, ranging from natural grassland, over extensively used pastures and meadows to very intensively managed systems. Ecosystems connected with prairies, pampas, steppes, savannahs, rangelands, alpine pastures, silvo-pastoral systems, and many more characterize grasslands diversity and their global presence. Estimates show that 30\u201340% of the terrestrial land masses are covered by these grassland ecosystems. Another reason is their importance in the context of global and climate change. Soils are the largest carbon stock and the significance of grasslands in the global carbon cycle and their role as a carbon sink are well known. Furthermore, managed grasslands are an important food supplier and play an essential role in the agribusiness when it comes to producing meat, milk, cheese, wool, etc. Considering this background, the DGPF Working Group \u201cRemote Sensing Applications for Forestry and Agriculture\u201d decided to initiate special sessions on remote and proximal sensing of grasslands at the annual DGPF conference in Stuttgart in March 2020 (Stilla 2020). At the same time, the Working Group announced in 2019 a call for this special issue on the same topic. The four papers of our special issue, the presentations at the DGPF 2020 conference (2020), and the two papers of the conference proceedings clearly show the broad topics when it comes to remote sensing of grasslands. The applied sensors of the studies range from satellite to UAV sensors and include proximal sensing for grassland research. In the conference proceedings, Schaumberger and Adelw\u00f6hrer (2020) present an impressive data management system, the SpectroAnalyst, for handling spectral experiment plot data acquired with field spectroradiometers. Wachendorf et al. (2020) applied the Cubert Firefly, a hyperspectral UAV-mounted imaging sensor, to estimate forage quality and invasive species in species-rich grasslands. The authors found high R2 in forage quality estimation and established an analysis workflow to map invasive species. In this special issue, two papers present Sentinel-2 data analysis to estimate LAI for grasslands. The first one is a study by Schwieder et al. (2020, https ://doi.org/10.1007/ s4106 4-020-00120 -1) that show how Sentinel-2 data can be applied to map grassland parameters such as biomass and LAI. Similar results for LAI are presented by Klingler et al. (2020, https ://doi.org/10.1007/s4106 4-020-00119 -8) who investigated different indirect and direct methods of LAI retrieval. Both studies evaluated their Sentinel-2 data analysis using comprehensive field measurements. Wijesingha et al. (2020, https ://doi.org/10.1007/s4106 4-020-00121 -0) presented a detailed study on mapping invasive species in semi-natural grasslands using an object-based image analysis approach. In that study, UAV-derived RGB and thermal data in ultra-high resolution were acquired and analyzed. Finally, Lussem et al. (2020, https ://doi.org/10.1007/ s4106 4-020-00117 -w) use a 3-year data set to investigate the potential of low-cost UAVs and RGB data acquisition for forage mass monitoring. In general, promising remote-sensing approaches to monitoring grasslands are (1) stereo-photogrammetry to DGPF",

    "title": "Training Skills with Common-Interest Building",
    "abstract": "This fourth Synthesis of the Science Diplomacy Action series involves that pedagogy of common-interest building among allies and adversaries alike as a negotiation skill to apply, train and refine. This serial edition also represents a journey with science diplomacy and its engine of informed decisionmaking among friends who facilitated the first formal dialogue between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Russia regarding security in the Arctic, which we co-directed at the University of Cambridge in 2010. The starting point for that NATO-Russia dialogue was science diplomacy, as an holistic (international, interdisciplinary and inclusive) process to balance national interests and common interests for the benefit of all on Earth across generations. \n\nOperation of this holistic process became clear in 2016 during the 1st International Dialogue on Science and Technology Advice in Foreign Ministries, when the \u2018continuum of urgencies\u2019 was identified from security time scales (mitigating risks of political, economic, cultural and environmental instabilities that are immediate) to sustainability time scales (balancing economic prosperity, environmental protection and societal well-being across generations). The following year, the theoretical framework of informed decisionmaking \u2013 operating across a \u2018continuum of urgencies\u2019 short-term to long-term \u2013 emerged with the case study published in Science about the 2017 Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation, which has entered into force among the eight Arctic states. With continuing acceleration, in 2020, Springer published the first volume in the new book series on INFORMED DECISIONMAKING FOR SUSTAINABILITY. \n\nThe graduate course on \u201cScience Diplomacy: Environmental Security and Law in the Arctic Ocean\u201d was introduced in 2016 with the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, involving a Mock Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting as the culminating synthesis with the Student Ambassadors. Framed around their working papers for the Mock Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting, the Student Ambassadors negotiated a declaration, which they adopted by consensus and signed at end of that first semester. In subsequent years, additional holistic integration exercises were introduced into the course, including the Common-Interest Building \u2013 Training Game with the pedagogy of the seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, each of which has international, interdisciplinary and inclusive relevance at local-global levels (APPENDIX 1: Syllabus \u2013 Spring 2020).\n\nFrom 2017 through 2020, the graduate course was expanded to Science Diplomacy: Environmental Security and Law in the Arctic Ocean, involving The Fletcher School in Medford (Massachusetts, United States) and the International Law Programme at MGIMO University in Moscow (Russian Federation). Building on a Memorandum of Understanding between our institutions, this joint video-conferencing course was approved by the Russian Ministry of Education and involved Carnegie Corporation of New York funding that was directed by Prof. Paul Arthur Berkman, contributing to the soon-to-be Russia and Eurasia Program at The Fletcher School. Each year, Student Ambassadors from the United States and Russian Federation adopted and signed joint declarations by consensus, as an exercise in common-interest building. Results of training skills with common-interest building are reflected herein with the compilation of consensus declarations crafted by the Student Ambassadors in their Mock Arctic Council Ministerial Meetings from 2016 to 2020.\n\nThe essence of common-interest building is to make inormed decisions that operate across time in view of urgencies, short-term to long-term, tactical and strategic. Urgencies are embedded across diverse time scales with local-global relevance, as demonstrated by accelerating impacts through: month-years with our global pandemic; years-decades with high technologies; and decades-centuries with global human population size and atmospheric carbon-dioxide concentration in our Earth system.\n\nThe underlying process of informed decisionmaking involves holistic integration with science as the \u2018study of change\u2019, revealed with the natural sciences and social sciences as well as Indigenous knowledge, all of which characterize patterns, trends and processes (albeit with different methods) that become the bases for decisions. Contributing with research and action, the institutions involved with decisionmaking produce: governance mechanisms (laws, agreements and policies as well as regulatory strategies, including insurance, at diverse jurisdictional levels); and built infrastructure (fixed, mobile and other assets, including communication, observing, information and other systems that require technology plus investment). Coupling of governance mechanisms and built infrastructure contributes to progress with sustainability, which were weaved throughout the course with the Arctic Ocean as a case study. \n\nOutcomes of the joint-video conferencing course between The Fletcher School and MGIMO University have accelerated globally into the training initiatives with diplomatic schools among foreign ministries as well as with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). Our hope is science diplomacy and its engine of informed decisionmaking will lead to lifelong learning across the jurisdictional spectrum with its subnational-national-international legal levels for the benefit of all on Earth across generations.",

    "title": "Research on the Industrialization Inheritance of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Guizhou: A Case Study of Ethnic Songs, Dances and Operas",
    "abstract": "Guizhou Province has a large number of ethnic songs, dances and operas, which are precious intangible cultural heritage wealth. The singing and dancing art, which was produced and spread in the traditional farming society, is facing the situation of being lost because of its low practicability in today's era. Through field investigation, interviews and case studies, this paper summarized the problems existing in the inheritance of ethnic songs, dances and operas in Guizhou. In order to promote the inheritance of intangible cultural heritage, the paper put forward suggestions on the inheritance of ethnic songs, dances and operas from the perspective of developing cultural industries. The laborers, labor materials, and labor objects of cultural production are the three elements to promote the development of cultural productivity. Based on the above theory, the paper gave specific suggestions on how to improve the cultural productivity and the industrialization degree of ethnic songs, dances and operas. Keywords\u2014Intangible Cultural Heritage; Ethnic Songs, Dances and Operas; Industrialization; Inheritance; Guizhou I. RESEARCH BACKGROUND In 2017, general secretary Xi Jinping stressed that \u201ccreative transformation and innovative development of Chinese traditional culture\u201d is a scientific guidance for the better transmission and development of traditional culture in the present era. At the \u201c40th Anniversary Session of Reform and Opening up\u201d in 2018, Xi Jinping emphasized again: \u201cpromoting the creative transformation and innovative development of Chinese traditional culture, carrying forward revolutionary culture and developing advanced culture.\u201d This guided us to use China's excellent traditional culture scientifically, develop cultural industry, prosper cultural undertakings and meet the people\u2019s growing needs for a better life. From 2009 to 2018, the proportion of added value of China\u2019s culture and related industries in GDP increased year by year, from 2.54% in 2009 to 4.30% in 2018. According to the general standard that the pillar industry accounts for 5% of GDP, the cultural industry will soon become the pillar industry of the national economy. With the development of technologies such as the Internet, virtual reality, and block chain, new formats and new models of cultural industry are constantly emerging and developing rapidly. They are increasingly becoming new growth points for cultural industry and have spawned new creative industries and creative economies. Intangible cultural heritage comes from the way of production and life of human beings. It exists on the basis of human beings and embodies people\u2019s aesthetics, beliefs, values and creativity. Intangible cultural heritage is a \u201cliving\u201d culture. The ethnic songs, dances and operas, which integrate images, sounds and techniques, are more appealing \u201cliving\u201d arts. Under the background of the development of cultural industry, how to creatively transform and develop national cultural resources such as ethnic songs, dances and operas, and how to develop life vitality relying on new technology are not only the needs of intangible cultural heritage protection but also the needs of people\u2019s spiritual and cultural life. II. THE BASIS OF ETHNIC SONGS, DANCES AND OPERAS RESOURCES IN GUIZHOU Guizhou has a long history of many ethnic groups, and the characteristics of various ethnic groups living together form a colorful ethnic culture. Singing and dancing is the most basic entertainment and social activity for ethnic minorities in Guizhou. Rest and work, walking and driving, love and marriage, and funeral ancestors are all inseparable from singing and dancing. Singing and dancing is a way for people to express their feelings and convey their beliefs, which is integrated into every detail of people\u2019s life. There are countless wonderful ethnic songs, dances and operas in the minority areas of Southeast Guizhou, Northwest Guizhou, Northeast Guizhou and South Guizhou. The Grand Song of Dong Minority, Miao\u2019s Flying Song, Yi\u2019s Bell Dance, Buyi\u2019s Eight Notes Sitting Singing, Nuo Opera and so on fully show the rich spiritual world of Guizhou people. As of 2019, 85 items (140 sites) of intangible cultural heritage in Guizhou have been included in the National Intangible Heritage List, and 628 items (1026 sites) of intangible cultural heritage have been included in the Provincial Intangible Heritage List. There are 23 national intangible cultural heritages (see Table I), accounting for 27% of the total number of intangible cultural heritages in Guizhou. This shows the important position of ethnic songs, dances and operas in the production and life of Guizhou people.

    "title": "Use of the Interoperable Artificial Pancreas System for Type 1 Diabetes Management During Psychological Stress",
    "abstract": "Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have not been designed to account for psychological and physiological stress in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Prior studies have noted psychological stress can cause an increase in catecholamine and cortisol levels and can impair insulin sensitivity,1,2 with acute stress affecting postprandial glucose levels.3 We have reported that psychological stress can also cause changes in glucose variability, with potential increases in the number of low blood glucose readings and altered behavior, such as reduced carbohydrate intake.4 We enhanced our zone-model predictive control algorithm running on the Harvard University interoperable Artificial Pancreas System5 using a continuous function of glucose velocity and insulin-on-board to gradually increase insulin infusion under conditions of sustained hyperglycemia, while retaining the previous design to protect from controllerinduced hypoglycemia, as a potential improvement for treatment of stress-induced hyperglycemia. We piloted at-home use of the system in two adults with T1D (64-year-old male, A1c 5.3% and a 31-year-old female, A1c 6.0%) over a two-week period in a randomized crossover comparison to sensor-augmented pump (SAP) (NCT04142229) at Sansum Diabetes Research Institute in California and Mayo Clinic in Minnesota during March and April of 2020. Although neither subject was diagnosed with COVID-19, both subjects encountered multiple psychological stressors related to the pandemic, including job loss, closing of the study clinical centers, cancellation of the planned formal psychological and physiological stress induction sessions, challenges in purchasing food for themselves and their families, and adhering to strict isolation rules. Electrodermal activity (EDA) measurements were collected throughout each day using the Empatica E4 wristband (Empatica Srl, Milano, Italy) as a biomarker of stress. Both subjects were randomized to the AID arm first. Comparing both arms, subjects had good glycemic control during SAP use, with Subject 1 having 90.3% sensor glucose time-in-range (TIR) 70-180 mg/dL overall and 87.1% overnight, and Subject 2 having 71.2% TIR overall and 71% overnight. This high TIR with SAP use also came at the cost of significant amount of hypoglycemia, in particular for Subject 1, who had 6.7% time <70 mg/dL overall, and 11% time <70 mg/dL overnight. During the two weeks of AID use, for Subject 1, TIR 70-180 mg/dL increased to 92% overall and to 89.4% overnight, with a decrease in time <70 mg/ dL to 3.1% overall and to 1% overnight. For Subject 2, TIR 70-180 mg/dL increased to 84.6% overall and to 94% overnight, with a decrease in time <70 mg/dL to 0.5% overall and to 0.1% overnight (Figure 1). Continuous decomposition analysis of EDA,6 defining a stress event as a response amplitude of at least 0.5 microSiemens, showed a greater number of events per day in the SAP arm for Subject 1 (median [interquartile range {IQR}]: 82.0 [167.0] vs 23.0 [20.0]) as well as for Subject 2 (median [IQR]: 122.5 [62.0] vs 56.0 [121.5]). 948566 DSTXXX10.1177/1932296820948566Journal of Diabetes Science and TechnologyPinsker et al letter2020",

    "abstract": "Sericulture, the production of raw silk by means of raising caterpillars. Sericulture is our important agro-based rural industry that helps our economy and generates higher income and employment. It is practiced in a wide range of agro-climatic regions like forests, hilly areas and plains. In fact, the recent technological advancements have made it possible to practice it on an intensive scale, mainly due to increased profits obtained from it as compared to most of the crops and enterprises. Sericulture has a special place among the agro-based cottage industry of our country. The government of India initiated various programmes to promote sericulture in the country, following which sericulture took a rapid slide towards progress, emerging as one of the most economically viable, small scale agro-based industries. Hence the present study was undertaken to find out the adoption level of the sericulture farmers towards improved sericulture technology with respect to socio-economic profile of the farmers of Udalguri block of Udalguri district, Assam. The study revealed that most of the respondents (43.33%) had medium level of Adoption followed by low (28.34%) and high (28.33%). KEYWORDSSericulture, Adoption level, Socio-economic profile INTRODUCTION Sericulture in India has turned out to be a highly remunerative enterprise with minimum capital base and yielding reasonably good returns vis-a-vis other enterprises. Sericulture effectively transfers urban wealth to rural producers. It provides not only periodical return within a short period of time but also assure potential family employment opportunities around the year. A large chunk of labour is employed in all the sericulture activities and the industry is a boon to the labour-surplus countries like India. Sericulture also employs a sizable show of women labour. The women participation in sericulture ranges between 55 and 60 percent. HISTORY The ancient literature gives two views. According to one view, silk industry originated for the first time in India at the foot of the Himalayas, and from there it spread to the other countries of the world. Second view which has a great acceptance, says that this industry originated in China about 3000B.C. According to historians, now silk was exported from India to Rome during the reign of Kanishka in 58 B-C. Silk has a place of pride in the social and cultural lives of Indians, since it is superior to other textile fibers in qualities like durability, luster and low weight. Hence, it is regarded as the \u201cqueen of textiles\u201d(Li, 2012). METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION Primary Data Collection: The primary data has been collected through survey and observation.

    "title": "Prognostic Indicators in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in a Moroccan Population",
    "abstract": "HCC is the most common primary liver tumor with a high mortality rate. The prognosis for HCC on cirrhosis is generally poor and seems to be determined not only by factors linked to the tumor, but also by factors linked to cirrhosis. The main objective of our study is to determine prognostic factors in cirrhotic patients with HCC. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis liver diagnosed from January 2009 to July 2019. The diagnosis of HCC was made according to the non-invasive criteria of EASL with the use of histology for doubtful cases. Multivariate analysis was performed with a binary logistic regression model to identify prognostic factors. Results: Out of 148 patients with HCC on cirrhosis liver, the average age is 64 [18; 72] years with a predominance of female. The etiology of cirrhosis was viral B/C in 79.7%. Child's score was \u2265 B7 in 35.8%. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) exceeded >400 ng/ml in 28.3%. Invasion of the portal vein was objectified in 15.9% with the presence of metastases in 19%. Only 22.9% patients had curative treatment. Palliative means interested 77% of patients. The 1-year and 5-year survival were 68.7% and 27%, respectively. The prognostic indicators of death were respectively advanced child (p=0.005), AFP level >400 ng/ml (p=0.02) and presence of metastasis (p <0.001) Conclusion: Hepatocellular carcinoma remains a tumor J Cancer Sci Clin Ther 2020; 4 (2): 115-119 DOI: 10.26502/jcsct.5079057 Journal of Cancer Science and Clinical Therapeutics 116 with poor prognosis.

    "title": "Application of a combination between Principal Component Analysis and Logistic Regression Based on Support Vector Machine on Educational Data Mining with Overlapping Data Problem",
    "abstract": "In 2019, the government of the Republic of Indonesia issued a zoning-based policy for New Student Admissions (PPDB) from the level of elementary school (SD) to high school (SMA), especially for public schools. The policy is documented in Permendikbud No.51 / 2018. The government policy aims to ensure the equality of education and make prospective students not focus only on favorite schools. However, this policy raises new problems. One of them is that if the potential student has got a medium UN (National Examination) score or medium distance of the house to the destination school, then his potential to be accepted at the destination school is very small. It is even worse if the potential students do not know the lowest score and the farthest distance the destination school can accept. Thus, potential students will choose schools by only guessing without basing on valid data, so their chances of being accepted will be very small. This current research focused on Educational Data Mining at PPDB Public High School (SMA) in Jombang in the academic year 2019/2020 which aims to accommodate the needs of potential students to predict the destination schools based on their own grades and home distances using classification techniques of data mining. However, another problem emerged in this study. An overlapping data occurred where one data was also owned by more than one class. For example, a potential student of SMA Negeri 2 Jombang (SMAN 2 Jombang) has got a score of 80 in Bahasa Indonesia subject, which is the same as that of a student from SMA Negeri 3 Jombang (SMAN 3 Jombang). Data overlapping does not only occur in one data but almost all of the data. The data used in this study were 600 data, consisting of 308 from PPDB 2019 of SMAN 2 Jombang, and the rest were from SMAN 3 Jombang. The attributes used were the home distance from the destination school, overall UN scores, UN scores of Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Bahasa Indonesia, and English subjects. The algorithm used was a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Logistic Regression (LR)-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Anova kernel. The validation applied 10-fold cross-validation and the evaluation of algorithm performance used the aspects of accuracy, precision, and recall. The results of this current study showed an accuracy of 94.33%, a precision of 96.28%, and a recall of 92.53%. The results were better than those that did not apply PCA (70.83% accuracy, 69.62% precision, and 76.62% recall). By PCA, data could be seen from another angle that could separate or differentiate one class from the others. Even though there were 100% overlapping data, none of them, from all attributes, was 100% exactly the same.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Precisely, the goal of the device is to initiate a friction force between the delivery system and the arterial vessel wall to both assure immediate stent deployment and prevent axial advancement of the stent-anchoring wire. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A prototype was constructed and its effectiveness of applying a friction force to a vessel wall was tested ex vivo using an LRX Plus Materials Testing Machine. Afterwards, the experimental performance of the device was compared to that of a finite element simulated model. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The device demonstrated the ability to apply a friction force to the vessel wall to meet its objective. However, experimental values were consistently greater than those gathered from the simulation. Since the force prescribed by the device is minimal, future work includes increasing the force capabilities of the device and defining force requirements. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Upon further development and testing, this device can be implemented into endovascular neurosurgery to improve occlusion rates of intracranial aneurysms and reduce patient risk during these operations. CONFLICT OF INTEREST DESCRIPTION: I am pursuing intellectual property on this invention. I was careful not to describe the invention in too much detail in my abstract submission for this reason. This research is my thesis work, and I placed on one year embargo on it before it is published to give us time to sort out IP.

    "title": "Prevalence andRisk Factors of Hypertension among Elderly Population in Social Welfare Center Old Age Home, Pashupati, Kathmandu",
    "abstract": "Background: Hypertension is a chronic condition of concern due to its role in causing coronary heart disease, stroke, and other vascular complications. It is one of the most important reasons behind premature death in a developing country. Many Factors like Socio-Demographic, economic, Educational, and behaviorrelated factors influence hypertension. The study's objective was to identify the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among the elderly population in Social Welfare Center Old Age Home Pashupati, Kathmandu. Methodology: A cross-sectional population-based study was carried out in Social Welfare Center Old Age Home Pashupati, Kathmandu. Among 109 subjects of people aged 60 and above were selected through a purposive sampling technique and a census was done. A semi-structured questionnaire was used for collecting data, and a sphygmomanometer was used to measure the blood pressure. Results: Among the 109 respondents involved in the study, the mean age was 74 years. The prevalence of hypertension among the elderly was 13.8 percent, 19.6 percent among males, and 9.5 percent among females. In Marital status, Married elderly was significantly associated with hypertension. Married elderly were 3.5 times more likely to be hypertensive (COR=3.583, 95% CI=1.027-12.504) compared to separated (divorced, widow). In health-related information, bad health status was 3.7 times more likely to be hypertensive (COR=3.773, 95% CI=1.087-13.091) compared to good health status. Respondents who know the correct answer about hypertension were four times more likely to be hypertensive (COR=4.065, 95% CI=1.279-12.919) compared to those who did know about the incorrect answer. Conclusion: The prevalence of hypertension is among these elderlies was lower compared to the national average. However, they need regular monitoring and health checkup. The study also recommends counseling on a positive marital relationship for the elderly residing in an old-age home. The study also recommends further studies with larger samples.

Ijsrm.Human, 2020; Vol. 17 (1): 176-185. 177 INTRODUCTION Hypertension is a chronic condition of concern due to its role in the causation of coronary heart disease, stroke, and other vascular complications. It is the commonest cardiovascular disorder, posing a major public health challenge to the socio-economic and epidemiological transition population. It is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular mortality, which accounts for 2050% of all death. (1, 2) Hypertension is known as high or raised blood pressure, and also as a silent killer disease, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. It is a major public health problem in developing countries like Nepal. It is a precursor to major diseases like myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal failure etc. (3) Individuals were classified as hypertensive if their systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 140 mmHg or higher and if their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 90 mmHg or higher, according to the cutoff points recommended by WHO (WHO 1999). (4) Hypertension is a major global public health problem. LMIC contribute nearly two-thirds of the mortality attributable to hypertension. It is in increasing trend in the South-Asian population. Several studies conducted in hypertension suggested that its onset occurs in the early life stage and is often associated with many CVDs risk factors. (5) High blood pressure is one of the most important reasons behind premature death worldwide killing 9.4 million people every year globally. The highest prevalence of raised blood pressure was found in the African region, i.e., 46%. In the South \u2013East Asia region, 36% of adults have hypertension. Nepal reported 2 highest proportion of hypertensive people after Afghanistan. In this region, one in three adults has high blood pressure. (6) Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular and renal diseases. Its prevalence is in increasing trend. Essential hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure that is persistently >140mmHg, or a diastolic blood pressure persistently >90mmHg, when an average of each is measured at every visit using at least two values. (7) Although hypertension is not considered to be part of the normal aging process as per epidemiological evidence, age is linked with the development of hypertension, which is the result of lifestyle factor, stress, genetic disposition, etc.(8) Those who are diagnosed may not have www.ijsrm.humanjournals.com Citation: Janak Kumar Thapa et al. Ijsrm.Human, 2020; Vol. 17 (1): 176-185. 178 access to treatment due to various reasons and may not be able to control their illness over the long term successfully. Early initiation to control behavioral risk factors like high salt intake, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, etc can reduce hypertension risk. (9) Hypertension is a worldwide burden and is one of the leading causes of mortality. It develops lots of complications rapidly with different stages and leading to death. (10) Hypertension is a major contributing factor for NCDs in both developed and developing countries. Although the rate of hypertension is rising in developed countries such as the USA as well as in lowerand middle-income countries (LMIC). (11) Hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly population and most prevalent in urban areas. By the year 2020, non-communicable diseases are expected to account for 7 out of every 10 deaths in the developing regions. Current estimates on the global burden of hypertension need to be more prioritized by public health. (12, 13) The prevalence of hypertension is in increasing in the elderly population in Nepal. As per the study conducted in Banepa, the prevalence of hypertension in people aged 50 years and more was 44.9% (male 47.75% and female 42.73%). (14)",

    "abstract": "Active surveillance cultures (ASCs) are universal or targeted microbiological screening cultures for patients admitted to a hospital. Healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) are a major health problem worldwide. Inanimate surfaces and equipment contamination may play a role in cross-transmission of pathogens and subsequent patient colonization or infection. Bacteria contaminate inanimate surfaces and equipment of the patient zone and healthcare area, generating a reservoir of potential pathogens, including multidrug resistant species. Traditional terminal cleaning methods have limitations. Indeed patients who receive a bed from prior patient carrying bacteria are exposed to an increased risk of being colonized and potentially infected by the same bacterial species of the previous patient., even on dry surfaces, may play a role in reducing the efficacy of terminal cleaning procedures since it enables bacteria to survive in the environment for a long period and provides increased resistance to commonly used disinfectants. This study aimed to: explore prevalence of bacteria in different isolated samples from various departments. To identify the risk factors associated with gram negative bacilli and gram positive gram positive cocci colonization in both patients and healthcare personnel (HCP). And to assess the association between surface contamination, HCP colonization and patients colonization. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the year 2017 in the period between one April and 31 September, on 66 healthcare personnel (HCP) and 460 patients within 24 hours of admission, age ranged from one day to 85 years old, 1270 Journal of Environmental Sciences (JES) Institute of Environmental Studies and Research, Ain Shams University Abd Rabu, Nermeen et al. Vol.(49); Iss.(8); No.(1); August 2020 ISSN 1110-0826 144 surveillance cultures (SC) were received at the microbiology department at a hospital in Cairo. The response rates of this study were 77.5% of patients and 50 % of HCP. The HCP and patients swabs' results showed that the two most infectious departments were Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) followed by Neonate Intensive Care Unit then the least infectious department compared to the previous departments was Surgery departments. The results of environmental swabs showed that 70% of gram positive bacteria including Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) were monitored on Surgery department beds. The prevalence of gram negative bacilli and gram positive cocci carriage is (53.7% of patients and HCP). Monitoring and eradication of MRSA and Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria from patients and HCP should be considered to prevent continuous spread between healthcare facilities and the community.",

Protectionism is increasing due to most industrialized countries are less open to imports from developing countries. High tariffs on manufactured goods were universally a mercantilist policy.

    "title": "Study on the Reform of Public Physical Education in Private Universities of Arts",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the private universities have developed rapidly, the enrollment scale has continued to expand, and the benefits have continued to increase. As an important part of higher education in China, the proportion of college students in private universities in the total number of college students in our country is increasing, and private universities undoubtedly provide more opportunities for young people to enter colleges and universities. Therefore, the status of teaching reform has gradually increased in the status of private universities. In order to improve the quality of teaching, private universities have paid more and more attention to the investment in teaching reform, and have continuously explored and practiced excellent teaching methods. The universities of arts are a distinctive branch of colleges and universities. With the development of the times, new art majors have emerged endlessly. Therefore, based on the same number of original professional enrollments, the total enrollment of art colleges is continuously increasing. Most students in universities of arts are reluctant to actively participate in public physical education. At the same time, the content of the original physical education curriculum is currently old and cannot meet the real needs of college students. This article mainly explores and studies the reform of public physical education in private universities of arts. Public physical education in colleges may be the last systematic physical skills learning accepted by most students in the school. It has a huge impact on the physical and mental development of college students, especially on physical health. It also concerns whether college students can successfully complete college studies on time. Therefore, public physical education in colleges should be paid more attention. Since the implementation of the Decision of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Deepening Educational Reform and Comprehensively Promoting Quality-oriented Education, China has set off a wave of improvement in education quality and education reform, and schools in various places have proposed their own reform plans. Public schools are invested by the government in teaching and economy with relatively high financial support and research at the forefront. In contrast, private universities are clearly neglected. There is personal investment, but they can receive limited investment. The concept and management of private universities are also limited by channels, and students have their own characteristics. This is why private universities should reform public physical education in accordance with the characteristics of schools. Therefore, public physical education in universities needs to be reformed. It should change the way of traditional physical education, remove the restrictions of the rules, and carry out physical activities by using more diverse natural and social conditions, breaking the tradition and gaining new innovative experience of private physical education courses. 1. Characteristics of Private Universities 1.1 Distribution Characteristics of National Universities of Arts Universities of arts aim to cultivate talents who have both arts related professional knowledge and general cultural knowledge and can engage in education and practice of various art related disciplines. At present, China has 91 universities of arts (excluding 15 independent undergraduate universities of arts), including 43 undergraduates and 48 junior colleges. At the same time, in various normal universities and comprehensive universities, there are many professional or independent departments such as music, painting, dance and performance. 2020 Conference on Educational Science and Educational Skills (ESES2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000642 ISBN: 978-1-80052-003-5 -4971.2 Particularity of Private Universities Private universities refer to non-state-owned financial resources, schools or other educational institutions organized by law by individuals other than social organizations or state institutions. In terms of structure, private universities are divided into junior college and undergraduate. According to the survey, private universities have the following characteristics. First of all, the main task of private universities is to cultivate application-oriented talents. Compared with other ordinary colleges and universities, the specialty setting has more novel, which is particularly prominent in universities of arts, and students spend more time on all kinds of practice. Secondly, private universities also have their own advantages and disadvantages. The diplomas of the better private universities have higher value. In addition, the teaching quality of some private universities is quite high, so the value of their diplomas is even higher than that of some public schools, which is normal in foreign countries. In contrast, the teaching quality of private universities in China still has a lot of room to improve. 2. The Current Status of Public Physical Education in Private Universities Each university follows the \"Three Autonomy\" model stipulated in the Guidelines for Teaching of Physical Education and Health Courses for General Colleges and Universities issued by the Ministry of Education in 2002, and is also innovating and developing sports programs with its own characteristics to increase the scope of physical education to meet students' needs for physical education and enhance students' physical fitness. 2.1 The Lack of Necessary Supervision and Guarantee Measures for Physical Education in Private Universities As mentioned above, private universities refer to non-state-owned financial resources, schools or other educational institutions organized by law by individuals other than social organizations or state institutions, which means that most private universities are funded by groups or individuals and run a special school under the guidance of a group leader or individual. Compared with public universities, the state has paid less attention to private universities, and financial support is not enough. The problem of \"marginalization\" of physical education is often overlooked, which is a serious problem. It can be seen that there is a lack of necessary standardized supervision and guarantee in private universities. 2.2 The Rigid Physical Education Teaching Model in Private Universities and the Weak Implementation Link Private universities generally have three to four years of schooling. In three-year universities, physical education is only available to freshman. Other four-year private universities set up physical education classes for freshman and sophomore. Private universities generally have lower requirements for physical education assessment of students. In addition, the physical education courses in private universities are extensive and of low importance, and the scoring system for physical education courses is not standardized. 2.3 The Low Enthusiasm for Private College Students to Participate In Extracurricular Sports Activities In recent years, the scale of private universities continues to expand and the number of enrollment continues to increase, but the construction of sports facilities such as sports fields and equipment owned by private universities has not made significant growth, which leads to the steady decline in the quality of public physical education in private universities. As a result, the number of students participating in the use of fitness resources is also decreasing. In addition, the aging and long-term non-use of fitness equipment cannot meet the sports needs of students, which leads to the reduction of physical activities in and out of class. Moreover, due to the lack of funds, venues and equipment, many private universities have not held sports competitions for many years, resulting in the lack of extracurricular physical activities. Finally, it seriously affects the enthusiasm of students",

    "title": "In the Course of Ideological and Political Theory in Colleges and Universities A study on the Path of College Students' Honesty Education",
    "abstract": "College life is a key stage for a person to establish a correct world outlook, values and outlook on life. Incorruption Education plays an important role in this critical period. It will affect the behavior choice of college students when they go out of the campus and become the backbone of the society, and will eventually play a role in the inheritance of Chinese excellent traditional culture and the reconstruction of social fashion. The ideological and Political Theory Course (hereinafter referred to as the ideological and political course) is also the key course of College Students' integrity education. How to make college students' integrity education give full play to its effectiveness in the ideological and political course is the focus of this paper. The author believes that only by combining the integrity education with the world outlook, outlook on life, ideals and beliefs, socialist core values, moral concepts, legal knowledge and other knowledge systems in the ideological and political course, and reasonably integrating the integrity education into each chapter of the theory, the combination of theoretical explanation and teaching practice, can the effectiveness of College Students' integrity education be realized in the ideological and political course. Put Forward a Question (1) The call of the CPC Central Committee on the education of College Students' integrity Corruption is a major problem in the current social development of our country, which needs an urgent outcome. In January 2013, Xi Jinping put forward in the eighteen Discipline Inspection Committee: \"corruption is a social cancer.\" If the problem of corruption is allowed to grow, it will eventually lead to the death of the party and the country's corruption. \" Corruption in the society constantly affects college students, and the corruption behaviors and phenomena of college students emerge in endlessly, such as appraising excellent students, inviting guests and gifts, bribing teachers to revise their scores, misappropriating class fees, cheating in examinations, writing homework on behalf of others, playing attendance in place of their own names, using their power for personal gain, and forging false certificates. If not, these corrupt behaviors of College Students To stop and guide correctly will seriously affect college students to establish a correct outlook on life and values. After the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) pointed out from a strategic point of view that \"we should strengthen comprehensive governance, not only to treat the symptoms and root causes, but also to punish and prevent them. We should establish and improve a system to prevent and control corruption that is suiFigure for the socialist market economic system, integrating the improvement of the system with the strengthening of education and supervision.\" Subsequently, the state has issued various documents on integrity education, as shown in Figure 1: With the promulgation of the above opinions and documents as an opportunity, college students' Incorruption Education has been raised to the height of national strategy, and its research has been 2020 Conference on Educational Science and Educational Skills (ESES2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000691 ISBN: 978-1-80052-003-5 -757strengthened in order to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee on College Students' relevant education.\ue5cf \ue5cf College Students are Important Objects of Incorruption Education Xi Jinping pointed out at the Peking University Symposium: \"the college students who are studying in Colleges and universities are about 20 years old. By the year 2020, many people were less than 30 years old when they built a well-off society in an all-round way. By the middle of this century, many people were less than 60 years old. In other words, to achieve the two centenary goals, you and millions of young people will participate in the whole process. \" In the long road of life, college life is a crucial stage. In this stage, it is necessary to establish correct values and outlook on life. Today's complex social environment and confusing trend of consciousness make some young students lose their way. In the critical period of the growth of young college students, if the first button of incorruptible education is not fastened properly, the remaining buttons will be buckled incorrectly, which will not only affect the growth and development of young students, but also affect the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Therefore, the integrity education of college students is imminent. Ideological and Political Course is the Key Course of College Students' Incorruption Education General secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: \"Ideological and political theory course is the key course to implement the basic task of Li De Shu Ren.\" The education of honest and clean government is an important part of the basic task of Building Morality and cultivating people, so the ideological and political course should also be the key course of College Students' honest and clean education. How to give full play to the role of Ideological and political courses in incorruptible education and how to give full play to its effectiveness is another important research topic proposed for ideological and political courses in Colleges and universities in the new era and new situation, which is also the focus of this paper. Definition of College Students' Incorruption Education In the opinions on Further Strengthening and improving ideological and political education of college students, the relevant contents of College Students' incorruptibility education are defined as: \"guided and led by the socialist core value system, strengthen the education of legal system and integrity, strengthen the education of social morality, professional morality and family virtue, organize and study the policies and policies of the party and the state on the construction of party conduct, incorruptibility and Anti-corruption Policies, laws and regulations, etc.\" A kind of Xia Yunqiang and Zou Lanxiang think that college students' incorruptible education refers to the practice of educators using incorruptible cultural thoughts effectively, giving students direct or indirect influence with goals, organization and planning, so that college students can enhance their consciousness of self-discipline and self-control, cultivate their psychological quality of rejecting corruption, and gradually form a professional outlook of incorruptness and devotion to work. According to Zhang Guochen, the purpose of carrying out incorruptible education in Colleges and universities is to guide college students to fully enhance their awareness of moral cultivation, laws and regulations, enhance their awareness of anti-corruption, enhance their moral quality, strengthen their scientific and cultural knowledge reserve, establish correct world outlook, outlook on life and values, and play a role in promoting the theme, inspiring and inspiring people's hearts, so as to guide college students to consciously identify themselves and actively build a solid foundation The spiritual barrier, standing on the high ground of personality, keeps a thousand pure souls. Chinese style Experts and scholars have made their own definition of College Students' incorruptibility education, which is mainly discussed from one or two aspects of values, legal consciousness, moral cultivation and professional quality, providing rich and valuable reference materials for the research of College Students' incorruptibility education. However, it seems that there are few ways to analyze the incorruptible education from the perspective of Ideological and political courses. The author tries to",

    "title": "Exploration on the Construction of Fundamentals of Robotics Innovative Course under the Background of New Engineering",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of robotics, the significance of the course construction of robotics in the construction of new engineering courses in colleges and universities in China has become increasingly prominent. Fundamentals of Robotics is an interdisciplinary course, through which students' cognitive level and innovative practical ability of robotics can be cultivated. According to the characteristics of the robotics course, it studies and explores the teaching orientation, course content, implementation method, evaluation system and construction conditions and guarantee of robotics course in this paper, and puts forward the course construction plan from the perspective of improving the innovation ability, which provides some ideas for the robot course construction. Introduction In recent years, China has become one of the fastest growing countries in the robot industry. In May 2015, the State Council officially issued Made in China 2025. In the ten strategic areas, robot is the second strategic area, its importance is self-evident. In February 2017, the Ministry of Education issued the Notice of the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education on Research and Practice of New Projects. Its main purpose is to carry out teaching methods and curriculum reform, and cultivate high-end application-oriented talents in a more effective way[1-3]. Robot has the natural attribute of high-tech content and multi-disciplinary integration. It is a good carrier to carry out a new round of engineering reform and improve the quality of teaching. Therefore, it is of great value and significance to carry out robot course construction and robot teaching task design in applied undergraduate colleges. Current Situation and Development Trend of Robot Education In May 2016, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance jointly issued the Development Plan of Robot Industry (2016-2020), which proposed the overall development goal of China's robot industry during the 13th Five Year Plan period, that is, \"To form a relatively complete robot industry system, significantly improve the technological innovation ability and international competitiveness, achieve the performance level of similar products in the world, make major breakthroughs in the quality level of key parts, and basically meet the market demand.\" Since then, the application and demand of robots in various industries have been expanding. At the same time, there are not enough high-level professionals engaged in robot system design and development, robot technology integration and robot system installation. In the National Vocational College Skills Competition Implementation Plan (2017-2020) released in September 2016, it was clearly proposed that the skills competition in the next 10 years should focus on the Made in China 2025 strategy. Therefore, as a key development field of Made in China 2025, robot will become an increasingly important direction of applied undergraduate and vocational college curriculum education and personnel training. 2020 Conference on Educational Science and Educational Skills (ESES2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000606 ISBN: 978-1-80052-003-5 -309At present, more and more science and engineering subjects in colleges and universities begin to offer robotics, robot control and other related courses for undergraduate and junior graduate students. As a science and engineering discipline of application-oriented universities, strengthening the teaching construction and reform of robotics foundation and other related courses is one of the most forward-looking and innovative development directions. Developing robot education and building related knowledge system has become the key to the development of application-oriented universities[4-5]. Analysis of Characteristics of Robotics Course Teaching Robot technology integrates many advanced technologies such as mechanics, sensing, driving, control, computer software and hardware, and artificial intelligence. The course construction of robotics is naturally complex and comprehensive. The coupling of robot technology with other disciplines should be considered. At the same time, the practicality, innovation and relevance with robot related industries should be emphasized to ensure the role and significance of robot course construction. Comprehensive and Interactive Robot research is an interdisciplinary field. It is difficult for students to fully understand the robot's mechanical structure, motion control system, sensor system and the practice of practical engineering projects only through a single course. Facing to such a multi-disciplinary course, the traditional teaching mode can not be used to design and arrange teaching tasks. It is necessary to lay out the overall goal of talent training, consider the relevance between the front and back of the curriculum, and effectively set up an all-around discipline talent training system, so as not to become a \"lonely island\" of the curriculum. Experimental and Practical Robot course has a strong demand of experiment and practice. Only through the explanation of theoretical knowledge or the simulation of virtual technology, it is difficult for students to have an intuitive and comprehensive understanding of the robot system. In general, the investment of robot experimental equipment is relatively expensive. In order to ensure that students complete the necessary hands-on operation and debugging in the process of experiment and practice, it is necessary to coordinate the overall guarantee of the course equipment and teaching environment, so as to avoid the course \"emphasizing theory and ignoring practice\". Industry and Innovation At present, the robotics course and robotics discipline in China are just starting, and the staff engaged in the robotics industry are difficult to meet the post requirements in a short period of time, so the phenomenon of application-oriented talents vacancy has formed. Based on these, on the one hand, it is necessary to evaluate the promotion and supply function of the course construction to the current robot industry environment, on the other hand, it is also necessary to consider the medium and long-term construction and innovation development of the course, so as to form a solid and powerful course construction scheme and robot innovation talent reserve. The Construction of Fundamentals of Robotics Innovative Course based on Innovative Thinking Teaching Orientation of the Course The course Fundamentals of Robotics (referred to as the course ) is a task-driven professional course that integrates theory and practice. Through good connection with the pre and follow-up courses, with the method of \"integration of theory and practice, learning and doing\", and with the goal of \"flexible learning and application of learning\", students can start from the robot body and practical",

    "abstract": "\"Serving National Special Needs Talent Training Project\" is a master degree graduates training projects, which in a certain period allow a small number of bachelor level higher education institutions with distinctive characteristics to recruit and train postgraduates for the special needs of the relevant industries in the country. However, there are still many shortcomings in the training of graduate students' innovative talents in the \"serving country special needs\" pilot universities. Therefore, we construct the \"five-in-one\" integrated innovation talent training model of graduate students from the aspects of developing graduate evaluation standards, enrollment system, training process, practice platform, degree thesis examination, etc., to comprehensively enhance the innovation ability of graduate students. At present, China has entered the information age of the rapid development of big data, Internet Plus, and etc., the quality of national innovation has become an important symbol to measure a country's comprehensive national strength and competitiveness. Building an innovative country is the core of China's development strategy and also the key to improving China's comprehensive national strength. To achieve this ambitious goal, education institutions are required to train a large number of innovative talents for social development. As a special talent training policy, \"Serving national special needs talent training project\" has become an important supplement part to the training of high-level innovative talents in China, and it also fully reflects the changes of graduate education in China which continuously adapting the social need with the development of the time. Implementation Background of the \" Serving National Special Needs Project \" \"Serving the national special needs talent training project\" bachelor's degree grant institution to carry out the training of master degree graduate students pilot work is in accordance with the state council degree committee at the 28th meeting of the decision deployed, for institutions of higher learning who do not yet have the right to grant a master's degree, in a certain period of time to recruit and train graduate students with special needs in relevant national industries and to award degrees. The colleges and universities included in the \"Serving National Special Needs Talent Training Project\" must have a high level of running schools, distinctive characteristics of running schools, and play an irreplaceable role in the training of talents in the relevant industries of the country. 2020 Conference on Educational Science and Educational Skills (ESES2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000651 ISBN: 978-1-80052-003-5 -535The evaluation and acceptance of the \"Serving National Special Needs Talent Training Project\" are based on the implementation status, and whether to continually implement the project highly depended on the running school effectiveness and the training quality of special needs talents. This implementation criterion is a significant reform of the degree authorization system, marking the changes from \"unit-based\" authorization to \"project-based\" authorization; from a comprehensive authorization that can continuously add subject points to a \"permanent\" authorization; from \"permanent\" authorization to \"within a certain period \". [1] Limitations of \"Serving the Special Needs of the Country\" Pilot University Graduate Students in the Training of Innovative Talents The Graduate Student Enrollment System is not Conducive to the Selection of Innovative Talents. In recent years, the nation keeps holding a relatively strict attitude on the general college admission policy and enrollment norms. Therefore, \"serving to the special needs of the country\" pilot colleges and universities would have few opportunities and other supportiveness from the government to reform the admission policy significantly under the current circumstance. Moreover, the graduate student recruitment selection system still follows the beaten track, with basic professional knowledge examination-based, heavy written test, and light interview. Either written test or interview assessment content rarely involves the evaluation of the candidate's innovative thinking, innovation ability, creativity, and other innovative qualities that cannot assess the candidate quality in all scope. In other words, talents trained by \"serving country special needs\" pilot colleges and universities generally have better test-taking skills and professional knowledge while having a lack of innovation ability and pioneering spirit, that the imperfect enrollment system even restricts the innovative talents' selection and training from the student source stage. Lack of Innovation Ability Training Link in Graduate Student Training Process. China's examination system always focuses on test-oriented education. Students from youth to age are accustomed to accepting the indoctrination and guidance from their teachers, with a lack of skepticism and proactive critical thinking spirit. In the postgraduate training stage, although the pilot colleges and universities have certain characteristics and could meet the national special field talent training demand, but still have not changed the training mode based on teachers' classroom teaching. The teaching content is outdated without timely teaching material updating. Also, there are few new courses offered in each year and none well-planned links to develop innovation ability. That is, from both curriculum setting and teaching methods aspects, the lack of innovative thinking practice and innovation ability training commonly exists, that resulting in the trained graduates' knowledge structure are single and lack of multi-angle thinking and broad vision. Lack of Assessment of Innovation Ability in Graduate Evaluation System. In the postgraduate stage, the examination of \"serving country special needs\" pilot college is also mainly in the form of written examination, which primarily assessing the basic knowledge and professional skills. The evaluation system is lack of innovation ability and creativity assessment. In the process of cultivation, graduate tutors generally follow the same training standards, and rarely carry out personalized training according to the expertise of each graduate student. Even the stage of the degree thesis that best reflects the innovation ability of graduate students, does not fully assess the innovation ability of graduate students. Most of the graduate degree papers are based on the research direction of the tutor, or the results of the paper formed by the research projects made with the tutor. Tutors do not fully consider the graduate students' own research expertise and the research field of interest, which could not be conducive to the cultivation of graduate students' innovation ability and creativity.",

    "title": "The Construction of Performance Evaluation Index System for Rural Tourism Poverty Alleviation",
    "abstract": "As a new poverty alleviation model, rural tourism has become one of the important weapons in the current fight against poverty. In practice, due to the difficulty in defining the cost-effectiveness of rural tourism projects and the difficulty in measuring poverty alleviation performance, it is urgent to establish a scientific rural tourism poverty alleviation performance evaluation index system. Based on the central poverty alleviation guidance document, this paper uses fuzzy quantitative models and mature measurement models to quantify quantitative and qualitative indicators respectively, and initially establishes a set of indicator systems specifically for the performance evaluation of rural tourism poverty alleviation. Taking Gulin County, Luzhou City, Sichuan Province as an example, based on this indicator system, the rural tourism performance score of Gulin County is 72 points, and its tourism poverty alleviation performance is good, which shows that the development of rural tourism has a great role in promoting poverty alleviation in Gulin County. The government should increase its support for the development of tourism poverty alleviation and maximize the effectiveness of rural tourism in poverty alleviation. 1 Summary of Research on Performance Evaluation of Rural Tourism Poverty Alleviation In 1991, the British Ministry of International Development first proposed the concept of PPT (Pro-Poor Tourism), which means tourism beneficial to the development of the poor. Zhang Wei. based on the economic and non-economic impacts of the poverty alleviation and development of tourism on the poor, the benefits and development of the poverty alleviation effects of the tourism poverty alleviation were carried out from three aspects: actual effects, perceived effects, and sustainability of effects Evaluation. Tourism poverty alleviation performance evaluation research methods can be divided into qualitative and quantitative categories. In the mid-1970s, American operations researcher T.L.saaty formally proposed the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to provide guidance for solving multi-objective, multi-criteria or complex decision-making problems without structural characteristics. Li Li and Haixia Bi used field surveys and focused on the perspectives of local residents 'micro-evaluation to use factor analysis to extract several tourism poverty alleviation assessment variables as main factors such as the perception of local residents' participation in utility and anticipation of tourism poverty alleviation. It can be concluded from the research on the above related literatures that, although China's rural tourism research has entered the development stage, and research on performance evaluation indicators has remained on quantitative analysis and qualitative The scoring of indicators is greatly affected by subjectivity. Based on existing assessment methods, this article tries to build a scientific, effective, qualitative and quantitative evaluation system based on this, in order to provide reference for related research. 2 Design of Tourism Poverty Alleviation Index System 2.1 Structural Standards of the Index System The first-level indicator is the dimension and direction of the assessment. It focuses on the important strategies and instructions issued by the state and relevant departments.

    "title": "Analysis of Influencing Factors on the Development of China\u2019s Sharing Cars Industry",
    "abstract": "In today's era of shared economy, sharing cars conform to the development trend of the times, so governments of various countries have high hopes for their development. The sharing car borrowed and returned immediately not only facilitates people to travel flexibly, but also reduces exhaust emissions and improves the urban environment. It has won the support of the general public and has rapidly accumulated a deep mass base in our country. This paper analyses the influencing factors on the development of the sharing cars industry from three aspects, namely, supply, demand and government, and uses the form of questionnaire to integrate the influencing factors into the questionnaire topics for detailed research. On this basis, it puts forward targeted suggestions to provide certain theoretical reference for the healthy and rapid development of the sharing cars industry. 1. Development Status of Sharing Cars in China 1.1 Related Concepts of Sharing Cars Shared car travel mode is an environment-friendly travel mode combining the Internet and cars. It originated in Germany and Switzerland and has been adopted by other European countries since then. Shared car service, in a broad sense, is the sharing of the right to use a car, which means that people can still use the travel mode of the car without the ownership of the car. In a narrow sense, it is a car rental activity in which users pay a certain deposit, take minutes or hours as the pricing unit, and use information technologies such as mobile Internet and global positioning to build a network service platform to carry out self-service vehicle reservation, vehicle return and fee settlement. 1.2 Development Status of Sharing Cars 1.2. 1. The market scale has expanded significantly. Compared with developed countries, China's sharing cars industry started relatively late, but its development is very rapid. With the innovation of the Internet, sharing cars has become one of the main representatives of the shared economy. Relevant government departments have increased their attention to the development of the sharing cars industry, and many automobile-related enterprises have continuously entered the industry. According to statistics, starting from 2017, the number of newly registered sharing car enterprises has gradually increased. As of June 2018, there are more than 400 registered sharing car enterprises in China, and the number of sharing cars put into operation has exceeded 100,000. In 2015, the size of China's sharing car market was only 52 million yuan, and by 2017, the size of China's sharing car market had increased to 1.729 billion yuan. 1.2. 2. The financing of the sharing cars industry is stable. The sharing cars industry has always been a hot area for investors. According to statistics, China's auto travel industry completed 341 financing projects in 2018, with a total financing of 187.3 billion yuan. Among them, 84 enterprises in the field of science and technology travel (online car-hailing, sharing cars, etc.) have completed financing, accounting for 28% of the total number of enterprises, with a total financing amount of 74.8 billion yuan.

The scale of users has grown steadily and the industry is on the rise. Judging from the number of users of sharing car App, its user size and industry penetration rate are still growing steadily. According to the data, from November 2017 to November 2018, the number of users in China's sharing cars industry increased steadily from 3.89 million to 9.524 million, up 144.83% year on year. On the other hand, the industry penetration rate rose steadily from 0.39% in November 2017 to 0.87% in November 2018, up 0.48 percentage points. Therefore, the sharing car industry is on the rise. 1.3 Main Factors Influencing the Development of Sharing Cars 1.3. 1. Perspective of Supply: On the one hand, the operating cost of sharing cars enterprises is relatively high, mainly including vehicle purchase fees, insurance premiums, maintenance fees, construction of related facilities, management and maintenance fees, etc. On the other hand, the income model of sharing cars enterprises is relatively single and it is difficult to make profits in the short term. If an enterprise cannot effectively control costs, improve operational efficiency and explore a reasonable profit model, it will not be able to survive in long-term competition [2]. 1.3. 2. Perspective of Demand: Consumers' perception of sharing cars will directly affect the choice of consumption behaviour. When the sharing cars industry arose, due to the limitation of traditional ideas, consumers' recognition was low and the market scale expanded slowly [3]. With the improvement of consumers' cognitive level, the number of users has also surged. Secondly, the quality of user experience is also an important factor that determines the sustainable development of the sharing cars industry. Every link from user registration to completion of lease must adhere to the principle of user-oriented design, with the aim of realizing users' multiple consumption and word-of-mouth effect. 1.3. 3. Perspective of Government: With the expansion of the scale of the sharing cars industry, the shortage of public resources such as license plates, parking spaces and charging piles has become a bottleneck restricting the rapid development of the industry [4]. As the manager of public resources, the government's relevant policies and measures directly affect the development speed of the sharing cars industry. Sharing cars is a supplement to public transportation and is conducive to alleviating urban traffic problems. In recent years, many governments have gradually increased their support for the sharing cars industry and continuously created favourable conditions for its development. 2. Empirical Analysis of Influencing Factors on the Development of Sharing Cars 2.1 Questionnaire Design As a green travel mode for sustainable development in the new era, sharing cars not only effectively slow down environmental pollution, but also meet the needs of different groups and promote the development of new energy sources. This paper designs a set of questionnaires on the development of sharing cars through consulting and drawing lessons from relevant literatures and combining the analysis of the above influencing factors. The influencing factors involved in the questionnaire mainly include users' own factors, travel characteristics, community influence, willingness to use, selection criteria, etc. Among them, the user's own factors include the user's gender and age, education level, current living city and occupation [5]. Travel characteristics are mainly the reasons and scenes for consumers to use sharing cars. Community influence refers to the channels through which users know how to share cars; Willingness to use refers to whether users are willing to use sharing cars and support the development of sharing cars. Selection criteria refer to which aspects users will choose according to the model, brand, price, etc. of the sharing car. Finally, we also designed a topic about measures to solve some obvious problems in the current sharing car market, Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 126",

    "title": "The Reform of Yoga Teaching in Colleges and Universities under the New Situation of \"Fitness Yoga\"",
    "abstract": "This article mainly uses the literature method, Firstly; it expounds the constraints that affect the development of \"fitness yoga\" teaching in Chinese colleges and universities. Then combined with the new situation of the current domestic \"fitness yoga\" promotion, research on the current situation of yoga teaching environment, teachers and teaching mode in colleges and universities, put forward the strategy of fitness yoga development and promotion in colleges and universities:(1) College yoga teachers should strengthen their study, grasp the new situation of domestic fitness yoga development, and shoulder the responsibility of spreading and promoting fitness yoga;(2) Yoga teaching in colleges and universities should incorporate the \"Standard Standards for 2018 Fitness Yoga Competition\" and \"General Yoga Yoga Ranks, Double Regulations and Four-person Collective Regulations\" into the practical teaching process;(3) Schools with physical education departments in colleges and universities may consider adding fitness yoga courses when conditions are ripe. Yoga, originated in India, was officially introduced to China in the 1980s.At present, with the vigorous development of national fitness and the significant improvement of public health awareness, more and more people choose yoga to exercise, and yoga has become a fashionable fitness exercise. However, after nearly 30 years of development, at present, China's yoga market is still chaotic, there are many \"chaos\", which seriously affects the normal order of the yoga industry, has become an unavoidable topic, and needs to be resolved. In order to guide the healthy development of the domestic yoga industry, the National Sports General Administration's Social Sports Guidance Center established the National Yoga Promotion Committee in early 2016 and officially launched the Chinese localized yoga promotion model, Fitness Yoga. In the same year, the China University Sports Association responded to the promotion of national sports, and added a fitness yoga program competition in the Chinese College Health Vigor Competition. Although the fitness yoga program has been vigorously promoted and developed in recent years, the promotion and development of fitness yoga in Chinese universities is still very slow, especially as a college sports option class, which does not highlight the advantages of fitness yoga courses. How can we make fitness yoga rooted in colleges and universities and become the highlight of college sports elective courses? In addition to the promotion of fitness yoga by the State Sports General Administration, the training of yoga coaches and referees of the China University Sports Association, we also need to the current situation of yoga teaching environment, teachers and teaching mode is studied. 1 Factors affecting the development of fitness yoga teaching in colleges and universities 1.1 Lack of fitness yoga teachers The teaching quality of fitness yoga in colleges and universities has a great relationship with the professional ability and teaching level of yoga teachers. However, at present, the yoga teachers in colleges and universities in China are basically developed from other self-study such as aerobics, gymnastics, martial arts and even ball games, and track and field teachers. There are very few teachers who have graduated from yoga specialties, and there are only special yoga graduates in recent years. According to the survey, Yunnan University for Nationalities opened a yoga major 2020 International Conference on Educational Training and Educational Phenomena (ICETEP2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000992 ISBN: 978-1-80052-005-9 -460earlier. In 2015, the China-India Yoga Academy was established with non-academic education and academic qualifications. In addition, Shenyang Sports Institute also opened yoga major earlier, Tianjin Sports Institute. Xi'an Institute of Physical Education and other sports majors have also set up yoga compulsory courses, but they have only been opened in the past one or two years. The time is not long, and the training of teaching personnel is still at the stage of development. Therefore, most yoga teachers in colleges and universities are not Professional origin. In addition, after investigation, most of the current yoga teachers' professional knowledge is only obtained through self-study and online video. Only a small part of the yoga teachers' professional knowledge is obtained through the Yoga Instructor Training Center. The current situation of college yoga teachers has seriously affected the quality of yoga teaching, which will hinder the development of the project in colleges and universities. 1.2 Fitness yoga textbooks lack uniform standards As fitness yoga is still in its infancy, as an emerging physical education curriculum is introduced into colleges and universities, the current education department of the university does not have unified management and professional guidance for the teaching of fitness yoga, resulting in imperfect yoga course system. The positioning and selection of teaching content is very important in the teaching process. There are investigations and studies, and the selection and positioning of teaching content is unreasonable, which will affect the development of fitness yoga classes in colleges and universities. At present, there is no unified outline and unified tutorial for college yoga teaching. The syllabus and plan of each university are self-made and self-made. The selection of teaching content is basically the teaching of the teachers according to their professional characteristics and practice factions. Lack of rationality, science and relevance. In addition, colleges with yoga teams, whether they are participating in the Open Games hosted by the State Sports General Administration, club leagues, or the Chinese University Students Sports Association sponsored the Chinese University Students Health and Vitality Competition fitness yoga program, the reference books are only the National Sports General Administration social sports guidance. The \"Standards for the Position of the 2018 Fitness Yoga Competition\" formulated by the Center and the \"Sports Association of the General Association of Yoga, the Formulation of the Two-person Formula and the Four-person Collective Regulations for the Formula\". These two standard standards are only stipulated and classified, and are not a relatively complete, scientific, and targeted textbook suitable for college yoga teaching or training. 1.3 Fitness yoga teaching, representative team training venue is not met Fitness yoga is different from traditional sports. The requirements for teaching and team training venues are relatively high, requiring a quiet, clean and comfortable environment. However, according to the survey, many colleges and universities do not have specialized yoga teaching and team training venues. Some of them may have an indoor venue, but they also need to be used together with other art courses, such as aerobics, sports dance, la la Exercise and other projects share a room. In addition, some colleges and universities do not even have yoga teaching and team training venues. The course is arranged on the playground, the playground is noisy, playing football, playing basketball, running, and so on. If you encounter rain or snow or windy weather, you will have to suspend classes or training, so the yoga course will not achieve the desired teaching effect, and the level of the yoga team will be affected. 2. Fitness yoga reform strategies in colleges and universities 2.1 Building a strong faculty Fitness yoga courses If you want to carry out the characteristics of the course in colleges and universities, the yoga teachers' own professional skills and teaching level play a key role.In order to improve the fitness yoga technical staff management system, the National Sports General Administration's Social Sports Guidance Center actively promotes the \u201cStandard for Fitness Yoga",

    "title": "Application of Developmental Teacher Evaluation System in Private Colleges and Universities",
    "abstract": "In terms of teachers, they are the core competitiveness of colleges and universities. Besides, the teams of young teachers in private colleges and universities are growing with the rapid development of private education. As a result, it has become an important task for private colleges and universities to build a development evaluation system for teachers. Through the analysis of the problems existing in the current teacher evaluation system of private colleges and universities in this paper, it puts forward the strategies of building a developmental teacher evaluation system in private colleges and universities, so as to promote the improvement of teachers' level and their own development, realize the sustainability of teachers' career, as well as further promote the overall quality and level of teachers in private colleges and universities. 1. Research Background What should be pointed out is that the quality and level of teachers have an impact on the process of education development, which also determine the quality of talents delivered to the society. Since teachers are the core competitiveness of colleges and universities, the exertion of teachers' efficiency has a great impact on the further development of private colleges and universities. Besides, the young teachers of private colleges and universities are also growing with the rapid development of private education. In view of it, the construction of a developmental teacher evaluation system has become an important task of private colleges and universities. When it comes to the development evaluation system, it began in the UK in the 1990s, which was first formally launched in primary and secondary schools. As for this evaluation method, it is the sublation of reward and punishment evaluation, and the basic framework system of developmental teacher evaluation based on the reasonable part of the original evaluation. In 1998, Professor Wang Binhua of East China Teachers' University wrote a book called Developmental Teacher Evaluation System, who pointed out that \"developmental evaluation is a new and future oriented teacher evaluation system\"1. Thus, it has been widely recognized by domestic scholars, and the developmental evaluation system is introduced into the country. At the same time, it is also clearly proposed to establish an evaluation system to promote the continuous improvement of teachers in the Outline of Basic Education Reform (Trial) issued by the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China. The introduction of this outline makes more and more people gradually accept the idea of developing teacher evaluation. Although the evaluation of developmental teachers started late in our country, this evaluation system has been fully affirmed with the gradual recognition of different levels of scholars. In addition, it has also been recognized that this evaluation method can better stimulate the intrinsic motivation of teachers, which can help to overcome the disadvantages of the current traditional evaluation system. Since the development evaluation of teachers has been introduced into China for more than ten years, it can be seen that the domestic scholars strongly advocate the development evaluation of teachers. However, most of the discussion is limited to the theoretical research, and there are few researches that can put forward an effective development evaluation system, especially for the research and application of the construction of the development evaluation system of teachers in private colleges and universities. 2020 International Conference on Social and Human Sciences (ICSHS2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000125 ISBN: 978-1-80052-000-4 698 2. Problems Existing in the Evaluation System of Private Colleges and Universities Teachers as a typical knowledge-based employee inevitably meet some special characteristics in management, such as the complexity of the work process, the difficulty in measuring the results of work, personalized labor and so on. Thus, it is necessary to think about how to improve the efficiency of teachers and give full play to their ability. And there are still many deficiencies in the management of private colleges and universities, which mainly shows the following disadvantages: 2.1. It pays more attention to rewards and punishments than to development in the aspect of performance evaluation goal setting For most of the private colleges and universities, they still use the traditional reward and punishment evaluation system, whose understanding of the development evaluation is not deep enough. In terms of rewards and punishments performance evaluation, it focuses on the teaching results or teaching achievements of teachers, which emphasizes the evaluation of teachers' morality, ability, diligence and performance. Besides, the evaluation results are directly related to the promotion, honor and bonus of teachers. It has no positive effect on the future development of teachers and schools though it plays the role of rewarding the excellent and punishing the poor, promoting the enthusiasm of teachers' work. At present, there are few private colleges and universities to improve the ability of teachers for the purpose of performance evaluation. 2.2. It pays more attention to quantity than quality in terms of performance evaluation index design As for the application of performance evaluation in private colleges and universities, it is not ideal. In the design of indexes, it pays much attention to results instead of process, which is mainly to evaluate teachers' teaching quality by quantifying teachers' performance evaluation results. As far as the nature of teachers' work is concerned, the quality of teaching cannot be judged only by quantitative results. 2.3. It emphasizes results instead of feedback in the implementation of performance evaluation At present, it is found that many private colleges and universities mainly use teaching inspection and year-end evaluation during teaching. In the process of teaching inspection, it scores and evaluates teaching, which does not give evaluation feedback to the examinee, so is the year-end evaluation, which often becomes the final link of evaluation by publicizing evaluation results,instead of carrying out evaluation feedback. 2.4. It attaches importance to material incentives rather than motivation mechanisms in terms of the application of performance evaluation results Moreover, it can be seen that many private colleges and universities pay more attention to material incentive than motivation mechanism in performance evaluation results. In addition, the performance evaluation results of teachers are more applied to salary, so teachers' salaries, bonuses and other incentives are increased or punitively reduced according to the evaluation results. At the same time, few private colleges and universities apply the results of teachers' performance evaluation to training, and find gaps through the results to carry out targeted training for the purpose of improving teachers' ability. 3. The Effective Strategy for the Construction of the Developmental Evaluation System of Private Colleges and Universities 3.1. Strengthen the cognition of developmental evaluation and set the target of teacher performance evaluation correctly In terms of developmental teacher performance evaluation, it is a kind of formative teacher evaluation, which aims to promote the individual development of teachers, takes the goal as the",

    "title": "Study on the Integration of Tourist Residential Accommodation Design and Regional Cultural and Creative Industries in Northeast China",
    "abstract": "According to statistics, in 2018, the total number of domestic residential hotels in mainland China is 42,658, the majority of the northeast host family status quo only in the \"farm house\" and \"Yujiale.\" Through the analysis of the development of residential accommodation at home and abroad, this paper understands the history and current situation of the development of the three national homes of Britain, the United States and Japan. Under the influence of Japan, Taiwan first develops the rural homestead industry, and then gradually spread to the mainland of China. Through combing and analyzing it, it is believed that the development of host families should be based on tourism resources. Secondly, combine natural resources, pay attention to regional characteristics, and then make regional cultural resources as the main line. Finally, according to the conclusion of the study, apply it to the rural residential design in Northeast China. Through field investigation, survey and visit, apply the theoretical research to the actual operation to construct the architectural design of rural housing with the local characteristics of Northeast China. 1. Overview of the Cultural Situation in the Northeast 1.1 The Emergence of Regional Culture in the Northeast Northeast china includes Heilongjiang Province, Jilin Province, Liaoning Province and Eastern Inner Mongolia. This paper mainly studies the regional culture of Northeast China. The Northeast region has a unique custom. People in the Northeast are simple, forthright and humorous. In the past, the Northeast region is prevalent with the ten monsters: shoemakers poking at doors, raising children hanging, window papering, large vats and small vats of pickles, wearing leather clothes, facing the window, big girls holding cigarette bags, chimneys outside the gable wall. 1.2 The Influence of Foreign Culture In 1910, the Northeast sent the first 20 international students to Japan. In the early years of the Republic of China, the Northeast sent more than 60 international students to Japan, Europe, the United States and Russia to study. Since then, this number has increased year by year. By sending international students to learn advanced Western culture knowledge, they can directly understand the customs and national cultures of all countries in the world.[1] Through education, they can also bring foreign advanced politics, thought, culture, education, art and so on back to China. As a result of the long-term study experience, many students' living habits have not changed in a short period of time. To a certain extent, it drives and affects the people around. Since then, the northeast regional culture is basically developing in the direction of civilization and progress. In 1987, Russia and Japan built a number of Russian and Western-style railway stations, office buildings, churches, factories, hospitals, schools and other commercial and civil buildings in the Northeast. A number of Western-style buildings of different sizes have appeared in the Northeast.[2] Harbin's typical architectural style is Gothic, Byzantine, neoclassical, Baroque and eclectic. Italian style, Art Nouveau sports style, Typical Santa Sophia Cathedral Byzantine style, Medill Hotel Art Nouveau sports style, St. Iver Church Russian style, Middle East Railway Bureau Art Nouveau sports style ... These buildings have made a deep impression on Harbin. Since then, Heilongjiang has also become the world's cultural exchange gathering place. The culture, technology, art, religion 2020 International Conference on Social and Human Sciences (ICSHS2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000016 ISBN: 978-1-80052-000-4 82 and way of life brought by foreigners have affected the people of the Northeast to some extent. 1.3 Unique Northeast Regional Culture In agricultural production, there are many tools for agricultural production, such as the appearance of cattle, saddles and horn cones, walking sticks and so on. Cattle saddles, saddles and horn cones are used to secure cattle, horses and other livestock for the cultivation and harvesting of crops. In addition, stone mills, blowers and corn perforators are also used for grain harvesting and processing.[3] The blower is a traditional agricultural production tool that embodies the wisdom of farmers in Northeast China, and is an indispensable part of the culture of northeast agricultural region. 2. The Feasibility Analysis of the Integration of Tourist Residential Accommodation Design and Regional Cultural and Creative Industries in Northeast China 2.1 Political and Economic Conditions Provide Implementation Guarantees for Integration The economic base is the material condition to ensure the application of regional factors in the design of residential space. To some extent, the relationship between economy and design is not directly produced. After the reform and opening up, the national economy are rapidly developing, the living standards of urban residents are remarkable improving, people's spiritual needs for living and residential space are also gradually increasing, thus promoting the renewal of design concepts.[4] Northeast has a long history, has a magnificent natural scenery, and has a residential location depends on the mountains and water. Applying the unique regional elements contained in soil and water to the design of living space can bring a unique human color to the design of living space. Only the opening of the political environment and the support of economic conditions can guarantee the application of the elements of the Northeast region in the design of living space, or the transformation of the space of idle living space and the construction of local living space. 2.2 Cultural Heritage and Protection Provide Design Conditions for Integration The villa is made up of idle houses and beautiful scenery. Therefore, the design of homestead space is very dependent on the residential environment and regional culture. The use of the elements of the Northeast region in the living space can not only optimize the living environment and enhance the cultural atmosphere, but also promote, protect and inherit the traditional regional culture of northeast China. In recent years, under the protection of national rural tourism policy, local cultural construction, cultural identity and local excellent culture, designers have shifted from a bustling urban style to simple and laid-back design.[5] The characteristics of living space make it the carrier of regional elements. The design of the homestead space is very dependent on the residential environment and regional culture.[6] The use of the elements of the Northeast region in the living space can not only optimize the living environment and enhance the cultural atmosphere, but also promote, protect and inherit the traditional regional culture of northeast China. In recent years, under the protection of national rural tourism policy, local cultural construction, cultural identity and local excellent culture, designers have shifted from a bustling urban style to simple and laid-back design.[7] 2.3 The Change of Tourism Concept Provides the Feasibility of Integration Due to the increase in economic income, people's demand for tourist accommodation is no longer to provide simple accommodation, but to actively make demands on local culture, local customs, natural scenery and other fields. Change has led to a variety of explorations and innovative designs of tourist accommodation spaces. Among them, the application of regional elements, decorative technology and local materials are the multidisciplinary application of regional elements, which makes the space unique in regional style and brings more appropriate experience to tourists. In this way, family vacations will become a accommodation option for more and more tourists. It is believed that with the change of people's concept of tourism, the application of regional elements in",

    "title": "The Disputes over the South China Sea in the Background of the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d Initiative versus the Indo-Pacific Strategy\u2014From Chinese Perspective",
    "abstract": "Whether for the China\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201dinitiative or the US\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy, the situation in the South China Sea region is a key factor in the smooth progress of each other. All Chinese actions which consistent with international law are not the source of disputes in the South China Sea region. Since the\u201cBelt and Road\u201dinitiative, China and other claiming countries in the South China Sea region are actively working together to control the deterioration of the situation and have achieved positive results. At present, it is generally stabilizing.Under the implementation of the Indo-Pacific strategy, the South China Sea dispute has risen from a regional issue to a global issue,and its essence is no longer in the category of regional disputes between China and other claiming countries, but evolve to the strategic game among the big powers under realistic thinking due to insufficient strategic mutual trust and misjudgement of strategic intention. Based on this, China should first acknowledge the actual interests of the America in the Asia-Pacific related regions,continue to consolidate and promote the goog relationship between China and the United States;Secondly, it should be based on the \u201cdual regulations\u201d to promote negotiations between the disputed parties involved;Finally, China needs to actively guide international public opinion through various media to shape its positive international image in the South China Sea region affairs. The South China Sea gets its name from its geographical waters.It is located in the southern waters of the continental margin of mainland China and in the westward waters of the Pacific Ocean.Since the 1970s, multi-party disputes have formed around the sovereignty of the Island Reef and the jurisdiction involved of some sea areas,which includes:China,Vietnam,Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Taiwan.Besides, Intervention by extraterritorial forces has made disputes in this region one of the most complex disputes over island sovereignty and maritime jurisdiction in the world. In the current, China\u2019s sovereign action on the islands of the South China Sea receives high attention from Indo-Pacific Strategy.The situation in the South China Sea is a key variable for the smooth progress of the US\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy and China\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative. 1. The Status Quo under the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d Initiative: from Tension to Easing In the early days of the\u201cBelt and Road\u201dinitiative,related countries involved in the disputes intensified their activities in the area of dispute. In particular, Vietnam and the Philippines are more active. In 2012, Vietnam passed the National Ocean Law on sovereignty over Xisha and Nansha.In 2020 International Conference on Social and Human Sciences (ICSHS2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000107 ISBN: 978-1-80052-000-4 596 2013,Vietnam established the Fisheries Administration to enhance the marine monitoring capabilities In 2014,the 981 drilling platform incident broke out. The China-Philippine Huangyan Island incident broke out in 2012.The Philippines initiated international arbitration procedures in 2013,and strengthened control over Renai Reef in 2014.In addition, during this period, despite apparent differences of opinion among ASEAN member states, they were still struggling to find a coordinated legal basis. In 2012, ASEAN issued the \u201cSix Principles\u201d,which explicitly stated that \u201cbased on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international laws settle disputes peacefully\u201d, which to some extent reflects the \u201cASEANization\u201d trend of the South China Sea issue. The \u201cBelt and Road\u201d Initiative is not a dedicated solution to the South China Sea issue, but the countries along the South China Sea are priority areas for the \u201c21st Century Maritime Silk Road\u201d. Since the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d Initiative in 2013, China has made a series of adjustments to Policy in the region. The main performance is embodied into the following three aspects. The first is the \u201ctwo-track approach\u201d. Specific disputes over the South China Sea are settled by the parties directly through bilateral negotiations on the basis of respect for historical facts and international law. At the same time, peace and stability are jointly maintained by China and ASEAN. This is highly consistent with the spirit of multilateral cooperative governance inherent in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties(DOC).This marks a change in the way China handles its problems. China has shifted from the idea of negotiating only between disputed states to recognizing limited multilateral discussions. This is fundamentally different from the previous attitude of total rejection. The second is to strengthen the consensus on the \u201cdual-track principle\u201d through high-level exchanges. In October 2013,Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Indonesia and Malaysia respectively. He stated that China is willing to strengthen many maritime development cooperation with ASEAN countries, make good use of the China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Fund, jointly develop a good maritime partnership, and work together 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Construction. In the same year, Li Keqiang visited Brune, signed a Memorandum of Understanding on China-Brunei Offshore Cooperation and an agreement on the establishment of a joint venture company in the field of oilfield services. The two sides issued a joint statement on this. When Xi Jinping visited Vietnam and Singapore in 2015,the two sides reached a consensus on \u201cproperly handling and managing maritime differences and focusing on advancing maritime cooperation\u201d. When the Philippine President Duterre visited China in 2016, China and the Philippines reaffirmed the \u201cdual-track principle\u201d to resolve the differences and signed the \u201cJoint Statement of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Republic of the Philippines\u201d. The two sides stated that \u201c they will continue to settle differences and disputes through negotiations, comprehensively implement the \u2018Declaration of Conduct\u2019 (DOC), strive for an early consensus on \u2018Code of Conduct\u2019 (COC), maintain restraint, and maintain stability in the South China Sea\u201d. From 2017 to 2018, the three rounds of bilateral consultation mechanisms between China and the Philippines were launched. In November 2018, Xi Jinping paid a state visit to the Philippines, and the two countries signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in Oil and Gas Development. The two countries have made significant breakthroughs in practical cooperation. Since the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative, China has taken a \u201cdual-track approach\u201d as a guide, and is actively working to control the deterioration of the situation with other claimants in the region, and has achieved positive results. At present, it is generally stabilizing. In addition, China and ASEAN have achieved remarkable results in regional interaction. In 2016, China and the ASEAN countries adopted the Joint Statement on the Comprehensive and Effective Implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct. China and",

The country fair, as an ancient trading model, performing a variety of bright light in this small town. In this paper, theThe Pottery Workshop is taken as an example to discussed the development and innovation of the individualized ceramics in JingDezhen. The history of the ceramic production of Jingdezhen can be retrospected to 1700 years ago. In the process of development, countless ceramic types, pictures, skills, classics and talents were emerged, it become the epitome of Chinese ceramics even of the world ceramics, which has accumulated extensive and profound, rich and colorful ceramic culture and historical resources. As a old town who are famous for ceramics, Jingdezhen has porcelain industry with a sense of history, relying on unique ceramic resources to build a branded ancient ceramic capital. Under the background of new era, basing on the traditional industrial model of resource consumption, Jingdezhen gradually carries out industrial transformation and carries out the excavation and innovation of cultural industry vigorously. Jingdezhen, as an ancient town for thousands of years, is famous for its ceramics. How to combine the artistry with the development of the society and lining with the aesthetic trend of the masses is the key to the successful transformation for Jingdezhen. 1. The Present Situation of the Development of The Pottery Workshop Up to now, the ceramic industry of the world has changed several times, and the rise of creative industry has also given new inspiration to this ancient town. How to continue to inherit the Millennium kiln fire? How to get a seat for ceramic making in the new era? This is a question that every craftsman needs to think about. In such an ancient town, which has a new trend of thought and a new vitality, while retaining a sense of history for a thousand years, creative ceramic bazaar is undoubtedly the most novel and informative existence. The Pottery Workshop is located in Jingdezhen Zhushan District, Xinchang East Road Sculpture porcelain Factory, it was originally a ceramic factory,founded in the 1950s, but now it refers to the surrounding sculpture porcelain factory.

Room, board and transportation around The Pottery Workshop has coffee shops, restaurants, a number of ceramic workshops, which can provide tourists, and stall owners with a more perfect work or leisure area, high-quality ceramic studios make the fair more literary. Restaurants and coffee shops solve the problem of eating and rest, entering the coffee shop on the way to the bazaar and sit down for a while to feel the comfortable and leisurely time in the bazaar. The Pottery Workshop Bazaar is located in a area that can link with all directions, it will take 15 minutes to drive from the prosperous urban area to there, and it is very convenient for foreign tourists to travel here. Sculpture porcelain factory close to the school around, the transportation is convenient, the catering and accommodation conditions are perfect. It is close to these popular attractions, such as Jingdezhen Ceramic Museum, Sanbao International Pottery Village, Fuliang Ancient County Ya and Taoxichuan Creative District, self-driving trips or public transport can be easily reached. 1.2. Talent advantage The Pottery Workshop is adjacent to the old campus of Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute and it will take only 15 minutes' to drive to the new campus. Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute is the only university named for ceramics in China, which has a long history. It has developed into an important base for the exchange of ceramic culture and art, ceramic personnel training and scientific and technological innovation in the whole country and even in the world. It will transport a large number of professionals for the domestic and foreign ceramic market to every year. In the bazaar, there are many vendors from Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute. They have studied systematically in the school and have good professional qualities. At the same time, they have been influenced by the art atmosphere of Jingdezhen. The ceramic work has a unique advantage, which is also a major advantage of The Pottery Workshop to maintain its exuberant original vitality. 1.3. Competitive pressure Compared with other creative ceramic bases in Jingdezhen, The Pottery Workshop has always adhered to the principle of originality first, providing a pure land for these young and talented artists to create, but in recent years, the external environment has been constantly changed, how to seek change in stability and how to adhere to the original while integrating a better business model are problems that The Pottery Workshop bazaar needs to face the in the future. In recent years, creative industry has been a relatively mature emerging industry, which is supported by a number of policies of government, creative ceramic industry is undoubtedly a very dazzling star in the creative industry, which has great development potential. Only seeking policy support can there be enough power to make a number of attempts and changes. 2. The Innovation and Development Thought of Individualized Creative Ceramics 2.1. Maintenance and development of original system in the market To respect the originality is to respect the individual's work and the innovation spirit of the enterprise. Only by continuously improving the policy of protecting intellectual property rights, can the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises and individuals be guaranteed, and the phenomenon of copying cultural and creative industries can be suppressed effectively. Ceramic creative industry is different from other physical industries. Its core value is creative labor and achievement of ceramics. However, due to the restriction of traditional manual workshop concept, the application of intellectual property rights and system regulation are not up to the speed of the infringement of creative industry. Compared with other creative ceramics markets in Jingdezhen, The Pottery Workshop is characterized by its market access mechanism. Regarding originality as the first requirement, not only can this characteristic provides a benign promotion channel for the vendors in the bazaar, but also makes the works in the bazaar have a high quality and attracts consumers from all over the country to buy the ceramic works. It should be noted that when doing a good job of original originality protection, we should also improve the production technology, equipment type",

    "title": "Cost-benefit Analysis of Dairy Cattle Breeding under Circular Agriculture Mode-- take the Sunshine Dairy Farm in DaWang Town, Guangrao County, Shandong Province as an Example",
    "abstract": "China's agricultural development is currently in the critical stage of transformation and upgrading. It is an inevitable requirement for China's agricultural development to build an ecological agricultural circular economy. It is an important challenge in the process of China's agricultural development to build a circular economic system of ecological agriculture and improve the income and living standards of farmers. It is an important embodiment of the concept of sustainable development in the practice of agricultural production, and it has become a hot issue at home and abroad. In recent years, Yangguang dairy farm in Dawang Town, Guangrao County, Shandong Province has made full use of the concept of ecological agricultural circular economy to breed cows and gained some experience in the construction of ecological agriculture. Based on the analysis of the basic connotation of circular economy, this paper takes Yangguang dairy farm in Dawang Town, Guangrao County, Shandong Province as an example to analyze the benefits of each cycle. Circular agriculture is compared with the traditional agricultural development put forward a new kind of development model, applying the idea of sustainable development and circular economy theory and ecological engineering methods, combined with ecology, ecological economics, ecological technology principle and its basic rule, in the protection of agricultural ecological environment and make full use of high and new technology, on the basis of adjustment and optimization of agricultural ecological system internal structure and industrial structure, improve agricultural ecosystem multistage circulation of matter and energy use, strictly control the external input and agricultural waste of harmful substances, maximize reduce environmental pollution. Relying on cow breeding and high-quality forage grass planting, the sunshine dairy farm of dawang town, guangrao county, shandong province, has built a circular pattern of \"forage grass plant-dairy cow culture-waste disposal returning organic fertilizer to the field\" as the main line. This model fully draws on the mature breeding management experience and technological innovation achievements of the dairy industry developed countries, and establishes a sustainable modern dairy industry model with higher production efficiency and better product quality. In this mode, it is beneficial to realize the recycling of resources and establish the green ecological dairy industry. Guangrao county of shandong province town of king sun dairy actively the construction of modern agricultural industrial park, formed to dairy industry as the leading factor, the modern farming base, characteristics of dairy processing for a \"be satisfactory cycle\", the whole chain, the whole industry circular economy development pattern, and raising combination of advancing, resource conservation, energy conservation and emissions reduction, standardization certification, basic to achieve the goal of \"zero emissions\". The realization of the goal of \"zero emission\" is to rely on dairy cattle breeding and high-quality forage grass planting to construct the cycle mode of \"forage grass planting dairy cattle breeding waste disposal returning organic fertilizer to the field\" as the main line, so as to form the typical model of \"cattle, marsh and forage grass\" ecological cycle agriculture that can be copied and popularized. Sunshine dairy farms, for example, the existing 600 cows, the year of 07000 tons of waste, urine, and flushing water, 14000 tons of silage planting base 1000 mu, has built the biogas project 1, an annual output of 9777 tons, 20000 tons of biogas slurry renewal, park farming produce 2020 International Conference on Social and Human Sciences (ICSHS2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000113 ISBN: 978-1-80052-000-4 631 waste, renewal biogas slurry to achieve full capacity utilization, waste of zero emission in the area of the implementation at the same time, provide quality fertilizer for forage grass planting, promote forage plant capacity and comprehensive benefits. In the process of breeding also promote water and fertilizer and medicine. Around \"one of two minus three basic\" overall objectives, implement the planting of agricultural water price reform, breeding field acting on agricultural irrigation water use groundwater \"super premium\" encouragement \"section\" water price reform mode, set up 186 m after/mu water power, on the basis of the current water price increase after more than 0.1 yuan/m after, higher than that of water right amount (186 m3 / mu) under irrigation quota (232 m after/mu) for water saving rewards, in the super premium, on the basis of the grain per 1 m after water saving water user (irrigation water quota minus the actual water consumption), Reward at 0.2 yuan/m; Non-grain water users will be rewarded at 0.1 yuan/m for every 1 m of water saved (irrigation water quota minus actual water consumption). Through the market mechanism, drip irrigation, spray irrigation technology to achieve the total amount of water control objectives. Combination through the establishment of \"grass planting dairy waste returning organic fertilizer\" mode of circulation, promote TongFang rule and prevention and control, green sharply reduced the applying chemical fertilizer and pesticide content, now more than 50% of the land to complete organic fertilizer instead of chemical fertilizer, other land by soil testing and fertilizer, cucumber in the chemical fertilizer, pesticide consumption was reduced by 70%. On energy conservation and emission reduction. Farms have gradually established a sound sewage treatment system and clean energy supply system. The sewage treatment system, reclaimed water reuse system, reverse osmosis and other aspects of the effluent after treatment, as reclaimed water for flushing toilets, greening irrigation, boiler ash flushing and water system backwashing, can save about 13,000 tons of water annually, reduce the sewage discharge of 12,000 tons. Above is the circular agriculture model run by sunshine dairy farm, in which many resources are fully utilized and some costs are saved. Take sunshine dairy farm as an example. In the recycling mode, the average annual cost per cow is as follows: 1.Feed cost: RMB 7,166, including RMB 3,230 for fine feed and RMB 936 for green coarse feed. 2.Hydropower, fuel and power cost: RMB 155.16 in total. 3.The medical and epidemic prevention fee is 160 yuan. 4.The total cost of tools and materials is RMB 415.96, including RMB 68.37 for tools and RMB 47.59 for repair and maintenance 5.The insurance premium is 500 yuan, the management fee is 102.08 yuan, and the sales fee is 68.8 yuan. Among them insurance premium 500 yuan government subsidy 400 yuan. 6.The land costs 7.5 yuan. 7.Labor costs: 2,418.6, which is equivalent to 21.03 days of employment, at 115 yuan per day. The above is the cost, and the following is the annual average income per cow: 1.Output value of main products: RMB 24,152.4, mainly income from fresh milk sales. 2.Output value of by-product: RMB 3,382.99, including income from calves, fertilizer and cattle elimination. Take the sunshine farm with 600 cattle as an example, according to the calculation of 365 days a year, the average daily production of fresh milk is about 7800 jin, the total annual output of fresh milk is about 1,424 tons. Each cow can produce milk for about 305 days under normal conditions, and the dry milk period is about 60 days. The average service life of a cow from birth to elimination is about 5 years. It can produce 2 to 3 calves, of which male calves and female calves account for about 45% and 55% respectively. Male calves sell for about 2000 yuan, while female calves sell for about 2500 yuan. A cow can only sell meat when eliminated, the net weight of meat is about 300 jin. From the above data, the annual average revenue per cow = output value RMB 27,535.39 -total production cost RMB 13,673.2 = RMB 13,862, calculated according to the main product per 50 kg, revenue = total cost RMB 2774.5 -production cost RMB 152.55 = net profit RMB 124.90. The profit of dairy industry is closely related to the milk yield of dairy cow, so the profit of breeding industry depends on the milk yield. The following is the change analysis of milk yield:",

    "title": "Research on the Reform of Practice Teaching Mode of Art Design Major in Higher Private College",
    "abstract": "From the perspective of higher private colleges, research on the employment and innovation ability of students has become the focus and difficulty under the new situation. Higher private colleges want to be invincible in the competition of \u201cspringing up\u201d, so they must form their own professional characteristics, combine theory and practice, and form an effective connection between practical teaching and employment. On the basis of the integration of \u201cindustry, academics and research\u201d, a teaching innovation mode of \u201cteaching, research, and practice\u201d is constructed to coordinate the development and employment competitiveness of graduates. Employment-oriented art design major strengthens the college-enterprise cooperation, breaks the bottleneck of innovation and art design talent training mode, and meets the needs of colleges and society to achieve a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation. 1. The proposal of the question To a certain extent, higher private colleges are an important part of China\u2019s higher education, and the main product of the trend of popularization. In general, they are the continuation of the Alma Mater talent training mode rarely with their own characteristics due to the uniqueness of higher private colleges. In addition, compared with other colleges, higher private colleges have relatively low basic scores of students and weak faculty. With the improvement of market changes, the demand for market design talents has also risen to an important level. It is needed to strengthen the practicality on the solid theoretical basis. Many higher private colleges lack training environment and ignore the practicality. The disconnection of social practice teaching has affected the development of private art design[1]. Therefore, in order to meet the needs of market in essence, higher private colleges need to take employment as the goal, organically combine theory with practice, expand the proportion of practical teaching, reduce the time for students to adapt to employment, and lay a good foundation for students\u2019 sustainable development in the future. 2. The practical teaching status of art design major in higher private colleges Taking XX province as an example, the characteristic of art design major in higher private colleges is not obvious. The art design major studied by students is out of line with the development of society. With the trend of national policy, the tertiary industry has become a hot specialty. It can be found from relevant data survey that in 2018, 444 were higher private colleges among 2,246 colleges in China. More than 80% colleges have art design majors [2]. In the face of strong competitiveness, higher private colleges need to recognize their own shortcomings, improve equipment, and add practical teaching. In addition, there are the following prominent contradictions. First, there is a disconnection between the theoretical and practical teaching of art design in higher private colleges. That is to say, the practice design still is an armchair strategist. The lack of a certain incentive system can not mobilize the enthusiasm of students. Second, the teaching system of the practice of art design in higher private colleges has not been strengthened. The emphasis on \u201ctheory\u201d over \u201cpractice\u201d has affected the cultivation of students\u2019 practical ability[3]. Especially in the context of new media, the extension of diversified contents is more necessary to stand and keep pace with the times. Third, when the art design major of higher private colleges is in practice teaching, it can not well meet the vocational needs, and lack in-depth college-enterprise cooperation. Many higher private colleges have a short time to run, and many basic experimental measures Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research, volume 412 International Conference on Modern Educational Technology and Innovation and Entrepreneurship (ICMETIE 2020) Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

If teaching only stays at the theoretical level, then practical teaching will become superficial. Fourth, for students majoring in art in higher private colleges, there is a lack of double-qualified teachers. Many teachers\u2019 professional achievements pass the exam without the practical experience of enterprises. For a long time, they still cannot integrate the knowledge structure of students\u2019 practice and stimulate students\u2019 innovative thinking. Fifth, the practical teaching of art design and the integration of regional culture in XX region are not enough. For XX, the cultural \u201ccraftsman spirit\u201d is more advocated. Many colleges are closed to the outside world, unable to meet the needs of the market and combine the development of cultural industry in XX region with the needs of modern art design, so as to improve their professional ability to serve the people. Sixth, the art design major of higher private colleges ignores the shaping of comprehensive professional quality. From the current situation, higher private colleges in XX region have achieved certain achievements in the process of transformation, but the expansion of enrollment once hindered the development of professional characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the ability of career combination, establish a design studio and a public welfare factory on campus, set up an art research and development center, and finally realize the teaching mode of industry-university-research integration[4]. From the current situation, higher private colleges guide students to participate in artistic creation or practice through practical teaching, further extend students\u2019 creative development and improve practical results. Besides, on the basis of the integration of production, teaching and research, overall planning is needed to complete practical training, practice, operation, experiment and others. It is necessary to strengthen the integration of simulation projects, design competition and other aspects to form the docking of practical teaching and professional education mode. 3. Measures to Reform the Practice Teaching Mode of Art Design Major in Higher Private Colleges 3.1 Taking employment as the guidance to strengthen the classroom practice teaching It can be found that the needs of the post need to strengthen practical teaching under the guidance of scientific theory. First of all, it is necessary to increase the cross-integration of cultural industry resources in art design teaching, meet the needs of cultural industry and promote the development and inheritance of cultural industry through in-depth excavation. For example, the art design major in higher private colleges can be combined with folk art to improve practicality. Local features such as shadow play, new year pictures and paper cutting are integrated into practical science, which not only broadens students\u2019 design vision, but also broadens their knowledge. Furthermore, under the guidance of local characteristics, it\u2019s necessary to start from the study of art theory and extend to the perspective of art practice. After that, the perspective of art works can be developed. According to the demand of the market, the process of developing towards art commodities can form its own characteristic teaching mode if it goes on for a long time[5]. Secondly, it is necessary for higher private colleges to integrate the real projects of social posts into practical teaching and strictly control the quality to extend the implementation of diversified teaching methods. Private colleges are required to increase the proportion of practical courses, which can turn the results of students\u2019 graduation projects into artistic commodities and complete the teaching evaluation in the college-enterprise cooperation. The path needs to be extended, and the teaching path of art design \u201ctrinity\u201d can be established from classroom and in and out college, respectively, complete the docking of courses and employment. 3.2 Strengthening the practice training studio and improving the quality of practical teaching The art design major in higher private colleges needs to formulate teaching plans of different modules according to the actual demand and the characteristics. In order to adapt to the modernization, art design each major has set up different practice training studios as well as different module courses. The research direction of each studio is different, but it belongs to several Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research, volume 412",

    "title": "Exploring Learner Resilience and Performance of First-Year Computer Science Undergraduate Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "abstract": "This paper presents the findings from a research project exploring the impact of learner resilience as part of the shift to online delivery of learning, teaching and assessment amidst national \"lockdown\" measures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This exploration of resilience was undertaken as part of the delivery of a first-year undergraduate computer science degree programme in a UK higher education institution over two academic years. Resilience was measured by the Nicholson McBride Resilience Questionnaire (NMRQ). The responses from the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 student cohorts (N=214) illustrate that overall learner resilience as measured by NMRQ does not appear to have had a significant impact upon learner success as measured by the mean overall first-year performance. This is an outcome that differs from previous work and may be a consequence of the disruptive (and ongoing) circumstances arising from the pandemic. However, this work identifies that the factor \"I try to control events rather than being a victim of my circumstances\" appears to promote success and the factor \"I trust my intuition\" may have been slightly detrimental to overall success. As we start to consider the post-pandemic new (ab)normal, learners will continue to face significant personal challenges that will impact upon their engagement with their studies and their performance and progression; thus the insights offered from this UK university study can help to inform emerging academic and pastoral practice for undergraduate computer science education.",

    "title": "A Fuzzy-Based Evaluation of E-Learning Acceptance and Effectiveness by Computer Science Students in Greece in the Period of COVID-19",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a fuzzy-based evaluation method is presented for the impact of e-learning on several aspects of the learning lives of academic students of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the academic year 2020\u20132021 was considered when a general lockdown was imposed in Greece and all courses were delivered exclusively through the web. The evaluation criteria are (i) e-learning acceptance, (ii) learning effectiveness, (iii) students\u2019 engagement and (iv) socializing and interpersonal relationships in the educational community. The evaluation was conducted through questionnaires. Ninety two (92) undergraduate and postgraduate students and Ten (10) computer science in-structors of the department of Informatics of the University of Piraeus, Greece, participated in this survey. The questionnaire answers were analyzed using a fuzzy-based mechanism. Particularly, five fuzzy sets were used to describe the 5-point Likert scale answers to the questionnaires with linguistic values, and four other fuzzy sets were used for the description of the evaluation results concerning the four defined evaluation criteria. Moreover, 209 fuzzy rules were created to analyze and calculate the evaluation results per criterion, considering both the students\u2019 answers (119 fuzzy rules) and the instructors\u2019 answers (90 fuzzy rules) to the questionnaires. The gain of this approach is that the analysis of evaluation data with fuzzy rules imitates the human way of thinking and, thus, makes the process more explainable. The evaluation results showed a positive impact of e-learning on student confidence, self-discipline and active participation and a negative impact on student interpersonal relationships. The impact of e-learning on other learning issues was neutral.",

    "abstract": "Two datasets, published by the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) related to Indiana schools\u2019 implementation of virtual education and computer science (CS) instruction during the 2020-2021 school year, were analyzed. This research aims to explore schools\u2019 virtual instructional practices during the unprecedented educational disruptions and understand the preparedness and execution of CS curricula. With quantitative and qualitative approaches, we first evaluated the percentages of different instructional modes, school districts\u2019 implementation of virtual instruction, their support for students, successes and barriers schools experienced, as well as their future plans regarding virtual learning. Findings indicate that hybrid and virtual instruction were prevalent, with disparities in technology access and instructional quality, and schools shared barriers related to technology resources, teacher preparedness, and student engagement. In addition, this study reveals the unequal implementation of CS education, particularly in lower grade levels, underscoring the need for more dedicated resources and teacher support. These insights may help inform future educational strategies for multi-modality instruction and enhance the integration of CS education in K-12 curricula. \nKeywords: virtual instruction, computer science education, Indiana schools, technology access, teacher support. \u00a0",

    "abstract": "This study attempts to map the publication delay of articles published in an international, peer-reviewed, open access Library and Information Science journal (LIS) i.e. the DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information Technology (DJLIT). An exploratory method was applied to collect data related to the editorial timeline through archival open access to the articles published in DJLIT during the period from 2012 to 2020. Data were tabulated in an Excel spreadsheet to facilitate statistical analysis and interpretation. The study finds a mean and median waiting time of approximately 176 days and 152 days respectively for articles before they got published. About 64.57 percent of articles went through revision. The majority of articles (i.e., 40.08%) experienced a delay between 100-199 days and were closely followed by 26.11 percent of articles with a delay of up to 99 days. Only 2.43 percent of articles fell in the 400-499 days delay category before being published. A strong influence of time between submission to final revision on overall publication delay was observed. The study did not find any correlation between the number of contributing authors and increasing delay in publication and contradicts the result obtained in another study on selected information science journals. The study is expected to help researchers and authors in the field of LIS to take informed decision before submitting their manuscripts to DJLIT for publication.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 forced higher education institutions to reinvent themselves. The (usually) face-to-face education has swapped to distance contingency education. This change brought about numerous challenges that impose adjustments in several dimensions, such as pedagogical strategies and the dependence on teaching platforms and computer systems\u2014and, above all, the new relationship between the various actors (students, teachers, and management staff). All the sudden changes, combined with uncertainty concerning what was happening, created several strategies and options. This paper has the main purpose of analyzing the scientific production on higher education of EU27 academic institutions during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in journals indexed in Clarivate Analytics\u2019 Web of Science and Elsevier\u2019s Scopus. The sample is composed of 22 articles in total. The results show that the articles were published in 19 journals; their main focuses are Higher Education, COVID-19, and distance learning. In our database, we find several types of concerns, which shows that HEIs have a wide range of dimensions. We intend this article to be an instrument, not only to identify what was done in 2020, but to point out clues for the future.",

    "title": "Marked crosswalks in US transit-oriented station areas, 2007\u20132020: A computer vision approach using street view imagery",
    "abstract": "Improving the built environment to support walking is a popular strategy to increase urban sustainability and walkability. In the past decade alone, many US cities have implemented crosswalk visibility enhancement programs as part of road safety improvements and active transportation plans. However, there are no systematic ways of measuring and monitoring the presence of key built environment attributes that influence the safety and walkability of an area, such as marked crosswalks. Furthermore, little is known about how these attributes change over time at a national scale. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach using a deep learning-based computer vision model on Street View images to identify changes in intersection-level marked crosswalks around more than 4,000 US transit stations over a 14-year period. We found an increase in the overall number of marked crosswalks at intersections. Furthermore, high-visibility crosswalks became more common, as they replaced existing parallel-line crosswalks. We further examine crosswalks around transit stations in New York City and San Francisco to illustrate geographic variations and compare associations with other characteristics of the built environment as reported in the Smart Location Database. Areas with increases in high-visibility crosswalks focused on high density residential areas and areas with a higher percent of zero-vehicle households. However, geographic variations exist. For example, in San Francisco, transit station areas outside downtown or major corridors (South and Southwest of the city) had the lower prevalence of marked crosswalks. This analysis confirms important gaps in crosswalk visibility that call for safety enhancements and opens the door for additional research involving these data. We conclude by discussing the limitations and future research opportunities using computer vision to automatically detect large-scale transportation infrastructure changes at a relatively low cost.",

    "abstract": "This experience report focuses on the community of Israeli high school computer science (CS) teachers during the corona pandemic. Like most educational systems worldwide, which were suddenly shut down during the outbreak of the corona pandemic, the Israeli education system was closed from March 12, 2020 until the end of the school year. However, since the national CS matriculation exam was scheduled for June 24, 2020, and since not all teachers finished teaching all of the required material and preparing their pupils for the exam, the Central CS Supervisory Unit, at the Ministry of Education, launched the CS-orona initiative whose purpose was to support teachers and pupils in their preparation for the matriculation exam. The initiative was implemented mainly (but not only) through Zoom presentations by volunteer teachers, who presented lessons to their colleagues and to pupils located throughout Israel. In this paper, we present the framework of the CS-orona initiative, teachers? perceptions of its effectiveness, and lessons learned. Data was collected through questionnaires sent to (a) teachers who attended the lessons; (b) teachers who presented lessons to other teachers and pupils; and (c) pupils located throughout the country. We analyzed the data mainly according to Maslow's theory of needs, and show that the CS-orona initiative a) enabled teachers who attended lessons to fulfill their needs for safety and b) enabled teachers who presented lessens, to fulfill their need for belongingness and need for appreciation and self-esteem.",

    "abstract": "Online learning had a decisive role in all levels of education during the pandemic. In this study, we will explore adult vocational education students of computer science that experienced the online education during the school academic year 2020\u20132021. The study attempts to explore the views of 10 adult students. At the same time, an attempt is made to determine the role of educational neuroscience in students' learning. Participants were asked to answer 14 questions about the online education they had experienced. This was followed by data analysis using NVivo software. According to the findings, 6 students identified the reasons why they prefer to be educated in a physical learning environment and 1 student stated that he prefers a mixed model that will include lessons with both physical and online presence. In addition, 9 out of 10 students stated that they prefer synchronous online teaching to asynchronous. Also, 7 out of 10 students identified that in the theoretical part they were able to achieve the expected learning outcomes but on the other hand, 6 out of 10 learners reported difficulties in attending the workshops. Nevertheless, 8 out of 10 stated that they were quite consistent with the obligations they had during the course. The findings indicate that the principles of educational neuroscience can be a critical component of effective online learning.",

    "title": "Pedagogical Interventions to Improve the Outcomes of Hispanics in AP Computer Science",
    "abstract": "A year-long proof-of-concept research project explored the impact of utilizing pedagogical strategies from teaching English as a Second Language and Bilingual education to improve the outcomes of Hispanics in Advanced Placement Computer Science A (AP CSA) and AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). The project was conducted in the US during the 2019-2020 academic year with twenty-two AP Computer Science teachers. The intervention was evaluated by comparing the College Board's 2020 national and state AP CSA and AP CSP exam statistics with the aggregate scores of the students in the classroom of the project's teacher cohort. Teacher surveys were also used to evaluate the impact of the study on teacher's perception and teaching practices. Results from this research show that Hispanic students in the research cohort passed the AP CSP test at the same rate as all students passing the AP CSP test in the cohort. This contrasts favorably with the national and state Hispanic passing AP CSP test takers which are reported as 10 to 13% below all students AP CSP passing test takers. The pedagogical interventions used here are one approach to promote equity in computer science education. This paper presents a description of the project, a comparison of the project's data to the 2020 national and state AP CSA and AP CSP exam statistics, a summary of the teacher survey data and recommendations for continued research in this area.",

    "title": "Assessment of the Online Teaching mode in the Subject of Geography at Undergraduate Level from Student's Perspective during the Academic Year 2020-21 : A Case Study",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 resulted in the abrupt shutting of all the educational institutions (schools, colleges, and universities) in India. This resulted in dramatic changes in the education system with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Online learning is a competent and contactless method of teaching to remotely located students. \nGeography is a branch of science which deals with the study of the earth\u2019s surface and the relationships between people and their environment. Geographers explore both the physical properties of the earth\u2019s surface and the human societies spread across it. The subject matter of Geography containing different theory papers and practical papers cannot just be effectively taught in a classroom or laboratory but best enlightened on the field. For the effective learning process in the subject of Geography, students require on-ground observations, laboratory analysis, projects and dissertations, field surveying, computer mapping and analysis, field trips and excursions, etc. It helps the budding Geographers to acquire not only theoretical knowledge but also practical skills.\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic situation confronted the education system, forcing the educators in the field of Geography to shift to an online mode of teaching, leaving them with no option. During this crisis, the educators have given their best in teaching the subject matter of Geography to the students by using various open-source teaching aids by overcoming the issues like lack of training and professional technical support. This altered the traditional teaching and learning process in the field of Geography, which essentially affects the students of Geography. \nThus, a case study was undertaken to assess the online teaching in the subject of Geography at the undergraduate level during the academic year 2020-21 from the student\u2019s perspective.",

    "abstract": "The Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) Recognition Challenges aim to advance and capture the state-of-the-art in locomotion and transportation mode recognition from smartphone motion (inertial) sensors. The goal of this series of machine learning and data science challenges was to recognize eight locomotion and transportation activities (Still, Walk, Run, Bus, Car, Train, Subway). The three challenges focused on time-independent (SHL 2018), position-independent (SHL 2019) and user-independent (SHL 2020) evaluations, respectively. Overall, we received 48 submissions (out of 93 teams who registered interest) involving 201 scientists over the three years. The survey captures the state-of-the-art through a meta-analysis of the contributions to the three challenges, including approaches, recognition performance, computational requirements, software tools and frameworks used. It was shown that state-of-the-art methods can distinguish with relative ease most modes of transportation, although the differentiating between subtly distinct activities, such as rail transport (Train and Subway) and road transport (Bus and Car) still remains challenging. We summarize insightful methods from participants that could be employed to address practical challenges of transportation mode recognition, for instance, to tackle over-fitting, to employ robust representations, to exploit data augmentation, and to exploit smart post-processing techniques to improve performance. Finally, we present baseline results to compare the three challenges with a unified recognition pipeline and decision window length.",

    "abstract": "For decades, a student's preparation for licensure to teach has been rather standard with increased time in field placements culminating with a semester of student teaching. During the Spring 2020, this changed for preservice students scheduled to \u201cstudent teach.\u201d Due to COVID\u201019, schools closed for several weeks and re\u2010opened online. The current wisdom on student teaching and induction is based on research conducted within an in\u2010person environment. Little research exists on the experiences of these teachers. Therefore, we used an exploratory, descriptive case study design to understand the 18\u2010month experience of one biology teacher as he navigated student teaching and his first\u2010year induction. Twenty\u2010nine conversations were conducted (recorded, transcribed, and analyzed) between March 2020 and May 2021. In addition to telling John's story, the four themes of (a) other ways became the norm, (b) no wisdom from elders, (c) I built it but they did not come, and (d) what happened to hall, bus, club, or cafeteria duty were found. We anticipate the information from this study will help educators rethink and reconstruct science teacher preparation and induction in ways that will help in a nontraditional environment.

    "abstract": "\n In democratic societies around the world, the number of science policy decisions is increasing. One of the fundamental principles of democracy is that citizens should be able to understand the issues before them. Using a 63-year cross-sectional US data set, we use confirmatory factor analysis to construct and test a two-dimensional measure of attitude to science and technology that has been relatively stable over the last six decades. Previous and current research tells us that only one in three US adults is scientifically literate, meaning that trust in scientific expertise is important to many citizens. We find that trust in scientific expertise polarized during the Trump administration. Using the same data set, we construct two structural equation models to determine the factors that predict positive attitudes toward science and technology. Comparing 2016 and 2020, we find that the Trump attacks on science did not reduce public support for science.",

    "title": "Meeting Students Where they Are: A Virtual Computer Science Education Research (CSER) Experience for Undergraduates (REU)",
    "abstract": "Currently, the computer science community is experiencing a rise in interest in computer science education research (CSER). However, current structures and belief systems within the discipline have largely relegated computer science education researchers to the margins. Computer science education researchers are mainly 'lone-wolf' scholars in their departments that participate in CSER in addition to their more widely 'accepted' computer science research. As such, there has been a resistance to offer doctoral programs in CSER. Florida International University has not only invested inCSER by hiring a CSER tenure-track faculty member, they have also established a School of Computer Science Education and Engineering Education. Despite this investment, one obstacle remains the low visibility and understanding of computer science education research among undergraduate students. This makes establishing are search group of Ph.D. students challenging. In order to combat this obstacle, a four-year program was developed as a dedicated pipeline to the computer science education Ph.D. through a series of research experiences for undergraduates (REU). Summer 2020 consisted of the first cohort of this four year commitment. Given that 2020 was wrought with a series of unprecedented events, this REU was designed and executed virtually. This paper presents the plan, setting, execution, and subsequent evaluation of this virtual REU experience. Student-feedback was overwhelmingly positive; however, as with any endeavor there were many lessons learned.",

    "title": "A Systematic Review of Computer Science Solutions for Addressing Violence Against Women and Children",
    "abstract": "Violence against women and children is a public health issue of pandemic proportions. It is estimated that one in every three women worldwide has experienced physical, emotional, or sexual violence. Similarly, each year one out of two children are victims of some form of violence including domestic aggression and bullying. Due to the widespread use of the Internet and social media, women and children are now vulnerable to other types of violence such as cyber-bullying and online sexual or emotional harassment. To help alleviate this social problem, the use of computer science and related technologies has been leveraged in recent years. The Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, ubiquitous and mobile computing, pattern recognition, cloud computing and similar technologies, have been used to formulate solutions to detect and prevent violent acts against women and children. In this paper, a systematic review of some of the efforts that can help address the problem of violence against women and children is presented. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art of these contributions and identifies trends, architectures, technologies, and current open challenges. The survey was developed using a literature review of academic documents published from 2010 to 2020. The contributions were categorized into four application domains: online detection, offline detection, safety, and education. These contributions were further categorized based on the computer science approaches and technologies used: artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and digital serious games.",

    "abstract": "As undergraduate enrollment in computer science (CS) courses continues to expand, concerns surrounding the supply of instructors and the quality of instruction become even more salient. Similarly, computing education and computational thinking programs are expanding in K12 schools but are hampered by concerns over teacher training and curriculum efficacy. This project sought to answer a question: is there a need for a more robust system of networking and resources for computer science education (CSEd) graduate students' The large response to initial community-building efforts indicates that this is likely the case. In just over one year, a global community of 190 graduate students and 90 CS faculty researchers and advisors have registered for a CSEd graduate focused community. Participant funding, while originally intended for in-person conference attendance and face-to-face meetings, has enabled this project to create study groups attended by 73 students and a virtual conference with 101 participants. These activities were established as a result of a needs assessment survey conducted in early 2020. This poster documents the rapid growth of this community and the need students feel for systematic support.",

    "title": "Analysis of science, technology and innovation (STI) policies of India from 1958 to 2020",
    "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyse innovation policies in India from 1958 to 2020. A policy tools framework was developed to compare the innovation policies in India. India developed and implemented four innovation policies from 1958 to 2013. The recent policy change was brought in the year 2020 with releasing the draft of the Science, Technology and Innovation Policy (STIP 2020). The authors analysed the recent draft of STIP 2020 with the earlier four innovation policies.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nInnovation policies implemented from 1958 to 2013 in India were studied and analysed in the \u201ctext as a data approach\u201d and a comparative policy analysis tool was designed for this purpose. The recent draft of STIP 2020 was evaluated and the provisions of the fifth draft of STIP 2020 were compared with the previous four innovation policies' design and formulation. The CPA tool design consists of five broad themes Awareness and capacity building; Finance and infrastructure; Resource management and governance; Outreach and networking; and Policy implementation and evaluation.\n\n\nFindings\nDraft STIP 2020 has many features similar to earlier policies. However, policy has focused on bringing in more clarity about national challenges, goals and objectives, yet it needs better implementation to achieve stated outcomes more effectively and efficiently. New initiatives include strengthening the innovation system with open science, improving STI education, expanding the financial landscape, establishing national STI observatory acting as a central repository of all data related to the STI ecosystem and accountable research ecosystem, promoting translational and foundational research of global standards, promoting entrepreneurship, self-reliance, mainstream science communication and public engagement and decentralised institutional mechanisms. Thus, the STIP 2020 is ambitious in its approach to promoting STI in India and needs a supportive mechanism to achieve the stated objectives.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nCurrent comparative policy analysis focused only on identifying similarities and differences among innovation policies implemented in India from 1958 to 2020 and its evolutionary changes in policy and its instruments choice. The recent draft STIP 2020 is not approved and has no update regarding its approval and implementation by the government. The revised and yet to implement STIP 2020 may have variances in the policy instruments. The earlier policies are so broad and without specific problem statements. They were released as statements and resolutions which makes it is challenging to understand the impact of each policy. Similar policy tools in STI 2013 and STIP 2020 were only considered to observe the policy instrument choice. The achievements of the innovation policies implemented before STIP 2020 are not included. Evolutionary changes in the problem statements and policy tools prescribed in innovation policies are studied.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nDepartment of Science and Technology, Government of India, released a draft of STIP in 2020. The draft of STIP was evaluated with previous Innovation Policies. To the authors\u2019 understanding, this is the first attempt to evaluate the STIPs of India using the \u201ctext as a data\u201d approach. The tool can be validated by using it for CPA of innovation policies of other emerging, developed and least developed economies to understand cross-country variations in policy instrument choice by policymakers.\n",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused the start of the academic year 2020/2021 to be conditioned by health and safety regulations. The present research was defined with the aim of analyzing the degree of satisfaction and perceptions on the establishment of bubble groups and pairs and on the use of audiovisual platforms for the development of theoretical and practical university teaching in three degrees of health sciences. A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on a representative sample of students and teachers of health sciences in Ponferrada (n = 285). Specific questionnaires designed for this study were completed virtually during April and May 2021. The results indicate that that satisfaction was moderate\u2013high. The perception of the influence of bubble pairs on the quality of teaching can be interpreted as very low. These results increase with the age and academic and professional experience of students and faculty members, respectively. However, the participants belonging to physiotherapy considered that the quality of teaching had worsened much more compared to their counterparts in nursing and podiatry.",

    "title": "Social Bots and Social Media Manipulation in 2020: The Year in Review",
    "abstract": "The year 2020 will be remembered for two events of global significance: the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. In this chapter, we summarize recent studies using large public Twitter data sets on these issues. We have three primary objectives. First, we delineate epistemological and practical considerations when combining the traditions of computational research and social science research. A sensible balance should be struck when the stakes are high between advancing social theory and concrete, timely reporting of ongoing events. We additionally comment on the computational challenges of gleaning insight from large amounts of social media data. Second, we characterize the role of social bots in social media manipulation around the discourse on the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Third, we compare results from 2020 to prior years to note that, although bot accounts still contribute to the emergence of echo-chambers, there is a transition from state-sponsored campaigns to domestically emergent sources of distortion. Furthermore, issues of public health can be confounded by political orientation, especially from localized communities of actors who spread misinformation. We conclude that automation and social media manipulation pose issues to a healthy and democratic discourse, precisely because they distort representation of pluralism within the public sphere.",

    "abstract": "Understanding research philosophies and approaches are important for identifying appropriate research design, their suitability, reliability and validity for research projects. Here, research philosophies and approaches employed by contributors to the Journal of Science and Technology (JUST) from the year 2000 to 2020 are reviewed. All papers (580 articles) were retrieved from African Journals Online (AJOL), the KNUST institutional repository and the JUST Website. The papers were grouped to reflect the academic disciplines offered at KNUST, the publishers of JUST. The abstracts of the papers were first scrutinised to appreciate the contents and collated keywords. Thereafter, the introduction, materials and methods, results, discussion, and conclusions sections were thoroughly critiqued. The findings revealed that positivism rooted in deductive reasoning dominates the JUST accounting for 87.8% of articles. The use of quantitative analytical tools namely, statistical analysis (68.27%), simulation (7.41%) and mathematical modelling (0.17%) featured in the order presented. Interpretivism rooted in inductive reasoning/qualitative analytical tools represented 14.31% in use. Agriculture, Health and Pure Sciences widely used statistics whilst disciplines in Engineering relied mostly on simulation and modelling. While Agriculture used mostly inferential statistics, the health-related disciplines produced mostly descriptive statistics. Social sciences and humanities including Library and Information studies relied largely on descriptive statistics except economics, which was dominated by inferential statistics. Built environment research relied largely on descriptive statistics while Art-based programmes rely largely on qualitative approaches and narrations. These findings are important in helping the JUST to identify the strengths and weak areas towards encouraging a multi philosophically inclusive publications in the JUST, as a multidisciplinary academic journal. The findings could be helpful to the management of JUST and interested stakeholders towards expanding the profile of research publications knowledge promotion and as training manual for potential authors.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is one of the common adverse drug reactions and the leading cause of drug development attritions, black box warnings, and post-marketing withdrawals. Current biomarkers are suboptimal in detecting DILI and predicting its outcome. This study aimed to quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the research trends on DILI biomarkers using bibliometric analysis. All relevant publications were extracted from the Web of Science database. An online analysis platform of literature metrology, bibliographic item co-occurrence matrix builder, and CiteSpace software were used to analyze the publication trends. CitNetExplorer was used to construct direct citation networks and VOSviewer was used to analyze the keywords and research hotspots. We found a total of 485 publications related to DILI biomarkers published from 1991 to 2020. Toxicological Sciences had been the most popular journal in this field over the past 30\u2009years. The USA maintained a top position worldwide and provided a pivotal influence, followed by China. Among all the institutions, the University of Liverpool was regarded as a leader for research collaboration. Moreover, Professors Paul B. Watkins and Tsuyoshi Yokoi made great achievements in topic area. We analyzed the citation networks and keywords, therefore identified five and six research hotspot clusters, respectively. We considered the publication information regarding different countries/regions, organizations, authors, journals, et al. by summarizing the literature on DILI biomarkers over the past 30\u2009years. Notably, the subject of DILI biomarkers is an active area of research. In addition, the investigation and discovery of novel promising biomarkers such as microRNAs, keratin18, and bile acids will be future developing hotspots.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to study research regarding the context-based learning approach in science education between 2010 and 2020 in Turkey. In this study, a descriptive content analysis method was used to analyzed 86 articles on context-based learning in science education published in 67 different journals. According to some variables such as the year of publication, purpose, area, method, sample, number of samples, data collection tool and data analysis techniques. The Research Classification Form developed by the researchers was used in the analysis of the data. The data were analyzed using descriptive content analysis. Most studies in the field of context-based learning approaches in science education were published in 2019. Most of the studies aimed to determine the effects of the method on achievement and attitude and were carried out within science. The experimental method was preferred among the quantitative methods in the studies. Most of the studies were conducted with secondary school students, and the number of participants was in the range of 0-100. Achievement tests and attitude scales were used extensively as data collection tools, and content analysis and t-test were used extensively in data analysis techniques. According to the results obtained in the research, it is suggested that the researches on the context-based learning approach should be conducted in areas other than science education.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. The dynamics of Russian sociology research are analyzed for the period of 1993\u20142020. Methods. The sources of information for the study were three databases on the Web of Science platform: SSCI, SCI-E, and A&HCI. The main method of research was bibliometric analy\u00adsis. Results and Discussion. The percentage of publications in sociology among the social sciences in the world as a whole has gradually declined over the 28-year period: from 4.7 % in 1993 to 2.3 % in 2020. The decline in the same indicator for Russian publications began only in 2008. It should be noted that this indicator is significantly higher than that for the world as a whole: the average percentage of publications in sociol\u00adogy for the entire period for the world was 3.2 %, for Russia \u2014 16.4 %. The percentage of the world's Open Access publications in sociology is lower than that for the social sciences as a whole, but the growth rate is very high: 1.7 % in 1993 and 34.1 % in 2020. In the case of Rus\u00adsian sociology publications, the Open Access system has only become relatively active in 2013. In 2020, the total percentage of such publi\u00adcations was 7.9 %. Two approaches were used to define the thematic range of sociology research and the level of sociology's connection to other scientific fields. One is based on identifying publications that are common to two of the scientific fields under study, the other involves on identifying publications that were simultaneously cited in different scientific fields. Application of these approaches demonstrated that the second approach, as compared with the first, allowed to reveal much more extensive thematic connections of sociology with other scientific directions. At the same time, the application of rank correlation methods showed that the results obtained using these two different approaches are characterized by a sufficient degree of consistency. Conclusion. The data obtained on the percentage of publications in sociology in national and world science can be used by various state and public structures in the development of scientific policy in the field of social sciences. Data on sociology's connections with other disciplines and their quantitative characteristics can serve as background material for subsequent quali\u00adtative (substantive) analysis of these connections.",

What are students\u2019 feelings and opinions towards online education? 3. What are the impacts of distance learning on students\u2019 development of their PCK skills? And 4. What is students\u2019 academic achievement in taught online science education courses? To collect data, a total sample of 117 students enrolled in undergraduate program for science teaching at the elementary level, was used. Data was collected over three semesters, during the academic years 2020/2021 and 2021/2022. The data collection tools used are: a. a questionnaire administered to students enrolled in their 2nd through the 6th semesters, at the Faculty of Education, Lebanese University, at the end of science education courses, b. students\u2019 grades in formative and summative assessments in science education courses, c. students\u2019 drawing themselves as remote learners, and d. a post-interview of a purposeful sample. Data analysis was done using interim analysis in the form of post-zoom class conferences and data validation using member check at the end of courses. Findings showed that students at the beginning of the state successive and long lockdowns were happy to learn remotely. But as time passes, they were dissatisfied with online learning, 38% of students missed the campus life and 16% lacked the interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, students\u2019 academic performance decreased significantly and many were concerned about the little expertise to deal with students in real classes. For 57% of students, distance learning was difficult than classroom, and 70.5% admitted that home environment was not suitable for participating in online lectures due to distractions by their families. Quality teaching and the need for evaluation the online teaching/learning process at the level of the Faculty of Education and the Lebanese University is an urgent need.",

    "abstract": ": The Census Bureau set off reports of a \u201cmultiracial boom\u201d when it announced that, according to the 2020 census, multiracial people accounted for 10.2 percent of the U.S. population. Only the year before, the bureau\u2019s American Community Survey had estimated their share as 3.4 percent. We provide evidence that the multiracial boom was largely a statistical illusion resulting from methodological changes that confounded ancestry with identity and mistakenly equated national origin with race. Under a new algorithm, respondents were auto-recoded as multiracial if, after marking a single race, they listed an \u201corigin\u201d that the algorithm did not recognize as falling within that race. However, origins and identity are not the same; confounding the two did not improve racial statistics. The fictitious multiracial boom highlights the power of official statistics in framing public and social-science understanding and the need to keep ancestry and identity distinct in both theory and empirical practice.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: One of the developments in the era of technology and communication is daily access, for example the internet, which is useful for being able to search for information and provide it to other people. The large amount of incoming information can cause many works to be plagiarized, and one way to prevent this is to use the Turnitin application. The aim of this research is to find out how users perceive the understanding of the Turnitin application to prevent plagiarism in Islamic library and information science research programs.\nData Collection Methods: This research uses quantitative descriptive research. Respondents were taken from Islamic Library and Information Science students for the 2019/2020 academic year, totaling 123 students, with a sample size of 55 respondents calculated using the Slovin formula. Data was collected using a questionnaire distributed via Google Form and measured using a Likert scale.\nData Analysis: Data analysis uses (1) Variable description analysis, (2) Normality test with the Kolmogrov Smirnov formula to see whether the data is normal or not, (3) Linearity test with a significance value of Deviation from linearity >0.05 then linear, (4) Linear regression test to ensure the relationship between variables x and y.\nResults and Discussion: The research results show that students' perceptions of the cognitive aspect have the highest index value, while the aspect that needs to be improved is the affection aspect. Student understanding comes from externally. For the simple linear regression test requirements, the data must be valid, reliable, normal and linear, therefore by using a simple linear regression analysis test you can look for relationships to obtain a correlation/relationship value (R) of 0.415. The determinant coefficient (R Square) value obtained through SPSS data processing is 0.172, indicating that the independent variable (perception) has an influence of 17.2% on the dependent variable (understanding).\nConclusion: Libraries need to hold workshops on plagiarism or Turnitin to check word similarities to identify plagiarism in final assignments and articles. The target is the entire academic community (lecturers, staff, and students). Therefore, it is hoped that these findings can become the basis for further research and can be continued.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the employability of the graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA) and Bachelor of Agricultural Technology (BAT) programs. The study further aimed to gather inputs about the BSA and BAT program that could be used to improve its quality education.\n\nThe respondents were BSA and BAT graduates from 2018- 2020. Data collected were subjected to basic statistical tools such as frequency, percentage, proportions and means.\n\nFindings of the study indicate that 27.59% of the respondents under BSA program in 2018, 28.57% in 2019 while 0% in 2020 are all employed. Further, 80.00% under BAT are employed in 2018, 18.18% in 2019 and 58.33% in 2020. However, 72.41% from BSA and 20% from BAT program are unemployed in 2018. In 2019, it came out that the 71.43% from BSA and 81.82% from BAT program respondents are unemployed in 2019. Moreover, in 2020 three (3) BAT graduates are unemployed. While 41.67% in BAT graduates are unemployed in the year 2020. These are due to lack of applications and exposures as the main weakness. Also, some of our graduated students already have work, but they were relieved from their current work due to change of government which is the BARMM now. Consistently, the primary recommendations were to have more exposures and applications of the respondents. Furthermore, this finding was able to collect data from the graduate\u2019s using questioners and thru online survey via messenger and face book page.",

    "abstract": "Urban science plays a pivotal role in understanding the complex interactions between fireworks, air quality, and urban environments. Dense firework smoke worsens air quality and poses a health hazard to the public. In this study, we show a situation where extremely foggy meteorological conditions coincided with intense anthropogenic emissions, including fireworks, in an urban area. For the first time, the chemical composition and sources of non-refractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM1) in outdoor and indoor air were characterized in Vilnius (Lithuania) using an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and Positive Matrix Factorization for the period before the fireworks, on New Year\u2019s Eve, and after the fireworks in 2020/2021; thus, typical changes were assessed. Due to stagnant weather conditions and increased traffic, the highest concentrations of black carbon (BC) (13.8 \u03bcg/m3) were observed before the fireworks display. The contribution of organic (Org) fraction to the total NR-PM1 mass concentration, in the comparison of the values of a typical night and New Year\u2019s Eve (from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.), increased from 43% to 70% and from 47% to 60% in outdoor and indoor air, respectively. Biomass-burning organic aerosol (BBOA, 48% (44%)) and hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA, 35% (21%)) dominated the organic fraction indoors and outdoors, respectively. HOA was likely linked to increased traffic during the event, while BBOA may have been related to domestic heating and fireworks.",

    "abstract": "A general-purpose Global Research Data Infrastructure (GRDI) for all sciences and research purposes is not conceivable for the next decade as there are too many discipline-specific modalities that currently prevail for such generalisation efforts to be effective. On the other hand, a more pragmatic approach is to start from what currently exists, identify best practices and key issues, and promote effective inter-domain collaboration among different components forming an ecosystem. This will promote interoperability, data exchange, data preservation, and distributed access (among others). This ecosystem of interoperable research data infrastructures will be composed of regional, disciplinary, and multidisciplinary components, such as libraries, archives, and data centres, offering data services for both primary datasets and publications. The ecosystem will support data-intensive science and research and stimulate the interaction among all its elements, thus promoting multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary science. This special issue includes a set of independent papers from renowned experts on organisational and technological issues related to GRDIs. These documents feed into and compliment the GRDI2020 roadmap, which supports a Global Research Data Infrastructure ecosystem.",

    "title": "First-year students\u2019 experience with engaging with curricular online at a private higher education institution during COVID-19",
    "abstract": "The year 2020 witnessed a paradigm shift commonly referred to as the \"new normal\" because to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, which had a profound impact on the lives of several students across the globe. The significant transformation posed a perplexing situation for freshmen at higher education institutions. The implementation of COVID-19 limits precipitated an abrupt digital transformation for students, necessitating the surmounting of significant obstacles. This study aimed to investigate the experiences of first-year students enrolled at a private postsecondary institution in the context of online learning. The study additionally aimed to ascertain the difficulties encountered by individuals while accessing online learning amidst the current tumultuous circumstances. The study employed a qualitative methodology in response to its inherent character. A sample size of six students was chosen from a cohort of first-year students, while three lecturers who teach first-year students were picked using random selection techniques. The data was gathered through various methods, including face-to-face interviews, focus group talks, and questionnaires. Subsequently, the data was subjected to analysis utilizing the Nvivo program. The findings derived from the research indicate that it is imperative to comprehend the experiences, computer literacy skills, and perspectives of first-year students in order to offer suitable assistance to forthcoming first-year students engaging in online learning and ultimately enhance lecturers' online instructional methodologies. The findings additionally indicate that students encountered difficulties not only in adapting to online learning but also in dealing with various social and emotional elements that had an impact on their learning experience, hence exacerbating the issues they faced.",

    "abstract": "Available records of computer programming results from the universities in southeast Nigeria for the period under review (2016\u20132020) show that 70% of the students marginally passed the course. This, therefore, raises a concern to re\u2010examine the instructional strategy used in the teaching and learning process, hence the adoption of innovative pedagogy that involved the use of digital tools like Google Classroom and Google Meet in their instructional delivery process of a computer programming course. This study adopted quasi\u2010experimental research design involving intact classes with a nonequivalent group. Total population sampling technique was used to select all the 152 second\u2010year computer education students made up of 60 males and 92 females drawn from the three private universities in Southeast Nigeria that offer computer programming. Data was collected using computer achievement test, digital skill development scale and engagement level scale. The findings of the study showed that students' academic achievement and level of engagement increased significantly in a computer programming course. Also, digital skills development and self\u2010efficacy in the experimental group were higher than in the control group. Implementing innovative teaching strategies helped to facilitate the timely development of digital skills required by students to attain sufficient learner engagement in the learning process. It was recommended that computer educators should be encouraged to adopt innovative teaching techniques that blend with Classroom, Google Meet and MS Teams, among others to influence students' active engagement in the learning process.",

    "title": "Spatiotemporally consistent global dataset of the GIMMS leaf area index (GIMMS LAI4g) from 1982 to 2020",
    "abstract": "Abstract. Leaf area index (LAI) with an explicit biophysical meaning is a critical variable to characterize terrestrial ecosystems. Long-term global datasets of LAI have served as fundamental data support for monitoring vegetation dynamics and exploring its interactions with other Earth components. However, current LAI products face several limitations associated with spatiotemporal consistency. In this study, we employed the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and a data consolidation method to generate a new version of the half-month 1/12\u2218 Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) LAI product, i.e., GIMMS LAI4g, for the period 1982\u20132020. The significance of the GIMMS LAI4g was the use of the latest PKU GIMMS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product and 3.6\u00a0million high-quality global Landsat LAI samples to remove the effects of satellite orbital drift and sensor degradation and to develop spatiotemporally consistent BPNN models. The results showed that the GIMMS LAI4g exhibited overall higher accuracy and lower underestimation than its predecessor (GIMMS LAI3g) and two mainstream LAI products (Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI and Long-term Global Mapping (GLOBMAP) LAI) using field LAI measurements and Landsat LAI samples. Its validation against Landsat LAI samples revealed an R2 of 0.96, root mean square error of 0.32\u2009m2\u2009m\u22122, mean absolute error of 0.16\u2009m2\u2009m\u22122, and mean absolute percentage error of 13.6\u2009% which meets the accuracy target proposed by the Global Climate Observation System. It outperformed other LAI products for most vegetation biomes in a majority area of the land. It efficiently eliminated the effects of satellite orbital drift and sensor degradation and presented a better temporal consistency before and after the year 2000. The consolidation with the reprocessed MODIS LAI allows the GIMMS LAI4g to extend the temporal coverage from 2015 to a recent period (2020), producing the LAI trend that maintains high consistency before and after 2000 and aligns with the reprocessed MODIS LAI trend during the MODIS era. The GIMMS LAI4g product could potentially facilitate mitigating the disagreements between studies of the long-term global vegetation changes and could also benefit the model development in earth and environmental sciences. The GIMMS LAI4g product is open access and available under Attribution 4.0 International at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7649107 (Cao et al., 2023).\n",

    "title": "Bridge Management to the Year 2020 and Beyond",
    "abstract": "During the past three decades, the art and science of bridge management has experienced significant milestones in its development and implementation. Bridge management systems (BMSs) are now entering into the mainstream of comprehensive transportation asset management. This paper is a successor to \u201cBridge Management to the Year 2000 and Beyond,\u201d which was published in the proceedings of the 1993 TRB International Conference on Bridge Management. It reviewed the progression of BMS development activities through the 1980s and the early 1990s and then envisioned these systems transitioning into real-life application. This paper reviews subsequent enhancements to the state of the art of bridge life-cycle management in view of the galloping advances in automation and communications technologies that have made, and will continue to make, an enormous impact on the potential and tools available for advancing capabilities of BMSs. Recent emergence of cradle-to-grave, integrated, and comprehensive approaches through bridge information modeling has opened up new horizons for the future of bridge management. This paper examines and projects, to the year 2020 and beyond, the substantive impact of this innovative concept on the coordinated management of the various distinct phases in the bridge life cycle, starting with preliminary and final design and proceeding through construction, day-to-day operations, and project- and network-level planning and capital programming. Further, the paper discusses potential hurdles bridge management practitioners are likely to face and potential successes they are likely to experience.",

    "title": "Science Education and the Pandemic, 1 Year On",
    "abstract": "One year has passed since my editorial about science education in the pandemic era was published online in March 2020. In one sense, it feels as though a longer period has elapsed. In another sense, it only seems a few weeks ago when I was pondering about what the impending pandemic meant for research on the applications of history, philosophy, and sociology of science in science education. Our experience of time can seem distorted and confused at times during this pandemic, as evidenced by the typographical error in that editorial where I referred to my doctoral student\u2019s research taking place in February 2019 when only 1 month had elapsed. Time seems to have taken a different meaning in our everyday lives, but can \u201ctime\u201d emerge from its benign presence in our research endeavours to become a focus of investigation for science education? In a recent paper, Levrini et al. (2021) have explored precisely this question by referring to concepts such has \u201calienation from time\u201d, \u201ctime re-appropriation\u201d, and \u201cera of future shock\u201d and drawing on perspectives from sociology of time to understand how students\u2019 daily rituals in schools detach their science learning from broader societal issues. Such concepts are providing us with new ways of interpreting what the pandemic has meant for science education in the past year. Indeed, the pandemic context is helping researchers galvanize new and fresh perspectives on how to understand and improve science education to make it relevant for today\u2019s circumstances. In this issue of Science & Education, Pietrocola and colleagues characterize the Covid-19 pandemic as \u201cmanufactured risk\u201d. The authors question new roles for science education based on \u201crisk society theory\u201d, a conceptual framework that can act as a tool for understanding how to align science education with the contemporary demands on problemsolving. They argue that students are unable to deal with manufactured risk because of the type of problems they are usually prepared to solve at school and the limited risk perception they possess. The authors propose the integration in science courses of \u201cwicked problems\u201d with a multidimensional schema that they refer to as \u201camplified risk perception space\u201d in order to identify and assess students\u2019 risk perception.

    "abstract": "Background: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune enteropathy, which is caused by gluten in people with genetic predisposition regardless of age and gender. Its presentations can vary from asymptomatic nature to severe malnutrition. Diagnosis usually depends on serology and intestinal biopsy examination. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of CD and describe its clinical presentations and diagnostic approaches among patients with gastrointestinal complaints in Sana\u2019a City, Yemen.\nMethods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted using the medical records of patients diagnosed with CD at the University of Science and Technology Hospital (USTH) from January 2020 to December 2023. Out of 350 records for CD patients diagnosed during the study period, 155 records were complete and were used in describing the clinical presentations and diagnostic methods of CD among Yemeni patients. Data about sociodemographic characteristics, clinical presentations and diagnostic methods were collected using a pre-designed data collection sheet. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the collected data.\nResults: Out of 160,000 patients attending the Gastroenterology Outpatient Department at the USTH from 2020 to 2023, 350 were diagnosed with CD, yielding a prevalence of 0.22%. The mean age of CD patients was 26 \u00b1 14.6 years, with a majority being female (71%) and over half (54.8%) falling within the 20-40 age group. Clinically, more than half of the patients presented with abdominal pain (52.9%) and diarrhea (50.3%), followed by abdominal distention (25.8%) and weight loss (21.9%). Less frequent typical symptoms included vomiting (17.4%), anorexia (12.9%), and constipation (7.7%). Among atypical manifestations, fatigue and failure to thrive (9% each) were the most common, followed by anemia (7.7%), while rickets, bruising, and delayed puberty were rare (0.6% each). Diagnostic evaluation revealed that 78.4% of 87 patients tested were positive for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and 91% of 111 patients who underwent intestinal biopsy showed characteristic mucosal changes consistent with CD.\nConclusion: The prevalence of CD among patients with gastrointestinal complaints is low, compared to the global and regional trends of the disease, predominately affecting females. It mostly presents with typical gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly abdominal pain, diarrhea and distension. Although atypical non-gastrointestinal manifestations are infrequent, CD should be considered when dealing with patients having non-gastrointestinal problems. Healthcare providers should be educated about the importance of incorporating both serology and intestinal biopsy examination for the diagnosis of patients with suspected CD.",

    "abstract": "The Sun provides the energy required to sustain life on Earth and drive our planet\u2019s atmosphere. However, establishing a solid physical connection between solar and tropospheric variability has posed a considerable challenge across the spectrum of Earth-system science. Over the past few years a new picture to describe solar variability has developed, based on observing, understanding and tracing the progression, interaction and intrinsic variability of the magnetized activity bands that belong to the Sun\u2019s 22-year magnetic activity cycle. A solar cycle\u2019s fiducial clock does not run from the canonical min or max, instead resetting when all old cycle polarity magnetic flux is cancelled at the equator, an event dubbed the \u201ctermination\u201d of that solar cycle, or terminator. In a recent paper, we demonstrated with high statistical significance, a correlation between the occurrence of termination of the last five solar cycles and the transition from El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a in the Pacific Ocean, and predicted that there would be a transition to La Ni\u00f1a in mid 2020. La Ni\u00f1a did indeed begin in mid-2020, and endured into 2023 as a rare \u201ctriple dip\u201d event, but some of the solar predictions made did not occur until late 2021. This work examines what went right, what went wrong, the correlations between El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a and geomagnetic activity indices, and what might be expected for the general trends of large-scale global climate in the next decade.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the proportion of women as first authors in major library and information science (LIS) journals over the years 1981\u20132020. Author name and year data were collected for 10 LIS journals \u2013 five that are associated more with library topics and five with information science topics \u2013 and analysed using the genderize.io tool. Both general trends over time and comparisons of information science versus library science journals are presented. The findings indicate significant growth in the proportion of women authors among the LIS journals, but primarily concentrated only among the library science journals, with information science journals falling well behind. Representation of women authors (~60%) still lags well below the overall representation of women in librarianship (~80%). These findings suggest that there is still considerable growth needed to decrease the gender gap among authorship in top LIS journals.",

    "abstract": "The 17th International Conference on X-ray Lasers (ICXRL 2020) was a milestone in several ways. Firstly, was a milestone in this scientific community because for the first time the conference came to the participants' home, due to the outbreak of the pandemics, rather than the opposite. The organization of an online event was a challenge because was a brand new platform for both the organizers and the participants, and because it was put together in less than six months. The planned physical event in Rome, already tested with one year in advance, had to be withdrawn as it posed major risks to potential participants. ICXRL 2020 was milestone also because the increased proportion of papers on technological deployment of X-ray lasers. Of course, research on fundamentals and innovation still carried an important part of this thirtyfour year event. Finally, ICXRL 2020 was a milestone also because there were participants from all five continents, no one excluded, and some were forced to incredible efforts to stay up and present their research. A great sign of inclusion. Last but not least, ICXRL 2020 saw four best presentation \"Pierre Jaegle\" awards, equally split between female and male students: Adeline Kabacinski (LOA, France), Lydia Rush (CSU, USA, see ref. [33]), Felix Wiesner (FSU, BRD), Julius Reinhard (HIJ, BRD). Another great sign of inclusion.",

    "abstract": "Background With the epidemiological transition, sociodemographic changes and differential lifetime experiences of women, women\u2019s health research improves knowledge of diverse health issues and the impact of policies. To explore the initiatives of women\u2019s health research in Korea, the present study examined the trends and topics of research on women\u2019s health funded by the government. Methods We searched all research projects on women\u2019s health funded by the government between 2012 and 2020 in Korea using the National Science & Technology Information Service database. We reviewed all the titles and abstract of the projects and examined the research trends by year. Content analysis was performed using both deductive and inductive approaches. Text network analysis and visualization by topic were conducted for keywords with a minimum of 10 occurrences in the title and abstract. Results Total number and funding amount of research projects on women\u2019s health in 2020 increased by 2.4 and 2.2 times over 2012 levels, respectively. The Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety funded 20.9% of all projects. The majority of the topics (59.8%) addressed breast and gynecological cancers. Those on sexual and reproductive health accounted for 16.7%, with steep growth in the number (6.1 times) and funding (11.1 times) over 2012 levels. The topic analysis presented a more complex keyword network in 2020 than in 2012; however, the keywords frequently used in 2020 were similar to those of 2012. Conclusion Women\u2019s health research projects have been growing in number and funding, with limited diversity in topics. Diversifying the topics and focusing on issues beyond the breast and pregnancy would be needed to reflect the complete life course of women. Institutionalization of diverse communication channels with various interest groups for women\u2019s health would be needed to better understand women\u2019s health needs from a public health perspective.",

    "abstract": "Background With the rapid development of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used in the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of a variety of diseases, including prostate cancer. Facts have proved that AI has broad prospects in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Objective This study mainly summarizes the research on the application of artificial intelligence in the field of prostate cancer through bibliometric analysis and explores possible future research hotspots. Methods The articles and reviews regarding application of AI in prostate cancer between 1999 and 2020 were selected from Web of Science Core Collection on August 23, 2021. Microsoft Excel 2019 and GraphPad Prism 8 were applied to analyze the targeted variables. VOSviewer (version 1.6.16), Citespace (version 5.8.R2), and a widely used online bibliometric platform were used to conduct co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of countries, institutions, authors, references, and keywords in this field. Results A total of 2,749 articles were selected in this study. AI-related research on prostate cancer increased exponentially in recent years, of which the USA was the most productive country with 1,342 publications, and had close cooperation with many countries. The most productive institution and researcher were the Henry Ford Health System and Tewari. However, the cooperation among most institutions or researchers was not close even if the high research outputs. The result of keyword analysis could divide all studies into three clusters: \u201cDiagnosis and Prediction AI-related study\u201d, \u201cNon-surgery AI-related study\u201d, and \u201cSurgery AI-related study\u201d. Meanwhile, the current research hotspots were \u201cdeep learning\u201d and \u201cmultiparametric MRI\u201d. Conclusions Artificial intelligence has broad application prospects in prostate cancer, and a growing number of scholars are devoted to AI-related research on prostate cancer. Meanwhile, the cooperation among various countries and institutions needs to be strengthened in the future. It can be projected that noninvasive diagnosis and accurate minimally invasive treatment through deep learning technology will still be the research focus in the next few years.",

Implementation of competency assessment at SMP Negeri 1 Jaya in Aceh Jaya Regency independently since 2020. However, the performance of the first year, the Computer-Based National Assessment, could have run better due to network factors that made it difficult to access the central server. Whereas in 2021, there were also problems with sudden power outages and the internet network weakening, causing a failure in one of the sessions. As well as the readiness of students to answer literacy and numeracy questions which are still constrained by abilities that are still below average based on the 2022 Jaya 1 Public Middle School Education report card, the literacy ability score is 1.83, and the numeracy ability score is 1.72 respectively each of them is still at level 1.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, STEM education plays an essential role in the economic growth and competitiveness of nations. This systematic review was aimed to reveal research trends in STEM education over the last 10 years. A total of 336 studies published in the Journal of Science Education and Technology, Research in Science Education, Journal of Science Teacher Education, International Journal of Science Education, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, and Science Education were selected for analysis. The time span was limited to the period between 2011 to late 2020. All sample papers were then examined to capture the latest research trends and status regarding STEM education that included the number of papers by year, research types, countries\u2019 rank, and the number of authors. To collect data, the formula proposed by Howard et al. [1] was employed to determine the most productive countries in terms of STEM education scholarships. Findings revealed that STEM education has garnered greater attention and it grew rapidly within this period. The most frequent research type used in STEM education were quantitative studies. In addition, the US, Australia, and the Netherlands were the most productive countries in STEM education research. During these ten years, most papers published in selected journals were written by three authors. This indicates that STEM education is an attractive topic to explore collaboratively by researchers and educators around the world.",

    "title": "Non-Laboratory Project-Based Learning for Final Year Bioscience Students: Lessons From COVID-19",
    "abstract": "Background: Provision of \u201cdry-lab\u201d final year honours projects, based outside the laboratory, have been proposed as a viable alternative to traditional \u201cwet-lab\u201d projects in bioscience subjects, but their value has not been widely evaluated to date. In 2020\u201321, the COVID-19 pandemic meant all students in the School of Biomedical Sciences at Ulster University (UU) undertook dry-lab projects, due to campus lockdown. Therefore, this provided an ideal opportunity to evaluate the provision of dry-lab projects in a large student cohort. Methods: A pilot group of final year students (n = 4) studying Biomedical Science at UU were interviewed to evaluate their experience of conducting a dry-lab project. This evaluation and the themes that emerged were subsequently used to inform the co-creation of a survey to appraise student experience of dry-lab research project learning across the final year student cohort in School of Biomedical Sciences (n = 140). Quantitative and qualitative data was collected and analysed for trends and themes. Results: The results of this project identified four main themes related to dry-lab projects; expectations, skills & employability, quality of experience and choice. Student expectations about dry-lab projects were not dramatically changed, although initial negative opinions of some individuals were over-turned. Most students recognised that they had developed many useful employability skills through dry-lab projects, although lack of practical laboratory experience was still perceived as a drawback. Student experience was influenced by personal circumstances but students reporting poor project experience had significantly lower levels of communication with supervisor (p < 0.05). Most students agreed that choice of dry- and wet-lab projects would be valuable for future cohorts. Conclusion: This report concludes that dry-lab project provision can be a suitable and equitable alternative for wet-lab projects. Dry-lab projects can be valuable for learning new skills and may be an attractive option for some students and supervisors who prefer to work outside the laboratory setting. A choice of both dry-lab and wet-lab projects is highly recommended as it provides more choice for students to tailor their final year experience to their individual circumstances, strengths and future career aspirations.",

We discuss on how far deep learning algorithms help in decision-making. We identify/address data collections, methodical contributions, promising methods, and challenges. However, a fair comparison is not trivial as dataset sizes vary over time, throughout the year 2020. Even though their unprecedented efforts in building AI-guided tools to detect, localize, and segment Covid-19 cases are limited to education and training, we elaborate on their strengths and possible weaknesses when we consider the need of cross-population train/test models.

    "abstract": "Bibliometrics is the discipline where quantitative methods were employed to probe the scientific communication process by measuring and analyzing various aspects of written documents. It helps to monitor the growth of literature and patterns of research. The present paper is based on the analysis of IP Indian Journal of Library Science and Information Technology (IJLSIT) with the help of bibliometrics parameters during the period 2016 to 2020. Among the several bibliometric parameters, the study utilizes mainly the number of articles per volume or year, authorship pattern, collaborative pattern, top-most authors, state-, designation-& affiliation-wise contribution, reference per article count, cited resources type, research trends and research interests. The research data of this study collected manually, analysed with the help of an MS Excel spreadsheet and distinguished according to different types of bibliometric elements. The findings of the study suggested that in IJLSIT, the maximum number of articles published in the year 2019 (25.74%), 53.47% (54) articles contributed by a single author, and the overall collaboration rate is 0.47. Furthermore, 90% (91) of articles contributed by Indian authors and Hemantha Kumar G.H. is the most productive author. Maharastra (18.81%) being the most contributed Indian state, Benue State University & Rayalaseema University (4.95%) being the most contributed institutions and College Librarians are the most designated contributors (20.79%). The study further revealed that 0-5 pages are the most common length, 6-10 references are the most common references used per article, and periodicals are the most commonly cited reference types. The area \u201cDigital Library\u201d is nurtured most among researchers, whereas, the year 2018, vol. 3, issue 1 consists of the maximum views number (18.01%) and the year 2020, vol. 5, issue 1 has the most number of downloads (22.92%). \n\nKeywords: Bibliometrics, Research Productivity, IP Indian Journal of",

    "title": "Older workers in the Baltic States over the pandemic year: share corona survey results",
    "abstract": "The study is based on the dataset collected within the framework of the Survey of Health, Ageing and \nRetirement (SHARE), namely in two subsequent SHARE Corona Surveys via computer-assisted telephone interviews: in June-August 2020 and in June-August 2021. The survey is targeted specifically at collecting data on the living situation of people who are 50 years and older during the pandemic across Europe. The objective of the research is to analyse the change observed in the respondents between 2020 and 2021, how the continuing Covid-19 crisis influenced their work and employment, their retirement decisions, and what kind of financial support and from what sources they received due to the pandemic. The situation in Latvia is examined against the background of the other Baltic States as well as other European countries. Despite the effects of the Covid-19, the levels of employment among the 50+ population remain high and do not demonstrate a trend to decline. A considerable share of the study population in Latvia received some kind of additional financial support from the government helping to mitigate the financial cost of the crisis. As concerns the changes in working time among those who remained in employment, for the absolute majority of the Baltic participants there were no changes compared to the situation one year before, as well as to the place of work. Recent developments in the labour legislation in Latvia related to the creating of the legal framework for remote work.",

    "abstract": "In order to support the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, DG Environment and the Joint Research Centre joined to carry out a study on the expected cumulative impact of existing EU environmental legislation on the quality of the marine environment, with specific reference to the case of aquatic discharges to the European seas. The report describes a few scenario analyses affecting emissions to the European regional seas up to 2020 for Lindane, Trifluralin and Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) taken as pilot substances. The scenarios developed are agreed with stakeholders at DG ENV following some preparatory meetings. The scenarios do not intend be exhaustive, but examples of what can be further achieved making use of the modelling and database development made in the different phases of the project. For Lindane, the model estimated European sea load of 745 tons per 1995, based on the official emission data provided by EMEP, appears to be reduced by 98.3% in 2005, ten years after the start of the EU regulations for \u03b3-HCH. Besides, under the BAU scenario, a Lindane sea load of ca.12.5 tons per year should be expected. The trend and ban scenarios support, respectively, a reduction of the load to the European seas in 2020 by 74% and 95% when compared to the BAU estimate. Aimed at Trifluralin, according to the BAU scenario, an annual load of ca.61.7 tones is estimated in 2020. However, this is an overestimation of sea load, because the aggregated emission data of EUROSTAT for the agriculture use of the entire group of dinitroaniline herbicides in for EU25 have been considered as model input data. The ban scenario forecasts ca. 0.07 t/y and in practice eliminates the concern about loads of Trifluralin to European seas to a negligible level due to degradation in soil. Considering PFOS under BAU scenario conditions the total sea load from all European countries is estimated to be 5.8 tons per year. The model forecasts approximately a half of this amount when a 50% reduction of emissions takes place.

    "abstract": "Several studies have empirically explored the association between practices in sustainable tourism and their impact on tourism marketing. However, bibliometric studies that organize the production in this field are still scarce. The objective of this study is thus to provide a bibliometric analysis of research on sustainable practices in tourism related to marketing, identifying the state of the art, trends and other indicators, by monitoring the articles published on the Web of Science (WoS) platform. A sample of 694 materials was obtained. The data were processed and the results graphically illustrated using the VOSviewer software. The study analyzed the simultaneous occurrence of publications by year, keyword trends, cocitations, bibliographic coupling and analysis of coauthorship, countries and institutions, and indicates that the literature on tourism sustainability issues in the field of tourism marketing is growing at a quick pace; merely five papers accounted for more than 2193 citations, but there are several prolific authors. Of the 694 sources included in the review, the most important ones published 40.34% of the papers; Spain is the leading country in this topic. This research provides insight about the state of the art and identifies gaps and research opportunities in sustainability and tourism marketing.",

    "abstract": ". This study aims to identify the experiences of information technology (IT) students in learning computer programming. Specifically, the feelings towards learning programming and the challenges and difficulties encountered by IT students were determined. The researcher used a phenomenological approach to determine the commonality of lived experiences among the students. The study was conducted during the second semester of Academic Year 2020\u20132021. The participants were first-year students enrolled in a computer programming I course. Open-ended questions were employed to gather responses. Since the data gathering happened during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, the researcher used Google Form to collect responses. Participants were informed that the responses gathered were treated with the utmost confidentiality, security, and anonymity, following ethical research guidelines. Results revealed that participants have both positive and negative views about learning programming. As to the feelings towards learning computer programming, analysis shows that positive emotions include excitement and good happy feelings towards writing programs and finding them fun, challenging, and engaging. Negative feelings include being nervous, anxious, confused, and having difficulty learning how to write programs because it is hard. The challenges and problems encountered by IT students include difficulties relating to the program's syntax, errors and debugging processes; lesson-related; algorithm, analysis, resources, teaching, time-management, and personal factors. The researcher suggests recommendations that would improve the quality of teaching computer programming and offer new possible topics for future studies.",

    "abstract": "The importance of biodiversity conservation is gradually being recognized worldwide, and 2020 was the final year of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets formulated at the 10th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP10) in 2010. Unfortunately, the majority of the targets were assessed as unachievable. While it is essential to measure public awareness of biodiversity when setting the post-2020 targets, it is also a difficult task to propose a method to do so. This study provides a diachronic exploration of the discourse on \u201cbiodiversity\u201d from 2010 to 2020, using Twitter posts, combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling, commonly used in data science. Through the aggregation and comparison of n-grams, the visualization of eight types of emotional tendencies using the NRC emotion lexicon and supplemental comparison with the machine learning model, the construction of topic models using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and the qualitative analysis of tweet texts based on these models, the analysis and classification of these unstructured tweets have been performed effectively. The results revealed the evolution of words used with \u201cbiodiversity\u201d on Twitter over the past decade, the emotional tendencies behind the contexts in which \u201cbiodiversity\u201d has been used, and the approximate content of tweet texts that have constituted topics with distinctive characteristics. While searching for people\u2019s awareness through SNS analysis still has many limitations, it is undeniable that essential suggestions can be obtained. To further refine the research method, it will be crucial to improve analysts\u2019 skills, accumulate research examples, and advance data science.",

    "title": "Introduction to the Special Section on PADS 2020",
    "abstract": "This special section highlights four articles extended from papers that appeared in the 2020 ACM Conference on Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation (SIGSIM-PADS). It has been a tradition that ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS) showcases some of the best papers from the SIGSIM flagship conference each year. This special section is edited by Philippe J. Giabbanelli and Christopher D. Carothers, who served as the conference program chairs and were responsible for the proceedings of the conference. Jason Liu was the general chair of the conference and helped with the initial organization of this special section. The articles appearing in this special section have also benefited from the help of Francesco Quaglia, who is the Editorin-Chief of ACM TOMACS, and assistance from the ACM publishing staff. The outcome of the selection process identified seven articles as possible candidates for this special section, as they were highly ranked based on reviews by the Technical Program Committee of SIGSIM-PADS 2020. Authors from each of the seven articles were invited to propose a substantial extension of their original conference papers to the editors of the special section. Accepted proposals were then given a deadline that allowed authors to perform the proposed work. To ensure quality, the extended manuscripts were peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. All of the articles in this special section have undergone multiple rounds of reviews, so authors had the opportunity to carefully address the suggestions by the reviewers. Based on this process, the special section finally consists of four articles. The first article, entitled \u201cMechanisms for Precise Virtual Time Advancement in Network Emulation,\u201d describes a new software modeling tool called Kronos that enables the precise instruction level tracking of process execution and control over the scheduling of containers. Kronos not only improves the mapping of runtime behaviors to the advancement of time but also enables the behavior of the emulation independent of the platform CPU resources that is hosting the emulation. This work demonstrates that Kronos is able to accurately control process execution at very small time-slices and in turn precisely model CPU instructions and traffic flows in large-scale networks. The original paper, from which this article is extended, won the 2020 SIGSIM-PADS Best Paper Award. The second article, entitled \u201cGenerating Fast Specialized Simulators for Stochastic Reaction Networks via Partial Evaluation,\u201d presents a novel rule-based, partial evaluation approach that generates a specialized model-specific algorithm that yields a high-performance biochemical reaction network simulation. In particular, the evaluation conducted by the authors demonstrates that a combination of profile-guided optimization and partial evaluation techniques yields an impressive 16\u00d7 performance improvement! The third article, entitled \u201cA Scalable Quantum Key Distribution Network Testbed Using Parallel Discrete-Event Simulation,\u201d explores the efficacy of using parallel simulation approaches for",

Visibility also determines the general world scientific community\u2019s picture (\u201cimage\u201d) and the domestic science in this area development level, which, to a certain extent, forms its scientific world prestige.\nThe article discusses the domestic publications in the field of science \u201cPhysics and Astronomy\u201d (according to SCOPUS data for 1980\u20132020) array\u2019s visibility dynamics development from this area specialist\u2019s point of view. This arrays dynamic\u2019s parameters are analyzed in terms of number of journals filling, the ratio of domestic and foreign journals, the number of publications on these components, their conditional \u201cquality\u201d, determined by these journals scientometric\u2019s characteristics (divided into quartiles). It is shown that the array of publications increased during this period from 878 to 17913 (20,4 times), but the number of the array journals increased only 7.2 times (from 102 to 730), due to a significant average publications number by one journal title per year increase from 8,7 to 24.6 (i.e. 2,8 times).It is determined that the array underwent significant changes in the period of the 80\u201390s of the last century and came to relative number of parameters 2000-s stabilization \u2013 the annual publications per journal title number, the percentage of foreign and domestic sources used (journals), as well as the distribution of publications balance between these groups of journals. This balance is near to a 50/50 ratio with a significantly larger share of array\u2019s foreign journals than domestic ones.The existence of a certain \u201ccore\u201d of journals was revealed, which, which includes less than 40% in terms of the number of journals, and includes from ~ 80% to 90% of all annual publications, that points journals should be attracted, first of all, to the attention of library and information specialists, ensuring the convenience of work users.The conditional \u201cquality\u201d of the \u201ccore\u201d journals array was assessed (according to the level of quartiles to which these journals are assigned, according to the SCOPUS database data for the corresponding years).

    "abstract": "\n COVID-19 has been an emerging and rapidly evolving risk to people of the world in 2020. Facing this dangerous situation, many colleagues in Neurorestoratology did their best to avoid infection if themselves and their patients, and continued their work in the research areas described in the 2020 Yearbook of Neurorestoratology. Neurorestorative achievements and progress during 2020 includes recent findings on the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, neurorestorative mechanisms and clinical therapeutic achievements. Therapeutic progress during this year included advances in cell therapies, neurostimulation/neuromodulation, brain-computer interface (BCI), and pharmaceutical neurorestorative therapies, which improved neurological functions and quality of life for patients. Four clinical guidelines or standards of Neurorestoratology were published in 2020. Milestone examples include: 1) a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of olfactory ensheathing cell treatment of chronic stroke showed functional improvements; 2) patients after transhumeral amputation experienced increased sensory acuity and had improved effectiveness in work and other activities of daily life using a prosthesis; 3) a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis used a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI to achieve accurate and speedy computer input; 4) a patient with complete chronic spinal cord injury recovered both motor function and touch sensation with a BCI and restored ability to detect objects by touch and several sensorimotor functions. We hope these achievements motivate and encourage other scientists and physicians to increase neurorestorative research and its therapeutic applications.\n",

    "abstract": "Rather than covering the well-trodden ground of this expedition specifically, Kaalund focuses instead on three expeditions outfitted to find the lost men, making some observations along the way. The discoveries of the men on these expeditions, including discoveries about the fate of Franklin, were closely tied to the reputations of the leaders. For instance, John Rae\u2019s infamous discovery that the crews of the Terror and the Erebus resorted to cannibalism was met with widespread derision, especially because it relied on Inuit testimony, but also because it ran contrary to the image of a British gentleman. This news was better received in Denmark since it did not tarnish a national hero. Finally, the fourth chapter addresses the evolution of Arctic science toward the end of the nineteenth century. In this chapter, Kaalund recounts the experience of Suersaq, or Hans Hendrick, a veteran of four British and American expeditions who subsequently wrote a memoir of his experiences, providing a rare voice from an indigenous explorer. Her account of the first International Polar Year (IPY) (1882\u20133) represents a shifting view of what constitutes necessary science in the Arctic. Rather than following the model of heroic expeditions, modelled especially by the British, the IPY parties established twelve polar stations in the Arctic Circle to gather meteorological and other geophysical observations. Topographic mapping was a secondary concern. Kaalund\u2019s book is short. Coming in at 176 pages, she does not spend an especially long time on any specific expedition. While this breadth is a strength, tying together several expeditions that are not usually thus connected, it is also a weakness; expeditions are discussed in minimal terms and require the reader to already be familiar with the history of Arctic exploration. Her focus on travel narratives generally centers the recognizable tropes of heroic white officers and men of science in polar exploration, but welcomely acknowledges the role of indigenous figures in the European accounts. Finally, the book\u2019s rich illustrations help the reader immerse themselves in its story. Overall, this book should be commended for its success in placing the genre of travel narratives directly within debates over the nature of polar science and environments. Additionally, while many have demonstrated the role of travel literature within imperial contexts, Kaalund extends this historiography to the Arctic. I can unabashedly recommend this work to scholars of empire, science, travel and the polar regions.",

    "abstract": "In this descriptive analysis, we consider the experiences of students who prefer face-to-face (F2F) classes but, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had no alternative other than taking their introductory biology class online during the 2020\u20132021 academic year. We conducted focus group interviews with 12 college students who enrolled in an asynchronous online introductory biology course for non-majors. We interpret their experiences through the theoretical framing of student engagement, which generally centers students as the directors of their learning experiences. However, when reflecting on their online, technologically mediated experience, our participants regarded their instructors as the hub or convener of their interactions with content, technology, and other learners. We explore the implications of these findings for engaging other students who may find themselves involuntarily online, and make recommendations for pedagogy and communication around the culture of online learning.",

    "title": "Engaging Black Female Students in a Year-Long Preparatory Experience for AP CS Principles",
    "abstract": "In 2020, over 116,000 students took the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) Exam. Although Black female students have participated in AP CSP at higher rates than for the AP CSA course, their representation is still disproportionately lower than the school population of Black females. In this Experience Report, we present the early results of an NSF-sponsored effort that provides an AP CSP preparatory experience and CS career awareness to Black female students from rural, urban, and suburban communities in the state of Alabama. At the project's core is a peer-learning community (PLC) facilitated by Black female teachers with deep knowledge of AP CSP. An intensive summer experience prepares students for the AP CSP course through culturally-responsive, project-based learning experiences designed to connect advanced computing concepts to the students' personal lives and career aspirations. Interactions and support continue throughout the academic year to facilitate AP exam readiness. Online interactions among the PLC members serve to mitigate the barriers that young women of color typically encounter when pursuing CS education, increasing their persistence and success in CS. We examined whether students' project participation enhances self-efficacy and perceived competency in CS, increases positive attitudes, awareness, and desire to pursue CS studies and careers, and mitigates perceived socio-cultural barriers to pursue studies and careers in CS. Our initial findings include AP CSP examination qualifying rates (87.5%) that numerically exceeded the 2020 national/statewide rates for all groups (i.e., based on race, gender, and their intersection), increased perceptions of Black females as belonging in CS, and gains in computing self-efficacy.",

    "title": "Applications of ambient ionization mass spectrometry in 2020: An annual review",
    "abstract": "Abstract Recent developments in mass spectrometry (MS) analyses have seen a concerted effort to reduce the complexity of analytical workflows through the simplification (or removal) of sample preparation and the shortening of run\u2010to\u2010run analysis times. Ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS) is an exemplar MS\u2010based technology that has swiftly developed into a popular and powerful tool in analytical science. This increase in interest and demonstrable applications is down to its capacity to enable the rapid analysis of a diverse range of samples, typically in their native state or following a minimalistic sample preparation approach. The field of AIMS is constantly improving and expanding, with developments of powerful and novel techniques, improvements to existing instrumentation, and exciting new applications added with each year that passes. This annual review provides an overview of applications of AIMS techniques over the past year (2020), with a particular focus on the application of AIMS in a number of key fields of research including biomedical sciences, forensics and security, food sciences, the environment, and chemical synthesis. Novel ambient ionization techniques are introduced, including picolitre pressure\u2010probe electrospray ionization and fiber spray ionization, in addition to modifications and improvements to existing techniques such as hand\u2010held devices for ease of use, and USB\u2010powered ion sources for on\u2010site analysis. In all, the information provided in this review supports the view that AIMS has become a leading approach in MS\u2010based analyses and that improvements to existing methods, alongside the development of novel approaches, will continue across the foreseeable future.",

    "abstract": "Critiquing arguments is important for K\u201012 science students to learn but not emphasized by the predominant claim\u2010evidence\u2010reasoning (CER) argumentation model. Drawing on the work of Yu and Zenker (2020), and Dove and Nussbaum (2018), we developed a tool for supplementing CER with critical questions (CQs) from philosophy that cover most, if not all, the logical dimensions of argument critique. Six middle school science teachers designed lessons involving argumentation, including the use of CQs. We assessed the effects on student self\u2010efficacy for engaging in argument critique, teacher self\u2010efficacy for using argument pedagogy, and teachers\u2019 perceptions of the value of CQs. Qualitative data included teacher interviews, lesson transcripts, and student work samples. Quantitative data included surveys of student self\u2010efficacy administered at the beginning and end of the school year. There was evidence suggesting an increase over time in students\u2019 confidence for engaging in argument critique and teachers\u2019 confidence with argument pedagogy. However, only four of the six teachers were confident and skilled enough to include CQs in their lessons. Those who did use CQs tended to perceive them as providing a helpful structure for critique, prompts for deeper thinking, and a tool for fostering critical classroom norms. Discussion of CQs may have benefitted students\u2019 writing by promoting peer critique and encouragement to elaborate. Overall, CQs afford students with a framework for judging argument strength. Scientific argumentation involving CQs provides a more contemporary philosophical basis for scientific argumentation than CER or the Toulmin model as it emphasizes the critical and dialogic nature of science.",

    "title": "Correction to: Optical variability of quasars with 20-year photometric light curves",
    "abstract": "We study the optical $gri$ photometric variability of a sample of 190 quasars within the SDSS Stripe 82 region that have long-term photometric coverage during $\\sim 1998-2020$ with SDSS, PanSTARRS-1, the Dark Energy Survey, and dedicated follow-up monitoring with Blanco 4m/DECam. With on average $\\sim 200$ nightly epochs per quasar per filter band, we improve the parameter constraints from a Damped Random Walk (DRW) model fit to the light curves over previous studies with 10-15 yr baselines and $\\lesssim 100$ epochs. We find that the average damping timescale $\\tau_{\\rm DRW}$ continues to rise with increased baseline, reaching a median value of $\\sim 750$ days ($g$ band) in the rest-frame of these quasars using the 20-yr light curves. Some quasars may have gradual, long-term trends in their light curves, suggesting that either the DRW fit requires very long baselines to converge, or that the underlying variability is more complex than a single DRW process for these quasars. Using a subset of quasars with better-constrained $\\tau_{\\rm DRW}$ (less than 20\\% of the baseline), we confirm a weak wavelength dependence of $\\tau_{\\rm DRW}\\propto \\lambda^{0.51\\pm0.20}$. We further quantify optical variability of these quasars over days to decades timescales using structure function (SF) and power spectrum density (PSD) analyses. The SF and PSD measurements qualitatively confirm the measured (hundreds of days) damping timescales from the DRW fits. However, the ensemble PSD is steeper than that of a DRW on timescales less than $\\sim$ a month for these luminous quasars, and this second break point correlates with the longer DRW damping timescale.",

    "title": "Tony Mercer, BSc, FICorr (21 November 1928-20 October 2020)",
    "abstract": "We have only recently heard of the death of Tony Mercer who was a former editor of Corrosion Engineering Science and Technology in its British Corrosion Journal (BCJ) days. Tony succeeded Hector Campbell in 1989 and continued for 8 years until his retirement, when Paul McIntyre took over. Tony spent his entire career at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) establishing an international reputation in corrosion inhibition and control particularly for engine coolant systems. He was born in Southwick, West Sussex, attended the nearby Steyning Grammar School and, after leaving in 1945 with the Higher School Certificate, was recruited as an assistant experimental officer in the then Chemical Research Laboratory which was adjacent to NPL on the Teddington site in west London. During the next few years, he obtained his BSc degree by part-time study and joined Frank Wormwell\u2019s team to work on inhibitors / anti-freeze mixtures for engine coolant systems leading to the award of a patent in 1952 [1]. The benzoate-nitrite inhibitor system (the basis of the patent) became an effective standard for automotive engine coolants and produced a welcome stream of royalties for some 20 years thereafter! Later work to determine the limits of operation of the mixture were published in several papers from 1952 [2]. Continuing his work with inhibitors, now with Brasher and Kingsbury, his attention was turned to the mechanism of chromate inhibition. By using Cr as a radiotracer, mass changes due to passivation of iron by chromate of around 100 nanograms per square centimetre were measured, an outstanding sensitivity for the time [3]. Tony worked on many problems of industrial relevance during his career, particularly assisting with and eventually heading up the National Corrosion Advisory Service set up after the 1971Hoar Report [4] on the costs of corrosion. However, his research returned time and again to corrosion inhibition and, in 4 consecutive papers with co-workers, he explored the comparative performance and mechanisms of different compounds [5]. He wrote an excellent review of the work on inhibitors within the Corrosion Section of the Division of Materials Applications at the NPL in 1973 [6]. After retirement his 1995 paper with Lumbard was a tourde-force describing more than 20 years of previous research at NPL on corrosion and corrosion prevention of mild steel in water [7] accordingly winning the 1997 Guy Bengough Award of the Institute of Metals. Tony was a passionate advocate of standardisation for corrosion measurement and testing and was variously a member of the BSI Committee on Corrosion of Metals and Alloys, the ISO Working Group on Corrosion Terminology, the UK National Council of Corrosion Societies, ASTM Corrosion Committee G1, and the Corrosion Committee of the Institute of Materials. He attended many conferences, particularly the inaugural conference on corrosion inhibition held at the University of Ferrara and subsequent quinquennial events. In 1980 he became Scientific Secretary of the European Federation of Corrosion (EFC) and initiated the EFC newsletter [8], publication of which continues to this day. For many years, he was also an active member on the EFC working party on inhibition and reported on methods for the standardisation of inhibitor testing in 1985 [9]. On retiring from the Corrosion Section of the Materials Application Division of the NPL in 1989 Tony Mercer succeeded Hector Campbell as 4th editor of the British Corrosion Journal [10]. During his tenure the journal celebrated its Silver Jubilee in 1990 with a series of specially commissioned articles and further developed its international reputation such that by 1996 when he retired from the editorship over 80% of contributions were from outside the UK [11]. The internationalisation of the submissions was reflected a few years\u2019 later by the adoption of our current name. He stepped down from the journal in 1996 to spend more time with his family at their home in Surrey. However, he remained active with the EFC editing a series of books and also contributing to the 3rd and 4th editions of the major reference work \u2018Shreir\u2019s Corrosion\u2019. In 1998 he was awarded the Mart\u00ed i Franqu\u00e8s Medal by the EFC on behalf of the Spanish Society of Industrial Chemistry in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of the science and technology of corrosion through international cooperation, transfer of knowledge, and education [12]. He had met Stella, his future wife, when a promotional film was being produced by the Chemical Research Laboratory on the benefits of adding anti-freeze to vehicle coolant. She was employed in the biology department and was coopted to do the voiceover: \u2018At the first sign of winter many motorists think of cracked radiators and cylinder blocks ... \u2019. Tony was a keen sportsman being active in the departmental cricket, hockey, and badminton teams. In the 1960s some of the best scientific work on inhibitors was being carried out in the USSR and China so, in his spare time, he learnt sufficient Russian and Mandarin Chinese in order to be able to read relevant papers in those languages. He was always interested in expanding his knowledge and Stella and he were greatly interested in antiquity. Thus, in retirement, they spent much time travelling around the Mediterranean on educational cruises and archaeological trips. He spent his final days in a care home in the Sussex village of Alfriston where he died of old age. Tony is survived byhiswidow, Stella, their daughterKatherine, and grandchildren: Ella (a solicitor), Eve (a journalist), Ewan (a student gap year), Emily (doing a sports degree)",

    "title": "Global, Regional, and National Lifetime Probabilities of Developing Cancer in 2020",
    "abstract": "Background: The lifetime risk of cancer is a measure of the cumulative impact of cancer across a defined age span, and has obvious intuitive appeal. There are however few examples of its systematic use in comparative assessments of cancer-specific risk across populations. We therefore sought to estimate and interpret the lifetime and age-conditional probabilities of developing cancer at the country, world region and global level in 2020. \n \nMethods: We obtained estimates of sex- and age-specific cancer incidence rates from GLOBOCAN for 185 countries for the year 2020, alongside all-cause mortality and population data from the United Nations. Countries were categorized into quartiles of the Human Development Index (HDI) as developed by the United Nations Development Programme. The lifetime risk of cancer was estimated using the adjusted for multiple primaries (AMP) method, taking into account competing risks of death from causes other than cancer as well as average life expectancy. \n \nFindings: In 2020, the estimated global lifetime risk of cancer from birth to death was 25.1% (26.3% in men and 24.0% in women) . There were marked differences in risks between countries within world regions and by level of human development. In very high HDI, high HDI, medium HDI and low HDI countries, the lifetime risk of cancer was 38.5%, 25.4%, 11.4%, and 10.3%, respectively, with cancer risks highest in Ireland (49.7%) and lowest in Central African Republic (6.6%). There was similar heterogeneity according to cancer type by sex. Worldwide, prostate cancer and breast cancer were associated with the greatest lifetime risks among men and women, of 4.6% and 5.9% respectively. The lifetime risk of cancer decreased by age, with a remaining risk of 12.6% from the age 70 years. \n \nInterpretation: In 2020, the global lifetime risk of cancer from birth to death translates approximately 1 in 4 persons developing cancer, with men and women having similar levels of lifetime risk. The identified age-specific variations in cancer risk at the population level can provide important information to support the targeted cancer prevention and health systems planning. \n \nFunding: National Key R&D Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Nova Program \n \nDeclaration of Interest: All authors declare no competing interests.",

    "title": "Developing and Using Computer Models to Understand Epidemics",
    "abstract": "Over the past year, educators have developed curricula teaching about the COVID-19 pandemic (Reed 2020, Royce 2020, Sadler et al. 2020). Many of these curricula feature computer simulations of epidemic dynamics (Kelter 2020, Sadler et al. 2020). Because an epidemic pattern is an emergent property of interacting human behaviors, it is crucial for students to recognize the mechanism of its emergence. This article describes an eight-day unit in which students develop their own epidemic simulations and use them to investigate how individual human behaviors and interactions give rise to the epidemic dynamics at the population level. NetLogo (Wilensky 1999), a beginner-friendly, agent-based computer modeling tool, is used to empower students to design and modify their simulations. They collect data, identify patterns, and use mathematical and computational thinking to understand infectious disease spread and control.",

    "abstract": "The Global Justice Index is a multiyear research project conducted at the Fudan-IAS to conceptualize and measure each country\u2019s contribution to achieving greater global justice. In 2019, we completed our research project on first-year achievements, with the rankings of nation-states at the global level based on data from 2010 to 2017. This was published titled the \u201cGlobal Justice Index Report\u201d in Chinese Political Science Review (Vol. 5, No. 3, 2020). The \u201cGlobal Justice Index Report 2020\u201d is the second annual report based on our work analyzing data from 2010 to 2018, which was concluded in 2020. In order to better measure each country\u2019s performance and contribution to achieving greater global justice, compared to the first edition published in 2020, we have improved the model, added the refugee issue to expand the issue areas to 10, and added new indicators, regional analysis and comparison in this report. The report comprises five main sections. In the introduction, we discuss the development of the conceptual framework and evaluative principles to justify our selection of dimensions and indicators for measurement. Next, in the section of methodology, we discuss the production, normalization, and aggregation of the raw data and the generation of the final results. In the findings section, we report the data, indicators and our results for the ten issues, and provide regional comparisons. And then, in the following section we present the main results, and report the ranking of each country\u2019s contribution to achieving greater global justice. In the final section, we discuss the applications and limitations of the index, and its potential further research trajectories.",

[Participants and Methods] The participants were 202 males and 158 females who graduated from the International University of Health and Welfare, in March from 2017 to 2020. The levels of satisfaction with initiatives toward the national examination of the physical therapy and satisfaction with experiences were assessed using a visual analog scale. The participants were ranked into four 25th percentile groups based on the visual analog scale score of satisfaction with initiatives toward the national examination of the physical therapy. [Results] There was a significant difference in the level of satisfaction with activities for job hunting and mock test scores of the national examination in both males and females, graduation research in males, and own effort for computer-based testing in females. [Conclusion] It is suggested that the degree of satisfaction with initiatives toward the national examination of the physical therapy is related to the level of satisfaction with student life activities and that there are gender differences in this relationship.",

    "abstract": "\n On 9 February 2020 at 11:03 pm EST, an Atlas V 411 rocket launched the ESA/ NASA Solar Orbiter mission. This mission was the culmination of decades of work across many countries to achieve the goal of getting close to the Sun and measuring how the Sun creates and maintains the heliosphere. The mission\u2019s goal is to understand how the inner heliosphere works and how solar activity impacts it. The spacecraft achieves this with a specially designed highly elliptical orbit that gets close to the Sun twice a year. It reaches as close as 0.28 au requiring a novel heat shield to protect the instruments from the intense heat (the front side of the heat shield reaches around 500 \u2218C at this location). There are ten scientific instruments onboard: Six remote-sensing instruments observe solar activity across the electromagnetic spectrum on small and large scales, including imaging the source regions of the solar wind. They are accompanied by four in-situ instruments to probe the properties of the solar wind as it flows past the spacecraft. This review paper describes a selection of results from Solar Orbiter during its cruise phase and the beginning of its nominal scientific operations phase, and looks towards the next phases of the mission, when the spacecraft leaves the ecliptic plane to observe the solar poles for the first time.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to examine the perceptions of pre-service science teachers regarding technological disasters, including oil tanker accidents, nuclear accidents, fires, fuel-related poisoning, and space accidents. Additionally, efforts have indeed been made to investigate the sources from which teacher candidates acquire the foundational knowledge shaping their perceptions. The study was conducted using a case study design. Data for the study were collected during the spring semester of the 2020\u20132021 academic year. The study was conducted with 80 pre-service science teachers enrolled in various years of the Science Education Department across four universities in Turkey. The data for the study were obtained through a drawing test. Thematic content analysis was used in the analysis of the data. Based on the findings of the study, it can be concluded that pre-service science teachers often confuse technological disasters with natural disasters and may hold non-scientific explanations regarding technological disasters. Additionally, they tend to describe technological disasters primarily in terms of their causes and consequences. In addition, it can be stated that pre-service science teachers\u2019 perceptions of technological disasters are significantly influenced by information obtained from mass media. It is recommended that pre-service science teachers should be given training about technological disasters, incorporating the effective use of mass media as part of these training sessions.",

    "title": "Reoccurring science identities:",
    "abstract": "This paper examines Swedish secondary students\u2019 interest in science and technology from a gender perspective in a comparative research design using quantitative data collected 2003 and 2020. National data has been collected from 610 15-year-old students in 2020 as part of a large-scale comparative research project, the Relevance of Science Education - Second (ROSES) and compared with data from the Relevance of Science Education (ROSE) study from 2003. The results empirically update the research field and show a reoccurring interest pattern with minor changes. Content related to space and unexplained phenomena are still ranked as interesting to learn about. Girls are interested in health issues and the human body, space, dreams and the human soul. Boys favour items about space, inventions and discoveries together with ABC weapons. Minor developments are that interest in learning about diets and exercise as well as technology has declined. The least interesting things to learn are almost the same as in 2003, with several topics connected to the national science curriculum. The character of students\u2019 interest in S&T is framed and discussed using the theoretical approach of science identity. The stable character with minor changes is discussed as reoccurring science identities interpreted by the differentiation hypothesis of the \u201cperson-object theory of interest\u201d. Gender differences are interpreted as collective identities shown to be \u2018domain specific\u2019 not \u2018subject specific\u2019 and the content level of analysis provide specificity to \u2018interest patterns\u2019 which has not been well described earlier in the research literature. Research consequences of this conceptualization and implications for school practice is critically discussed. A research implication from this conceptualization is the importance for future studies to investigate varieties of collective identities.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the robotics industry celebrated its 60-year anniversary. We have used robots for more than six decades to empower people to do things that are typically dirty, dull and/or dangerous. The industry has progressed significantly over the period from basic mechanical assist systems to fully autonomous cars, environmental monitoring and exploration of outer space. We have seen tremendous adoption of IT technology in our daily lives for a diverse set of support tasks. Through use of robots we are starting to see a new revolution, as we not only will have IT support from tablets, phones, computers but also systems that can physically interact with the world and assist with daily tasks, work, and leisure activities. The present document is a summary of the main societal opportunities identified, the associated challenges to deliver desired solutions and a presentation of efforts to be undertaken to ensure that US will continue to be a leader in robotics both in terms of research innovation, adoption of the latest technology, and adoption of appropriate policy frameworks that ensure that the technology is utilized in a responsible fashion.

    "abstract": "The regular full research-savvy computer-scientific theoretical and applied papers of original nature, not printed elsewhere, subject to peer-review, and of innovative nature to add to the existing state of knowledge on various past and current pandemics were received throughout the entirety of the year 2021, such as the still-risky COVID-19 [1, 2], including the Advancement of Hospital/Healthcare Information Sciences & Networking [3]. Also, currently, Incurable Killer Diseases including the physical and neurological diseases of our times such as Brain, and Breast, and Lung Cancer [4\u20136] and Cardiovascular [7, 8], Asthma, HIV/AIDS, Dementia (e.g. Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, Huntingdon\u2019s and Vascular etc.), MS (Multiple Sclerosis), MD (Muscular Dystrophy), Motor Neuron Disorders such as ALS (Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease) to name a few among others, were of primary interest. These diseases\u2019 cures as of yet non-existent, however, are still meticulously being sought by the world\u2019s prominent institutes of epidemiologic and vaccination research centers such as CDC in USA. The goal of this Special Issue was what the ongoing global trends are, why and how to avoid the unprecedented misery triggered by diseases and disorders, and specifically, the current pandemics (SARS-CoV-2). The IJCTE has also fully encouraged scientific methodologies (via software) and technologies (via hardware) in the realm of medicinal sciences, and received original contributions such as Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Bacteriology, Genomics, Pulmonology, and Obstetrics [9], Clinical Psychology, Applied Mathematical and Statistical Sciences (Operations Research, Data Mining, Sampling, Hypothesis Testing, Estimation, Empirical Bayesian, Safety and Reliability, Game Theoretic and Neural Network and Machine and Deep Learning frameworks...) and Immunology and similar, whereas also in peripheral real disciplines addressing the core issue of Pandemics\u2019 and Incurable Killer Diseases\u2019 Disaster Recognition, Mobilization and Remediation and Immunization, and post COVID-19 Recalibration efforts [10] but not limited to all above options. Overall, the academic interest and eagerness toward this noble and global goal (while a relentless challenge has been announced by all nations during their SOTU-State of the Union and similar addresses at their own lands proper towards discovering vaccines to eradicate these disastrous pandemics and incurable killer diseases by the middle of the 21 century) have been phenomenal. Out of many more competing papers submitted, the below listed ten contributions were peer-reviewed following countless hours of selfless efforts by scientists of all calibers, to whom the IJCTE Editorial Board and the Editors-in-Chief owe many thanks. Last but not the least, those contributions, not able to make the finish line, not necessarily were inadequate. However, due to the physical and digital space and time limitations, and the announced/extended deadline restrictions, they may not have been broken to print to the IJCTE\u2019s regret. We sincerely encourage those authors to keep their academic attitude-defines-altitude motto for a future Special Issue to arrive shortly after a surprisingly original and calamitous pandemic has struck the globe in the year 2020. The Editors-in-Chief profusely appreciate the IJCTE Exec. Comm. as well as the Editorial Board and anonymous selfless peer-reviewers from A to Z for staging a quality performance.",

The version 9 (v9) Atmospheric Carbon Observations from Space (ACOS) Level 2 Full Physics (L2FP) retrieval algorithm (Kiel et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019) was used to derive estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) dry air mole fraction (XCO2) from the TANSO-FTS measurements collected over its first 11 years of operation. The bias correction and quality filtering of the L2FP XCO2 product were evaluated using estimates derived from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) as well as values simulated from a suite of global atmospheric inversion systems (models) which do not assimilate satellite-derived CO2. In addition, the v9 ACOS GOSAT XCO2 results were compared with collocated XCO2 estimates derived from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), using the version 10 (v10) ACOS L2FP algorithm. These tests indicate that the v9 ACOS GOSAT XCO2 product has improved throughput, scatter, and bias, when compared to the earlier v7.3 ACOS GOSAT product, which extended through mid 2016. Of the 37 million soundings collected by GOSAT through June 2020, approximately 20\u2009% were selected for processing by the v9 L2FP algorithm after screening for clouds and other artifacts. After post-processing, 5.4\u2009% of the soundings (2\u00d7106 out of 37\u00d7106) were assigned a \u201cgood\u201d XCO2 quality flag, as compared to 3.9\u2009% in v7.3 (<1\u2009\u00d7106 out of 24\u00d7106). After quality filtering and bias correction, the differences in XCO2 between ACOS GOSAT v9 and both TCCON and models have a scatter (1\u03c3) of approximately 1\u2009ppm for ocean-glint observations and 1 to 1.5\u2009ppm for land observations. Global mean biases against TCCON and models are less than approximately 0.2\u2009ppm. Seasonal mean biases relative to the v10 OCO-2 XCO2 product are of the order of 0.1\u2009ppm for observations over land. However, for ocean-glint observations, seasonal mean biases relative to OCO-2 range from 0.2 to 0.6\u2009ppm, with substantial variation in time and latitude. The ACOS GOSAT v9 XCO2 data are available on the NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES-DISC)\nin both the per-orbit full format\n(https://doi.org/10.5067/OSGTIL9OV0PN, OCO-2 Science Team et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019b)\nand in the per-day lite format\n(https://doi.org/10.5067/VWSABTO7ZII4, OCO-2 Science Team et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019a).\nIn addition, a new set of monthly super-lite files, containing only the most essential variables for each satellite observation, has been generated to provide entry level users with a light-weight satellite product for initial exploration (CaltechDATA, https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.2178, Eldering,\u00a02021).\nThe v9 ACOS Data User's Guide (DUG) describes best-use practices for the GOSAT data (O'Dell et\u00a0al.,\u00a02020). The GOSAT v9 data set should be especially useful for studies of carbon cycle phenomena that span a full decade or more and may serve as a useful complement to the shorter OCO-2 v10 data set, which begins in September 2014.\n",

    "abstract": "Mathematics teachers\u2019 perceptions and awareness of different kinds of assessments (e.g., diagnostic, formative, and summative assessments) may affect their classroom practices. In this context, the current study explored mathematics teachers\u2019 perceptions and self-reported practices teaching mathematics for Trends of International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in Abu Dhabi schools in the United Arab Emirates. A teacher perception questionnaire was designed, then was administered to 522 mathematics teachers in Abu Dhabi schools in the academic year 2020\u20132021. A One-Sample t-test, Independent Sample t-test, and ANOVA tests were performed for the four-component variables of teacher perceptions, namely, teachers\u2019 perceptions of TIMSS, their instructional practices in relation to TIMSS, the readiness of students for TIMSS, and the school and classroom environment for TIMSS. The results showed no statistically significant difference between male and female teachers in mathematics teaching practices with a focus on TIMSS or their perceptions of student readiness for TIMSS; however, there were differences in their perceptions of the school and classroom environment that were statistically significantly. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference between public and private schools in the practice of mathematics teachers for TIMSS, while the difference was statistically significant on views regarding student readiness for the TIMSS as well as on the school and classroom environment. The findings of the present study have both pedagogical and policy implications, which are discussed at the end of this paper.",

    "abstract": "In early 2020, the Covid\u201019 crisis forced medical institutions worldwide to convert quickly to online platforms for content delivery. Although many components of medical education were adaptable to that format, anatomical dissection laboratory lost substantial content in that conversion, including features of active student participation, three\u2010dimensional spatial relationships of structures, and the perception of texture, variation, and scale. The present study aimed to develop and assess online anatomy laboratory sessions that sought to preserve benefits of the dissection experience for first\u2010year medical students. The online teaching package was based on a novel form of active videography that emulates eye movement patterns that occur during processes of visual identification, scene analysis, and learning. Using this video\u2010image library of dissected materials, content was presented through asynchronous narrated laboratory demonstrations and synchronous/active video conference sessions and included a novel, video\u2010based assessment tool. Data were obtained using summative assessments and a final course evaluation. Test scores for the online practical examination were significantly improved over those for previous in\u2010person dissection\u2010based examinations, as evidenced by several measures of performance (Mean: 2015\u20132019: 82.5%; 2020: 94.9%; P = 0.003). Concurrently, didactic test scores were slightly, but not significantly, improved (Mean: 2015\u20132019: 88.0%; 2020: 89.9%). Student evaluations of online sessions and overall course were highly positive. Results indicated that this innovative online teaching package can provide an effective alternative when in\u2010person dissection laboratory is unavailable. Although this approach consumed considerable faculty time for video editing, further development will include video conference breakout rooms to emulate dissection small\u2010group teamwork.",

    "abstract": "The world recently witnessed the unexpected emergence of a coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic and severely impacted all aspects of human life. The sudden lockdown that came with the announcement of the pandemic affected health systems, the world economy and, inevitably, education systems across the globe. Due to the pandemic, schools and universities were closed, face-to-face education was suspended and a shift to emergency online teaching was instituted. English language training took its share in this transition and several studies were conducted to investigate the effects of the pandemic on emergency online teaching and the learning of English. This integrative literature review study analyses and synthesizes the research studies conducted between March 2020 and February 2021 to illustrate the first year of the pandemic in terms of English language teaching and learning globally. Thus, 69 research studies were selected for analysis. Findings show that the emergency online teaching and learning of English mainly created challenges due to the internet connection problems and students' access to computer or smart phones. On the other hand, contributing the teachers' digital literacy skills, the significance of online teaching and learning in case of emergency situations was highlighted as the findings showed. The studies produced conflicting results in terms of the implementation of emergency online teaching and learning practices, English language teachers and students' perceptions and attitudes, the affective, motivational and cognitive aspects, and the impact of emergency online teaching on the language development of students.",

    "abstract": "Background: As the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused widespread panic in the general public, it is essential to understand how public sentiment has changed.Methods: In the current study, we continuously tracked online public sentiment through the year 2020 by analyzing emotion reflected on 64,723,242 posts across China\u2019s largest social media platform Sina Weibo.Findings: We found that the pandemic not only affected online public sentiment in the initial outbreak but also induced long-term negative effects even in the aftermath of the successful recovery from the pandemic. The long-term negative effect was not due to the pandemic\u2019s severity either locally or globally, or even the post-pandemic economic recession. Rather, we speculate that the long-term negative effects may have resulted from the prolonged emotional trauma associated with the COVID-19 outbreak.Interpretation: COVID-19 induces long-term negative effects of public sentiments even in the aftermath of the successful recovery from the pandemic. It reminds public health and government administrators of the need to pay heed to public mental health even once the pandemic has concluded.Funding Statement: The Hunan Key Research and Development Project Grant (No. 2020SK2094), the National Key Technologies R&D Program of China Grant (No. 2015BAH22F01), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grants (No. 31771209).Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interest.Ethics Approval Statement: The study was approved by the ethics committee of Hunan University and East China Normal University.",

    "abstract": "Urinary tract infection is the most common bacterial infection in Bangladesh and a common disease of women than men. An antimicrobial agent is used for the treatment of UTI. The increase in antibiotic resistance among uropathogens is a global problem. This study attempted to underline the prevalence of UTI patients affected by uropathogenic strains. The study was conducted among 3060 patients of different ages and sex from over a period of one year April 2020 to April 2021 through conventional cultural, biochemical methods as well as disk diffusion methods to determine the uropathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. Among 3060 samples, 1148 (37.5%) samples were found culture positive, 248 (22%) cases positive for male & 900 (78%) cases positive for females. Most of the UTI was caused by Escherichia coli 891 (60 %). Moreover Enterobacter spp (7.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), Proteus vulgaris (3.5%), Proteus mirabilis (2.5 %) Citrobacter freundii (1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Staphylococcus spp (9.5%) Enterococcus faecalis (2%). 17 antibiotics were used against the isolated uropathogens. As it can be seen from (Table 2) Escherichia coli are sensitive to Meropenem 89%, Amikacin 80%, Gentamicin 74%, Nitrofuration 67%, Amoxiclave 71%, Ciprofloxacin 41%, Levofloxacin 37%, Doxycycline 40%.

    "title": "11039 Indiana CTSI High-School STEM Summer Research Program: Future opportunities from a 2020 virtual program",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT IMPACT: o The Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute K-12 STEM Outreach Program\u2019s pivoted to a virtual program in summer 2020 which yielded novel approaches that could be retained in future years to extend the reach/impact of our pipeline program. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: o Provide students with a meaningful and safe research experience during the COVID Pandemic. o Develop new modules and approaches that could be delivered virtually. o Engage students from communities that were not possible in previous years when in person meetings were required. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: o The program has historically supported over 100 high school students per year in a summer research internship for the last 5 years. Students are placed with academic research mentors in various Schools and Departments across the IUPUI campus, and also with industry laboratories. o COVID-related restrictions required development of 100% virtual program. Key aspects of the virtual program included: cohort-based research mentor assignments with 1-4 mentees matched per research mentor, research projects that could be conducted virtually, heavy engagement of high-school teachers to facilitate the research experience with cohorts of mentees, a more rigorous virtual seminar series that included new modules such as COVID-specific programming and thus enhancing public education about COVID. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: o The program served 130 students in summer 2020. o We were able to recruit new faculty and industry mentors involved in data science research. As a result, we have now increased our mentor pool to serve more students in the future. o Because student participation was virtual, we were able to accept students from further distances (up to 120 miles away) across the state. We were also able to accept local economically disadvantaged students that may have not been able to participate because of lack of reliable transportation. o A positive unanticipated outcome was that mentees relationships with the mentors was established virtually thus increasing the potential for students to remain engaged in their research. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: o Adapting to a virtual platform provided research experience to high school students during a time when traditional approaches were not possible. Given some research experiences do not require in-person activities, this newly established model could be used moving forward to allow more statewide engagement in research experiences.",

    "title": "Changes in Prevalence Patterns of Allergen Sensitization During the COVID-19 Pandemic in South China: A Cross-Sectional Study from 2017 to 2020",
    "abstract": "Background: Public health measures during COVID-19 have led to an unprecedented change in social lifestyle which might have an impact on the allergen sensitization in population. We sought to explore the prevalence patterns of serum allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) sensitization and serum total immunoglobulin E (tIgE) level among patients with clinical symptoms of suspected allergic diseases before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in south China. Methods: We assessed cross-sectional datasets from the First Affiliated Hospital of the Guangzhou Medical University from 2017 to 2020. Data on clinical symptoms of the patients with suspected allergic diseases in the hospital were collected and data from February to June in each year were extracted. Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to test statistical significance among years. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the magnitudes of the differences among years. Findings: The number of hospital visits for patients with suspected allergy symptoms decreased compared with previous years during COVID-19. For inhalant allergens, there was a statistically significant difference (P<0\u00b705) in the positive rate in 2020 compared with 2017, while no significant differences were found when comparing 2018 and 2019 with 2017, respectively. The odds of sIgE positives in inhalant allergens for 2017 and 2020 were all larger than 1\u00b700, with 1\u00b757 (P<0\u00b7001) for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, 1\u00b743 (P=0\u00b7024) for Dermatophagoides farina, 1\u00b750 (P<0\u00b7001) for German cockroach and 2\u00b700 (P=0\u00b7004) for dog dander, respectively. No significant difference was found in the prevalence change of food allergens in four years. For the positive rate of tIgE, a significant difference was found for the year 2017 and 2020 with the odds of 1\u00b727 (P<0\u00b7001). When comparing 2020 with 2017, there was a statistically significant difference (P<0\u00b7001) in the positive rate of inhalant allergens and tIgE in male population and female population. The positive rate of serum sIgE of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and tIgE were statistically different (P<0\u00b7001) in each age group. The positive rate of serum sIgE of German cockroach allergen was statistically different (P<0\u00b7001) in the adult group, and the positive rate of serum sIgE of dog dander allergen was statistically different (P<0\u00b7001) between the school-age children group and the adult group. Interpretation: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the positive rate of inhalant allergens and tIgE level increased while the positive rate of food allergens remained stable. Staying at home for a long time without frequent ventilation, insufficient sunshine or storing food at home might contribute to the result. Funding: The Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR and the National Natural Science Foundation of China.Declaration of Interests: We declare no competing interest exists. Ethics Approval Statement: The study was approved by the ethic committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (Reference number: GYFYY-2016-73) of Guangzhou Medical University. Written informed consent was obtained from all adults and legal guardians of the participating children.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose This article aims to determine the percentage of \u201cSparking\u201d articles among the work of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize winners in medicine, physics, and chemistry. Design/methodology/approach We focus on under-cited influential research among the key publications as mentioned by the Nobel Prize Committee for the 2020 Noble Prize laureates. Specifically, we extracted data from the Web of Science, and calculated the Sparking Indices using the formulas as proposed by Hu and Rousseau in 2016 and 2017. In addition, we identified another type of igniting articles based on the notion in 2017. Findings In the fields of medicine and physics, the proportions of articles with sparking characteristics share 78.571% and 68.75% respectively, yet, in chemistry 90% articles characterized by \u201cigniting\u201d. Moreover, the two types of articles share more than 93% in the work of the Nobel Prize included in this study. Research limitations Our research did not cover the impact of topic, socio-political, and author\u2019s reputation on the Sparking Indices. Practical implications Our study shows that the Sparking Indices truly reflect influence of the best research work, so it can be used to detect under-cited influential articles, as well as identifying fundamental work. Originality/value Our findings suggest that the Sparking Indices have good applicability for research evaluation.",

    "title": "Integration of Virtual Laboratories in eLearning: Enhancing Science Education amidst COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "abstract": "It is evident that education must continue despite the health crisis that the success of virtual laboratories during the new normal education presents a significant challenge for both instructors and students. The study determined the experiences of eight Bachelor of Secondary Education major in Science students of the Bukidnon State University, College of Education, in virtual laboratory activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic during the academic year 2020-2021. Since the focus of this qualitative action research is on learners' experiences in science-related activities, Husserl's descriptive phenomenological research approach was employed. The open-ended questions were taken from Reece's (2015) study and adjusted accordingly. Interviews were conducted using an online platform to gather data. To draw conclusions about the learning experiences that the students had while participating in the virtual laboratory, the researchers used qualitative descriptions that made use of themes and frames to examine the students' responses. Six overarching themes emerged from the data, including learner autonomy, the need for preparation for lab activities, evidence of student learning, presentation, teamwork, and a desire to learn science. Furthermore, a virtual laboratory saves money and time for both teachers and students while also being safe and offering an alternate place. It gives students a ton of opportunities to explore online simulations. To bridge the learning gaps left by the pandemic and create a suitable learning environment for students, virtual laboratory integration is a calculated approach. As a result, it provides a positive and adaptable learning environment that helped students understand the significance of science and technology and how crucial it is to create a safer community.",

    "abstract": "The student transition from high school to university is a complex process in which various factors operate. One of these factors is the degree of the students\u2019 academic preparation in certain subjects. This article analyzes the impact of this factor on the students\u2019 success in the first year of university studies, in the conditions when the subject program in high school has been reformed. This impact on the students\u2019 success, which is expressed both in the degree of academic preparation and in the students\u2019 attitude in the relevant subject, has been assessed employing statistical analysis. The analysis covers a period of 3 years (2017-2020), and is based on a sample of first year students of the Bachelor degree in Biology. The results of the questionnaire, conducted with first year university students, show the impact of their high school academic preparation on the success they have in the first year of university. This success is measured by assessing the change in average grade and their pass rates. Evidence of the impact of this factor in teaching has helped to know in detail these intermediate phases of this process. The built model makes it possible to analyze the impact of the high school curriculum reform on the students\u2019 success, creating the opportunity for further improvements. Despite the fact that the object of the study is the Biology curriculum and the evaluation of the impact in academic success of students who graduated from high schools where a competence based curriculum was implemented, this methodology can be used for the study in other subjects, especially life sciences.",

    "title": "A Bibliometric Analysis of Nano Metal-Organic Frameworks Synthesis Research in Medical Science Using VOSviewer",
    "abstract": "Nano MOFs (nMOFs) have now evolved as a new class of MOF with exciting applications. The purpose of this research is to perform bibliometric analysis on nMOFs for medical science by combining mapping analysis using VOSviewer software. Application reference manager used to obtain research data. The data obtained is the result of a search based on the keyword \"nano metal-organic framework and madical science\". From the search results, 1000 relevant published articles were found in the range of 2017-2021. The results showed that research on nano metal-organic frameworks and medical science has increased in 2017-2020, but it decreases since 2021. The main reason for the increase is the need for human health which continues to increase along with the emergence of new diseases. Although the increase should continue to occur every year, the decline in 2021 is due to social restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, thus limiting the work space in the field of research. This study shows the importance of bibliometric analysis in providing analytical data about what phenomena occur. This research is expected to help and become a reference for researchers in conducting and determining the research theme to be taken.",

    "title": "Risk Factors for Mortality Among Mid-Aged and Older Chinese: A Prospective Cohort Study Using 9-Year Follow-Up of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study",
    "abstract": "Background: To our knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of risk factors for mortality among mid-aged and older people in China based on a large nationally representative population study over an extended period has not yet been carried out. We investigated risk factors for mortality in the China Health and Retirement Study over 9 years. We aimed to investigate the associations between socioeconomic, demographic, psychosocial, behavioral, and health-related factors and all-cause mortality. \n \nMethods: Participants aged 45 and older were enrolled in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from July 2011 to March 2012 following a multi-stage stratified sampling procedure to ensure national representativeness. The lower age limit of 45 was chosen so that CHARLS could evaluate the ageing process well before people become eligible for retirement Participants are followed up regularly, with the most recent assessments in 2020. The study is multi-disciplinary, including a wide-ranging set of 32 measures of health, health behavior, demographics, and socioeconomics. We used Cox proportional hazard modeling to study the independent and joint contribution of risk factors to 9-year all-cause mortality. \n \nFindings: Some 17,708 participants were included in the baseline sample; 586 were lost to follow-up, and we excluded 459 aged under 45 at the baseline, 24 whose dates of death were unknown, and 12 with missing marital status, education, or household registration status. Of the 16,627 (51.6% were women) included in this study, 2,352 (41.5% were women) died during a median follow-up of 4.9 years (IQR 2.67-6.83). In fully adjusted models, the following factors were independent risk factors for mortality: age (HR=13 .44 for 75+ relative to aged 45-49), male sex (HR=1.60), widowed or never married (HR=1.45), low education (HR=1.50 for illiterate relative to high school or above), below-median household per capita expenditure (HR=1.14), current (HR=1.32) and past smoking (HR=1.37), poor self-rated health (HR=1.48 relative to good health), any difficulty in basic activities of daily living (HR=1.26) or instrumental activities of daily living (HR=1.35), chronic lung disease (HR=1.22), hypertension (HR=1.34), diabetes (HR=1.37) and chronic kidney disease (HR=1.38), underweight (HR=1.45), all at the significance level of p<0.01. Doctor-diagnosed cancer (HR=1.61), asthma (HR=1.19), and general cognitive impairment (HR=1.16) were significant at p<0.05. The sex-stratified analysis indicated that doctor-diagnosed cancer was not significant for women and strengthened for men (HR=2.16, p<0.05), and that past smoking was a leading risk factor for men (HR=1.41, p<0.01) but not for women. When we excluded individuals with serious illness at baseline, the association with past smoking increased in magnitude (HR=1.55, p<0.01). \n \nInterpretation: Mortality in China is multi-faceted, and risk factors include demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, psychosocial, and health factors. An integrated analysis of risk factors is more useful for policy-making than analyses of separate factors that can inflate the magnitude of associations. To further reduce mortality, China should increase access to quality health care services, improve the prevention, diagnosis and management of chronic diseases, continue to invest in education, occupational health and healthier home environments, and devote more efforts to tobacco control and ensure adequate nutrition among older people. \n \nFunding Information: National Institute on Aging, the Natural Science Foundation of China, the China Medical Board, the World Bank, and Peking University. \n \nDeclaration of Interests: We declare no competing interests. \n \nEthics Approval Statement: The study protocol was approved by the ethical review committee (IRB) of Peking University. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Ethics approval for the data collection in CHARLS was obtained from the Biomedical Ethics Review Committee of Peking University (IRB00001052\u201311015 for biomarkers and IRB00001052\u201311014 for the survey).",

    "abstract": "The effect of online argumentation and reflective thinking-based science teaching on sixth-grade students\u2019 epistemic cognition, metacognition, and logical thinking was explored in this study. The research was carried out in the 2020-2021 academic year when all teaching was online due to Covid-19. Students in the study sample were mostly from middle-class families. Students were divided into two groups for one semester; one received online argumentation and reflective thinking-based science teaching (experimental group) whereas the other received only online science teaching (control group). The exploratory factor analyses yielded two factors for epistemic cognition and metacognition questionnaires whereas the logical thinking test was found to be unidimensional. According to the results, experimental group students scored higher than control group students in post-test regulation of cognition and logical thinking. In addition, the experimental group developed knowledge of cognition, regulation of cognition, and logical thinking during the intervention. Although the experimental group scored higher than the control group on the set of post-test epistemic cognition factors, this significance did not appear amongst individual factors. As for the implications of this study, elements of distance learning that may have contributed to the development of students\u2019 cognitive abilities were discussed. \nKeywords: argumentation-based teaching, distance learning, epistemic cognition, logical thinking, reflective thinking",

    "abstract": "Science education in primary school is critical for establishing a comprehensive understanding of the nature of science. Students with positive attitudes towards science courses are more likely to achieve academic success. Measuring and fostering positive attitudes is essential for effective instructional planning. This study aimed to develop a measurable scale to assess the attitudes of fourth-grade elementary school students in Northern Cyprus towards Science and Technology Courses (STC). While developing the Student Science and Technology Attitude Scale (SSTAS), the literature was reviewed, and 168 students were asked to write essays about STC. A pool of attitude items was created by analyzing the literature and essays, and expert opinions were sought. The preliminary scale was prepared based on expert consultation. The study group included 651 randomly selected fourth-grade students during the 2020-2021 academic year. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were conducted to determine SSTAS's construct validity. The results indicated that the scale is valid and reliable, comprising three dimensions. The first dimension measures students' attitudes towards the teaching process, with 13 items. The second dimension assesses students' negative attitudes, including five items. The third dimension evaluates students' attitudes towards experiments, containing five items.\nKeywords: science and technology lesson, attitude toward science and technology courses, attitude scale development",

    "abstract": "Following some years of declining health, Professor Maurice Crosland passed away on 30 August 2020 at the age of eighty-nine. Author of four influential scholarly monographs, Maurice played major roles in the British Society for the History of Science during the 1960s and 1970s as an active Member of Council, Honorary Editor of the British Journal for the History of Science (1965\u201371) and Honorary President of the society (1974\u20136). His academic career began in 1963 with his appointment to a lectureship in the History & Philosophy of Science at the University of Leeds. In 1974 the by-then Reader in History of Science secured a \u00a3100,000 Nuffield Foundation Grant with which to establish, for the first time, a dedicated history-of-science group at the University of Kent at Canterbury. Appointed Professor of the History of Science and Director of the Unit for the History, Philosophy and Social Relations of Science (known as the \u2018History of Science Unit\u2019 or simply \u2018the Unit\u2019), his objectives during the five-year Nuffield-funded period were to focus on promoting the research activities of the new group, build up much-needed library resources in a university which was barely ten years old, and effect a transition to a research and teaching Unit that would offer modules to undergraduates in each of the three principal faculties (Humanities, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences). His own research centred on French science during and after the Napoleonic period, with particular emphasis on the history of chemistry and the formal institutions and informal networks of Parisian science. In 1984 his work was recognized with the American Chemical Society's award of the Dexter Prize, a rare achievement for a British scholar.",

    "abstract": "The conflict in Somalia presents a typical example of crisis where sometimes the international response is at odd with the wishes of local administration and community. Whereas debate on the most appropriate and sustainable approach to resolving complex conflict like the one in Somalia continues, Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC) has emerged as a key determinant of successful peacekeeping operation. Whereas the scope of activities under the rubric of CIMIC is this article analyzed SSR carried out by AMISOM troops in Kismayo District of Somalia from year 2011 to 2020 as a thematic area of security enhancement. The study was anchored on liberal peacebuilding, state building and democratization theories. The target population of the study included residents of Kismayo district entailing community leaders, humanitarian workers, civil society, Jubbaland Security Forces (JSF) and AMISOM troops operating in the district. Onwuegbuzie and Collins (2007) typology of determining sample size in social science research was used to arrive at a sample size of 200 respondents. Primary data was collected using semi-structured questionnaires, interviews guide and Focused Group Discussions guide. Secondary data was sourced from published books, e-books, journals, reports, newsletters and conference papers. Collected data was grouped, corroborated, and presented using both quantitative and the qualitative research techniques in themes corresponding the objectives of the study. The study found out that 97% of Kismayo residents felt that AMISOM CIMIC program had reduced conflicts in the district, 83% felt that the security sector was effective in ensuring security and safety of the population. The study also found that demobilization, disarmament and reintegration CIMIC program had reduced chances of violent clashes in Kismayo by 89% chance. AlShabaab terror gang continued to threaten the peace efforts in Kismayo. The study recommends that more donor funding be channeled to Federal Governments of Somalia so that they develop strong security sector capable of defeating peace spoilers",

    "abstract": "Objective: Many branches of science are constantly changing and developing according to the innovations and the requirements of the era. Developments and medical information, especially in the field of medicine, renew itself every year. In this study, we aimed to analyze comparatively the place of anatomy education, which has an important place in undergraduate medical education, in the National Core Education Program (NCEP)-2020. \nMaterial and Methods: In this study, the categories of basic medical practices in NCEP-2020, clinical symptoms/findings/situations, core diseases/clinical problems and the relationship between learning levels and anatomy education were evaluated one by one. Parameters were expressed in percentile using a descriptive statistical method. There are 157 Basic Medical Practices in 9 sub-categories (A-I) within the scope of NCEP-2020. \nResults: It was determined that 48 of these were related to anatomy education. The number of basic medical practice was mostly in the E sub-category (n=23, 47.92%). The second sub-category with the highest number of basic medical practices was determined as B (n=16, 33.33%). \nConclusion: One of the important conclusions we have reached within the scope of the study is that NCEP-2020 has an important place in terms of scope in determining, developing and standardizing the educational curricula of medical faculties.",

    "abstract": "2020 was a challenging year for everyone. Labs and offices were closed, Zoom meetings abounded, and health and medical services were stretched to their limits. While we all struggled to learn new ways of working, Journal of Cell Science put in place measures to help our authors with their revisions as much as we could - we extended revision deadlines, reminded reviewers to limit requests for experimental revisions, and reinforced our scoop protection policy - you can read more about those measures here. We thank all of our authors for considering and trusting Journal of Cell Science as the platform for their valuable work in 2020. To give them guidance when handling these manuscripts, our Editors of course turn to peer reviewers, who continued to give generously of their time and expertise to help us maintain the high standards of the journal. We appreciate how much time and effort goes in to writing a good peer review that is helpful to both the editors in making decisions and the authors in revising their manuscripts - so we extend our sincere thanks for the insightful and scholarly guidance offered by our reviewers and, of course, their co-reviewers. We are pleased to publicly acknowledge all the reviewers and co-reviewers who completed reviews of Journal of Cell Science manuscripts in 2020 - the full list of their names can be found in the supplementary information.",

    "title": "COVID-19 and Beyond: Our Selections for the Best ES&T Letters Papers in 2020",
    "abstract": "Environmental Science & Technology Letters (ES&T Letters) publishes novel and urgent contributions in a timely manner and thus provides a unique international forum within the environmental science, engineering, and health communities. Selecting the Best Paper Awards presents a difficult task given the expectations we have for high-quality research. As our team of editors carefully reflected on the 137 papers published in the journal in 2020, which represented an \u223c11% increase from 2019, it is not surprising that a number of manuscripts examined aspects of the emergence of a major global pandemic. It is therefore fitting that four of the five Best Paper Awards focused on facets of COVID-19, particularly at the interfaces of environment and health. Please join us in extending warmest congratulations to the winners! One of the year\u2019s Best Papers specifically focused on the use of environmental science and engineering to inform the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Medema and colleagues in \u201cPresence of SARS-Coronavirus-2 RNA in Sewage and Correlation with Reported COVID-19 Prevalence in the Early Stage of the Epidemic in The Netherlands\u201d (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00357) were among the very first to document the presence and concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Although the virus is primarily respiratory, its RNA is shed in high concentrations in the stool of many infected individuals, and these authors confirmed it can be detected in sewage. Medema et al. further showed that concentrations in sewage were associated with COVID-19 occurrence in the surrounding communities contributing to the sewer system. Since this paper was published, the use of wastewater-based epidemiology to track COVID-19 infections has expanded globally beyond the laboratories of academia to industrial laboratories, public health departments, and national disease surveillance institutes. In addition to this area becoming an increasingly important pursuit during the pandemic, it continues to advance studies of urbanization in general and population health and urban metabolism in particular. In their mini-review paper entitled \u201cSystematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Persistence and Disinfection of Human Coronaviruses and Their Viral Surrogates in Water and Wastewater\u201d (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett. 0c00313), Silverman and Boehm provided a timely contribution, again at the interface of environment and health. When this paper was contributed, there was limited information about the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater. Thus, there was a decided need to understand coronavirus decay rates in wastewater and the effectiveness of various disinfection processes. This work more broadly supported the wastewater-based epidemiology efforts described above. Looking forward, this article provides a useful example of the benefits of using systematic review approaches within environmental science and technology. In addition to water and wastewater considerations, the world continues to experience profound impacts of COVID-19 on ambient air quality as the pandemic continues. In one of the first studies, \u201cSubstantial Changes in Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone after Excluding Meteorological Impacts during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Mainland China\u201d (https://pubs.acs. org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00304), Zhao and colleagues investigated the short-term responses of air quality to COVID-19 in mainland China during the second half of January 2020 when the virus suddenly hit the country and triggered national quarantine. By integrating nationwide ground-level observations with model simulations, they successfully separated the impacts of emission reductions and meteorological factors on air-quality changes. Zhao et al. reported a significant increase in the level of O3 during the quarantine while that of NOx declined. By evaluating data from individual cities, they show the important but spatially varying roles of emission and meteorology in driving short-term airquality changes during the COVID-19 quarantine. The study concludes that it is essential and important to consider the coimpacts of meteorology and different chemical mechanisms in evaluating air pollution control policies and countermeasures. The COVID-19 lockdown also provided a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of significant reductions in anthropogenic emissions on air quality. In their paper \u201cDriving Forces of the Changes in Air Quality during the COVID-19 Lockdown Period in the Yangtze River Delta Region, China\u201d (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett. 0c00511), Liu et al. found that an ambient PM2.5 decrease was mainly caused by the emission reductions of primary PM, but an O3 increase was driven by NOx emission reductions as well as changes in meteorological conditions. The investigators also demonstrated that enhanced O3 promoted secondary aerosol formation and partially offset the decrease in PM2.5 caused by",

    "abstract": "In the most recent report published by the World Health Organization concerning people with visual disabilities it is highlighted that by the year 2020, worldwide, the number of completely blind people will reach 75 million, while the number of visually impaired (VI) people will rise to 250 million. Within this context, the development of dedicated electronic travel aid (ETA) systems, able to increase the safe displacement of VI people in indoor/outdoor spaces, while providing additional cognition of the environment becomes of outmost importance. This paper introduces a novel wearable assistive device designed to facilitate the autonomous navigation of blind and VI people in highly dynamic urban scenes. The system exploits two independent sources of information: ultrasonic sensors and the video camera embedded in a regular smartphone. The underlying methodology exploits computer vision and machine learning techniques and makes it possible to identify accurately both static and highly dynamic objects existent in a scene, regardless on their location, size or shape. In addition, the proposed system is able to acquire information about the environment, semantically interpret it and alert users about possible dangerous situations through acoustic feedback. To determine the performance of the proposed methodology we have performed an extensive objective and subjective experimental evaluation with the help of 21 VI subjects from two blind associations. The users pointed out that our prototype is highly helpful in increasing the mobility, while being friendly and easy to learn.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the context of a deeply polarized electorate, venturing into analysis of current events in the Political Science classroom can be fraught, especially regarding the quality of democracy. We argue that we have a responsibility to give students the tools to engage with the current moment of democratic tension, including questions of the quality and sustainability of democracy in ways that link with current events. The 2020\u20132021 academic year threw the urgency of this task into sharp relief. In this paper, we suggest a series of classroom interventions\u2013in information literacy, conceptualization, and losers\u2019 consent\u2013which can help students leverage social science research skills to analyze current events without falling into undesirably heated partisan discussion. We argue that this suite of activities, which can be deployed throughout a semester, either as structured or on-the-fly interventions, can serve as a toolkit for instructors to engage their students\u2019 pressing questions while maintaining an appropriately analytic lens.",

    "title": "29th NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC PRACTICAL CONFERENCE \u201cNATURAL SCIENCE EDUCATION IN A COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL \u2013 2023\u201d: CONFERENCE REVIEW",
    "abstract": "This year, the scientific conference \"Natural Science Education in a Comprehensive School - 2023\" was held in its usual format. It is worth mentioning that during the Covid-19 pandemic, three conferences were held remotely, in 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nThis two-day conference focused on science and technology education, which is a recent priority in society. There is a need to improve the teaching of science subjects and technology at all levels of general education. Particular attention should be paid to early science education. Ensuring adequate science and technology education means providing children with an education that teaches them to reason, think logically, explore, be creative and active. \nThe plenary session of the conference was international and very interesting. A total of four keynote speeches were presented during this session. It is clear that the Plenary \"bridged\" different continents - Africa, Latin America, Europe. Professor Andris Broks discussed systemic issues in science and technology education, with a particular focus on the major challenges and changes of the present. Speakers from South Africa and Brazil shared their experiences in organising research activities for future teachers. Experiences from both countries in the training of science teachers were explored. The plenary also discussed developments in science education in the updated General Curricula in Lithuania. \nInformal discussions at the conference focused on educational experiences during the pandemic. All participants acknowledged that education in a pandemic is significantly more difficult. This is especially true for various non-formal education activities, or activities that take place outside the regular classroom (e.g. various project activities, research activities, etc.).\nParticipants, especially those who are more or less regular attendees, stressed the importance of a \"live\" meeting. After all, informal communication has the main purpose of enabling a person to understand and be understood. This cannot be achieved in an online (remote) conference. It was hoped that the work of the conference would continue.\nMost conference reports were presented in the form of articles and published in the conference proceedings. One can find full texts in the database at: https://oaji.net/journal-archive-stats.html?number=1984&year=2023&issue=20002 \nKeywords: national conference, practical work, science education, science teachers, science pedagogy",

    "title": "Anti-System Politics: The Crisis of Market Liberalism in Rich Democracies By Johnathan Hopkin. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020. 272p. \u00a318.99.",
    "abstract": "A few weeks ago, I was giving a lecture on the institutionalization of the Five Star Movement to a group of first-year political science students. At the end, a pupil asked me how, if all parties are doomed to narrow their most radical promises once in government, it is possible to \u2018change the system\u2019. I had no compelling answer for the student\u2019s question, but Jonathan Hopkin\u2019s book on anti-system politics can help us to disentangle this matter. The book essentially proposes an explanation for the rise of what the author defines as \u2018antisystem politics\u2019 rooted in the changes in rich democracies\u2019 political economy, or better \u2018a theory of anti-system politics that puts economic change at the center stage\u2019 (p. 50). But what is \u2018antisystem politics\u2019? Hopkin draws on Sartori\u2019s well-known definition and argues that while in the 60s anti-system parties opposed the liberal-democratic order, in this historical period they oppose \u2018neoliberal democracy\u2019, that is to say \u2018an economic model that ultimately only worked for a minority, and a political system that closed off alternatives to it\u2019 (p. 10). Anti-system politics is thus the structural response to the failures of the (political and economic) system, and the symptom of the failure of the political establishment to represent popular demands for protection from the brutal effects of the economic crisis. With its focus on structural economic factors, the main alternative theory that the book seeks to deny, or better to complement, is Inglehart and Norris\u2019 theory on the \u2018cultural backlash\u2019, according to which \u2018the rise of authoritarian populism is the consequence of a conservative reaction against the cultural \u201csilent revolution\u201d of socially liberal attitudes\u2019 (see Gilles Pittoors\u2019 book review published in the issue 50 of this journal). The book is structured in three main parts. The first part deals with the relationship between capitalism and democracy and explains the current crisis of political representation as the consequence of economic changes that have subjected Western societies to growing inequality and insecurity, while undermining the ability of political institutions to respond to popular pressures. Then the author proposes the framework that underpins the second and third part of the book, devoted to anti-system politics in the Anglosphere (UK and USA) and Eurozone (Greece, Portugal, plus two separate chapters on Spain and Italy). The core of the author\u2019s reasoning is that \u2018the more societies are exposed to economic and financial distress, the more likely it is that anti-system forces will win greater shares of the vote\u2019 (p. 83). Differences in institutions (in particular, the structure of the welfare state) determine the extent and nature of anti-system support: both what the author defines as \u2018anti-system left\u2019 and \u2018anti-system right\u2019 have in common the rejection of the neoliberal order; while the former expresses it in the form of a fight against inequality, the latter does it in the name of the defense of national interests. In the US and the UK, the countries most affected by the inequality produced by the market system, anti-system left (namely, Sanders and Corbyn) and right (Trump and the Brexit",

The 2020 statistics released in 2021 showed that about 37.6 million people globally are living with HIV; 1.5 million people became newly infected in 2020 and 690,000 people died from AIDS related cases the same year. A literature search revealed that more than 1.6 million Nigerians have died of HIV/AIDS since the outbreak of the epidemic in 1985 while millions of Nigerians are living with HIV as of today. Certain factors have contributed to this alarming statistic. One of such is the unwillingness by most persons to undertake an HIV test due to the fear of stigmatization. A simple system that can be of help in evaluating a person\u2019s risk of contracting HIV without stigmatization is developed in this work. The system takes into account some behavioural factors, signs and symptoms that suggest a person may be at risk of having or be prone to HIV and thus makes a prediction of the risk status based on the input supplied. A simple framework was developed with input from medical practitioners based on their wealth of experience. The input was used to derive twenty two (22) questions centered on behavioural factors, signs and symptoms which were designed to be answered by the users during interaction with the system. A simple evaluation takes place using the user\u2019s inputs and a predefined set of rules to classify the risk value as one of (Very High, High, Moderate, Low and Not at Risk) with appropriate advice. The system was implemented in Visual Studio Environment using Visual Basic.Net. It is expected that after using the system, users will be encouraged to go for tests where it is recommended. However, it to be noted that this system does not confirm HIV status as only a blood test can do that",

    "abstract": "The present study aims to examine the effect of the life skills training guide on the development of pre-service science teachers\u2019 professional knowledge of entrepreneurial skills. The study included 82 pre-service science teachers studying in the third year of a public university in Turkey during the 2019-2020 academic year. The data of the study, which was conducted with a one-group pre-test-post-test experimental design, were collected using the entrepreneurship skills professional knowledge test. The data were analyzed using the professional knowledge assessment rubric and entrepreneurship skill indicators. The results of the study revealed that there was a significant difference between the pre-and post-test scores of the pre-service teachers in favor of the post-test scores. Following the experimental process, their professional knowledge about entrepreneurship increased. However, the number of pre-service teachers who were able to improve their professional knowledge scores to a high level was limited. Furthermore, following the experimental process, there was an increase in the number of pre-service teachers who were able to develop appropriate activities for students to gain entrepreneurial skills and to prepare tools for measuring and evaluating students\u2019 entrepreneurial skills in a way to include stressed indicators. Consequently, the present study provides science teacher educators with educational activities that they can model within the scope of teaching professional knowledge of entrepreneurship skills to pre-service science teachers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The UC San Diego Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute Dissemination and Implementation Science Center (DISC) launched in 2020 to provide dissemination and implementation science (DIS) training, technical assistance, community engagement, and research advancement. DISC developed a program-wide logic model to inform a process evaluation of member engagement and impact related to DISC services. The DISC Logic Model (DLM) served as the framework for a process evaluation capturing quantitative and qualitative information about scientific activities, outputs, and outcomes. The evaluation involved a multimethod approach with surveys, attendance tracking, feedback forms, documentation of grant outcomes, and promotions metrics (e.g., Twitter engagement). There were 540 DISC Members at the end of year 2 of the DISC. Engagement in the DISC was high with nearly all members endorsing at least one scientific activity. Technical assistance offerings such as DISC Journal Club and consultation were most frequently used. The most common scientific outputs were grant submission (65, 39%), formal mentoring for career award (40, 24%), and paper submission (34, 21%). The DLM facilitated a comprehensive process evaluation of our center. Actionable steps include prioritizing technical assistance, strengthening networking opportunities, identifying streamlined approaches to facilitate DIS grant writing through writing workshops, as well as \u201coffice hours\u201d or organized writing leagues.",

    "abstract": "In the author\u2019s previous medical research reports, he mainly applied physics theories, engineering models, mathematical equations, computer big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, as well as some statistical approaches to explore and interpret various biophysical phenomena. However, the majority of medical research papers he has read thus far are primarily based on statistics. As a result, in this article, he selects some basic statistical tools, such as correlation, variance, p-values, and multiple regression analyses, to study the predicted body weight as the output (dependent variable) by using his foods quantity and sleep score as inputs (independent variables). Since 5/1/2015, the author has been collecting various data related to his food nutrition (~0.5 million data) and sleep conditions. The Food Details (FD) category includes both food quantity (m9a) and food quality (nutrition, m9b). Previously, he has researched and published a few articles regarding the relationship between body weight and quantity of food consumption. During 11/8/2020 - 11/10/2021, he experimented with intermittent fasting experiments to study their inter-connectivity. In this paper, he will combine sleep score (m7) with food quantity (m9a) and connected them with his body weight in early morning (m1) using the multiple regression analysis method. In this study, he will not repeat the detailed introduction of the regression analysis in the Method section because it is available in many statistics textbook. It should be noted that in regression analysis, the correlation coefficient R should be > 0.5 or 50% to indicate a strong inter-connectivity and the p-value should be <0.05 to be considered as statistically significant.",

    "abstract": "Events in the year 2020 threw human service systems into chaotic states, threatening peoples\u2019 lives and livelihoods. Before 2020, there were many profound challenges to human life that had been well documented by efforts such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be a \u201clast straw\u201d crisis that has destabilized modern human civilization. This article diagnoses various crises of human service systems (e.g., COVID-19, inequality, and climate change) and proposes the metaphor of service ecosystem health for reimagining service science in a postpandemic world. Service ecosystem health is defined as the interdependent state of private, public, and planetary well-being necessary for sustaining life. This article reimagines service science, broadens transformative service research, builds the service ecosystem health metaphor, outlines the Goldilocks Civilization thought experiment, and explores designing for a Goldilocks civilization. Because service is for humans, the ultimate objective is to elevate service science to uplift human well-being.",

The observation instrument used an observation sheet based on the assessment indicators of students' activities during learning. Data analysis in this study used quantitative descriptive analysis, where each average value is described in each aspect of the assessment based on indicators. The results showed that the experimental class that applied the Real Science Mask with QR Code had the highest average score of Problem-Solving skills in the assessment aspect of discussing the suitability of scientific phenomena with a score of 9.4 and scientific literacy on the aspect of student assessment in seeking scientific references with a score of 8.8. The posttest results obtained a t-count value of 8,951 with df = 16, consulted with the t-table value at a significance level of 5%, and df = 16 obtained 2,120. These results indicate that the value of t-count is greater than the t-table value (8,951 > 2,120) it means that there is a significant difference between the experimental and control classes. Furthermore, the average of these two aspects of the assessment is higher when compared to the control class. These results indicate that the Real Science Mask with QR Code is effective in improving students' problem-solving skills and scientific literacy.",

    "title": "Asynchronous Learning: Its Effects on Academic Performance and Students\u2019 Motivation In Science",
    "abstract": "The main purpose of the study is to determine the effect of asynchronous learning to academic performance and students\u2019 motivation towards Science. It is necessary since motivation serves as a foundation for better understanding of science concepts in an asynchronous setting. The respondents are 201 grade 11 students of Iligan Computer Institute (ICI) who are enrolled during the Academic Year 2020-2021. The ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) model was used in the study for the development of asynchronous lesson on Genetic Engineering with Google Classroom as the online platform. The research utilized SMTSL (Students Motivation Towards Science Learning) questionnaire developed by Tuan, et al. (2005) composed of 35 questions encompassing six (6) domains of motivation namely, self-efficacy, active learning strategies, science learning value, performance goal, achievement goal and learning environment stimulation. Quantitative data together with qualitative analysis showed that students are moderately motivated towards science learning in an asynchronous environment. The highest identified domain is science learning value indicating that students find the relevance of science with daily life which makes them motivated to learn science even in a remote learning environment where there is no direct contact and supervision. In contrast, self-efficacy and performance goal are the least domains suggesting that students are least concerned with their own ability to perform well in science learning tasks and they do not compete with other students and get attention from the teacher. Using the researcher-made achievement test and performance task to measure their academic performance, 80% of the students belong to approaching proficiency, proficient and advanced groups showing that students did well in science in an asynchronous learning environment.\u00a0 Moreover, students\u2019 motivation was significantly correlated with science academic performance so science academic performance can be used as indirect evidence of students\u2019 motivation. Based on these findings, it is recommended that curriculum experts and educators consider factors of motivation in revisiting the science curriculum in an asynchronous environment.",

    "abstract": "The year 2020 experienced an unprecedented pandemic called COVID-19, which impacted the whole world. The absence of treatment has motivated research in all fields to deal with it. In Computer Science, contributions mainly include the development of methods for the diagnosis, detection, and prediction of COVID-19 cases. Data science and Machine Learning (ML) are the most widely used techniques in this area. This paper presents an overview of more than 160 ML-based approaches developed to combat COVID-19. They come from various sources like Elsevier, Springer, ArXiv, MedRxiv, and IEEE Xplore. They are analyzed and classified into two categories: Supervised Learning-based approaches and Deep Learning-based ones. In each category, the employed ML algorithm is specified and a number of used parameters is given. The parameters set for each of the algorithms are gathered in different tables. They include the type of the addressed problem (detection, diagnosis, or detection), the type of the analyzed data (Text data, X-ray images, CT images, Time series, Clinical data,...) and the evaluated metrics (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1-Score, and AUC). The study discusses the collected information and provides a number of statistics drawing a picture about the state of the art. Results show that Deep Learning is used in 79% of cases where 65% of them are based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and 17% use Specialized CNN. On his side, supervised learning is found in only 16% of the reviewed approaches and only Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Regression algorithms are employed.",

    "abstract": "This research study presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) exploring the convergence of Cybersecurity and User Experience (UX) fields over the five-year period from 2018 to 2022. Employing a methodology based on recommendations from PRISMA [1], Nightingale [2], and Silva and Neiva [3], we conducted extensive data collection from the Web of Science Core Collection, resulting in 1860 records. These records underwent two rounds of screening, including manual reviews of titles, abstracts, and author keywords, followed by a manual review of the full articles. 1013 publications were selected for further analysis, including word frequency and thematic analysis using the NVivo software tool [4], [5]. The analysis also examined publication types, temporal and geographical distributions, and the top conferences/journals based on frequency. The results indicated consistent scholarly activity with a slight dip in 2020, likely due to pandemic-related disruptions. North America and Europe showed higher research activity, led by the US. While Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Data and Systems Security domains emerged as key themes within the discourse on Cybersecurity and UX convergence, we acknowledge that these results are meant to lay a foundation for understanding Cybersecurity and UX research, while encouraging further exploration.",

We leveraged a cluster-randomized trial and compared survey data collected over two timepoints to explore whether these impacts persisted. Although more than a year had passed, 74% of participants reported that their research was affected in multiple ways in both 2020 and 2021. These data suggest that the effects of the pandemic on early-career researchers may be prolonged. Our findings additionally serve as an impetus to identify and implement solutions to early-career challenges that undoubtedly existed before the pandemic, but which COVID-19 brought into the spotlight.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates Instagram's efficacy as an educational tool in veterinary sciences, focusing on dairy cow nutrition and management. Using the Instagram account \"Stalla Didattica Unibo,\" established in December 2020, a survey was conducted with 102 respondents, primarily consisting of university students (44.12%). The respondents were divided into 2 major groups: students and the general population, with the latter comprising professionals and others not currently in educational programs. In the overall population, the age group of 25-34 accounted for 51%, but among students, it was 73.3%. In terms of gender distribution, there was a female majority in the general population (59.8%) and a male majority among students (73.3%). Most responders were from Italy, with Emilia-Romagna contributing significantly. Engagement was measured not only by the length of time participants followed the account but also by active interactions such as likes, comments, and shares. Among the total population, 47.1% had followed the page for over a year, compared with 37.8% of students. Importantly, engagement metrics showed active participation, with a majority reporting improved knowledge (75.6% of the total population and 74.5% of students) and practical application of content (64.4% of the total population and 67.6% of students). Content preferences varied, with the general population favoring quizzes (33.3%) and stories (17.8%), while students showed a stronger preference for standard posts (36.3%). Impact was defined as the perceived influence of the Instagram content on the respondents' learning and professional practices, with 46.7% of the total population and 52.9% of students agreeing or strongly agreeing that the page had a positive impact on their knowledge and practical skills. Furthermore, 84.3% of students and 77.8% of the total population stated they would recommend the page to others, underscoring the account's effectiveness as a digital educational tool. The study highlights Instagram's potential to enhance veterinary education and suggests further research to explore the broader application of these strategies across different educational contexts and platforms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose This study explores the underlying research topics regarding CRISPR based on the LDA model and figures out trends in knowledge transfer from science to technology in this area over the latest 10 years. Design/methodology/approach We collected publications on CRISPR between 2011 and 2020 from the Web of Science, and traced all the patents citing them from lens.org. 15,904 articles and 18,985 patents in total are downloaded and analyzed. The LDA model was applied to identify underlying research topics in related research. In addition, some indicators were introduced to measure the knowledge transfer from research topics of scientific publications to IPC-4 classes of patents. Findings The emerging research topics on CRISPR were identified and their evolution over time displayed. Furthermore, a big picture of knowledge transition from research topics to technological classes of patents was presented. We found that for all topics on CRISPR, the average first transition year, the ratio of articles cited by patents, the NPR transition rate are respectively 1.08, 15.57%, and 1.19, extremely shorter and more intensive than those of general fields. Moreover, the transition patterns are different among research topics. Research limitations Our research is limited to publications retrieved from the Web of Science and their citing patents indexed in lens.org. A limitation inherent with LDA analysis is in the manual interpretation and labeling of \u201ctopics\u201d. Practical implications Our study provides good references for policy-makers on allocating scientific resources and regulating financial budgets to face challenges related to the transformative technology of CRISPR. Originality/value The LDA model here is applied to topic identification in the area of transformative researches for the first time, as exemplified on CRISPR. Additionally, the dataset of all citing patents in this area helps to provide a full picture to detect the knowledge transition between S&T.",

    "abstract": "Multi-center research initiatives offer opportunities to develop and strengthen connections among researchers. These initiatives often have goals of increased scientific collaboration which can be examined using social network analysis. The National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control (ISC3) initiative conducted an online social network survey in its first year of funding (2020) to (1) establish baseline network measures including the extent of cross-center collaboration and (2) assess factors associated with a network member\u2019s access to the network such as one\u2019s implementation science (IS) expertise. Members of the seven funded centers and NCI program staff identified collaborations in planning/conducting research, capacity building, product development, scientific dissemination, and practice/policy dissemination. Of the 192 invitees, 182 network members completed the survey (95%). The most prevalent roles were faculty (60%) and research staff (24%). Almost one-quarter (23%) of members reported advanced expertise in IS, 42% intermediate, and 35% beginner. Most members were female (69%) and white (79%). One-third (33%) of collaboration ties were among members from different centers. Across all collaboration activities, the network had a density of 14%, suggesting moderate cohesion. Degree centralization (0.33) and betweenness centralization (0.07) measures suggest a fairly dispersed network (no single or few central member(s) holding all connections). The most prevalent and densely connected collaboration was in planning/conducting research (1470 ties; 8% density). Practice/policy dissemination had the fewest collaboration, lowest density (284 ties\u2019 3% density), and the largest number of non-connected members (n=43). Access to the ISC3 network varied significantly depending on members\u2019 level of IS expertise, role within the network, and racial/ethnic background. Across all collaboration activities, most connected members included those with advanced IS expertise, faculty and NCI staff, and Hispanic or Latino and white members. Results establish a baseline for assessing the growth of cross-center collaborations, highlighting specific areas in need of particular growth in network collaborations such as increasing engagement of racial and ethnic minorities and trainees or those with less expertise in IS.",

    "title": "The Impact of Lockdown During the COVID-19 Outbreak on Dietary Habits in Various Population Groups: A Scoping Review",
    "abstract": "Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to fresh food has been restricted, and people are spending more time inside and have limited their physical activity. However, more time at home may have resulted in some positive habits including an increase in cooking. The aim of this review was to assess dietary changes during the first lockdown. Themes and patterns were considered and associations with other lifestyle factors were assessed. Methods: Between June and July 2020, the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases were searched, and results were screened for eligibility based on title, abstract, and full text. The inclusion criteria of this search included: papers published (or in pre-print) in the year 2020; studies that investigated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on diet; papers published in English. Exclusion criteria were as follows: papers examining dietary changes in those following a structured diet based on diagnosed conditions or dietetic advice; literature, systematic, or narrative studies reviewing previous research. Researchers agreed on the study characteristics for extraction from final papers. Results: Four thousand three hundred and twenty-two studies were originally considered with 23 final full-text papers included. Four themes were identified: dietary patterns, dietary habits (favorable), dietary habits (unfavorable), and other (includes physical activity levels, weight gain). A total of 10 studies reported an increase in the number of snacks consumed, while six studies found that participants increased their meal number and frequency during quarantine. Eleven studies reported favorable changes in dietary habits with an increase in fresh produce and home cooking and reductions in comfort food and alcohol consumption. However, nine studies found a reduction in fresh produce, with a further six reporting an increase in comfort foods including sweets, fried food, snack foods, and processed foods. Two studies reported an increase in alcohol consumption. In eight studies participants reported weight gain with seven studies reporting a reduction in physical exercise. Conclusion: The effect of COVID-19 lockdown both negatively and positively impacted dietary practices throughout Europe and globally, and negative diet habits were associated with other poor lifestyle outcomes including weight gain, mental health issues, and limited physical activity. Both in the short term and if sustained in the long term, these changes may have significant impacts on the health of the population.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the change in soil organic carbon (C) stock in a warmer climate and the effect of current land management on that stock is critical for soil and environmental conservation and climate policy. By simulation modeling, we predicted changes in Australia\u2019s soil organic C stock from 2010 to 2100. These vary from losses of 0.014\u20130.077 t C ha\u22121 year\u22121 between 2020 and 2045 and 0.013\u20130.047 t C ha\u22121 year\u22121 between 2070 and 2100, under increasing emissions of greenhouse gases and temperature. Thus, Australian soil will be a net emitter of CO2. Depending on the future socio-economic conditions, we predict that croplands will accrue as much as 0.19 t C ha\u22121 year\u22121 between 2020 and 2045 due to their management, but accrual will decrease with warming and increased emissions by 2070\u20132100. The gains will be too small to counteract the losses of C from the larger areas of rangelands and coastal regions that are more sensitive to a warmer climate. In principle, prudent management of the rangelands, for example, improving grazing management and regenerating biodiverse, endemic native plant communities, could sequester more C and mitigate the loss; in practice, it may be more difficult, requiring innovation, interdisciplinary science, cultural awareness and effective policies.",

Comparative to the developing world, most African countries pre the Covid-19 outbreak, the education sector especially science and research called for stringent and important actions to upgrade to international standards. The closure of schools and institutions of tertiary educations following the pandemic disrupted and threw the sector into disarray. The educators were brought into an abrupt apprehension of the importance and relevance of the internet to the educational sector. But, are the systems in place?

    "title": "How Science Gets Drawn Into Global Conspiracy Narratives",
    "abstract": "A few short years ago, mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) was the subject of fundamental research, but it is now known as the basis for COVID-19 vaccines. At the same time, the concept has become linked\u2014particularly on social media\u2014to global conspiracy theories attributing nefarious motives to people associated with science. How did this happen? In our work, we use social media data to track evolving narratives empirically. By analyzing the terms that have become associated with mRNA on Twitter since early 2020, we have gained insight into how seemingly innocuous scientific concepts acquire sinister connotations through association. Understanding how this process occurs can be helpful in determining which countermeasures might be effective. Hashtags are key to this analysis. Used to cross-link social media posts, hashtags generally consist of a word preceded by a pound symbol: #mRNA, for example. Hashtags make such concepts easier to find because they can be easily searched. By observing how hashtags co-occur over time, we learn how ideas are linked to each other on social media. This approach is useful for understanding the ways in which disparate concepts become related to evolving narratives. To find out how the term mRNA became connected to farflung conspiracy theories, we collected a sample of 87,000 tweets containing the hashtag #mRNA over the three-year period from early 2020 to the end of 2022. This allowed us to look at how mRNA was juxtaposed with other ideas on social media over that time. Our analysis looks at time continuously, but we\u2019ve found it helpful to take \u201cslices\u201d from the dataset to highlight the way the narrative took shape and then shifted over time. We looked at where #mRNA occurred next to other hashtags, which gives a sense of how the term became connected to other ideas. We presented this data visually, displaying the connections as a network where each node represents a different hashtag and each edge represents the number of times two hashtags co-occur in our dataset. Starting with tweets using the hashtag #mRNA, this method allows us to see how sometimes unexpected semantic networks of associations can develop around ideas. Although co-occurring hashtags should not be taken as representing general discussions about mRNA, their changing patterns over time may offer insights into how issues may be hijacked and misinformation spread. In our first sample, from early 2020, the hashtags cooccurring with #mRNA were largely scientific or financial, reflecting prepandemic views. To make this network graph more readable, we \u201ccleaned\u201d the data, systematically removing all hashtag nodes above and below certain thresholds determined by number of connections. The distance between nodes indicates how often terms are used together in posts, and the size of the text reflects the sum of its connections. Thus, larger text shows terms that are highly interconnected. The color coding reflects which communities are involved, which is discovered through an automated process that examines connections. The first figure depicts a mostly pale green community made up of hashtags corresponding to scientific terms as well as a gray colored community devoted to discussing biotech investment. These figures make it possible to examine how the narrative around mRNA evolved over time. As vaccines went into production, new semantic networks associated with the term quickly began to develop. One cannot simply assume this method represents all the opinions that are \u201cout there\u201d in society, but it can nevertheless be quite helpful in MARC TUTERS, TOM WILLAERT, AND TRISHA MEYER REAL NUMBERS",

    "abstract": "Background and aim: The learning experience, satisfaction, attitude (ESA), and challenges are important in the evaluation of distance education courses. Materials and method: A cross-sectional study was conducted amongst students from April to May 2020. A total of 251 students were approached to participate in this study. The questionnaire was validated using Cronbach's alpha (0.946) and distributed online socio-demographic and ESA questions. The data was collected and analysed by using IBM SPSS version 23. Result: 70.5% of respondents was female and 7.5% of the respondents in this survey was mature students (>25 years old). Respondents had average ESA towards VL during this MCO period (mean = 2.79, 2.86, 2.50). Gender, age, faculty, year of study and mode of study were not significantly associated to experience and satisfaction towards blended learning. However, age and mode of study were significantly associated towards the attitude in VL (p<0.05). There was also correlation between experience and satisfaction (r = 0.721, p < 0.01), experience, and attitude (r = 0.575, p < 0.01) and satisfaction and attitude (r = 0.507, p < 0.01). The main challenge in VL that students reported is lacking good internet connection, which dampened the learning process. Conclusion: Our results shown student had average ESA towards VL. There is a need to offer affordable high-speed internet and to instil active learning with gadget among students in Malaysia.",

    "abstract": "The Global Justice Index is a multiyear research project based at Fudan Institute for Advanced Study in Social Sciences that assesses the contributions made by each country to achieving greater global justice. We have published results for yeas from 2010 to 2020 in Global Justice Index Report from 2019 to 2022, and are now presenting our fifth year of results, covering data from 2021 in Global Justice Index Report 2023, which is an updated version of previous years\u2019 reports. But, we have been improving our index year by year to with changes that have taken place globally. We have also refined our imputation methodology to better address the challenge of missing data. The report consists of four sections: introduction, findings, main results, and conclusion. In the introduction, we discuss the development of the conceptual framework and evaluative principles to justify our selection of the dimensions and indicators for measurement. Next, in the findings section, we report the data, indicators, and our results for each country for each of the 10 issues we identify, and provide regional comparisons for Asia, Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and Oceania. In the following section, we present the main results for the global justice indices, and report the ranking of each country\u2019s contribution to achieving greater global justice. In the final section, we discuss the applications and limitations of the index and potential further research trajectories.",

    "abstract": "This investigation was conducted to determine the path coefficient analysis using 40 genotypes of sponge gourd at the experimental plot of Department of Vegetable Science, College of Horticulture, UHS, Bagalkot (Karnataka) in RBD design along with two replications during the year 2020-2021. Path co-efficient analysis considered as one of the best statistical methods which can help breeders to characterize the genotypes during the parent selection program and select the desirable genotypes for higher yield production. Path coefficients analysis showed thatthe traits like number of fruits per vine, average fruit weight, fruit length, number of branches per vine and vine length had positive direct effect on fruit yield per vine. Thus the higher magnitude of positive direct effect of these traits explains the higher value of association between these traits on yield per vine. Therefore, direct selection for these traits would reward for yield improvement in sponge gourd.",

    "abstract": "A pot experiment was conducted during the year 2020 at the Institute of Agricultural Sciences, BHU, Varanasi, to study the impact of organic and inorganic sources of nitrogen on nutrient content in wheat and soil physic-chemical properties of the Inceptisols of eastern Uttar Pradesh. The experiment was arrangedin completely randomized design with 10 treatment combinations having three replications. The experiment results indicated that use of 50% of the recommended nitrogen dose through urea along with 50% N through poultry manure in integration significantly enhanced the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassiumcontent in grain and straw compared to the control. The T5 treatment, in which combined use of 50% RDN and 50% poultry manure recorded highest micronutrient concentrations (i.e. Zn: 14.3 and 21.41 mg kg\u22121, Cu: 37.83 and 20.66 mg kg\u22121, Mn: 20.03 and 3.65 mg kg\u22121, and Fe: 231.73 and 54.31 mg kg\u22121) in both straw and grain, respectively as compared to control (T1). The use of organic source with fertilizers also increased the post-harvest soil fertility as available N, P, and K, along with DTPA-extractable micronutrients. Overall, the treatment incorporating poultry manure @ 50% RDN and 50% PM (5.26 t ha\u22121) provided best results among all treatments in term of nutrient content of wheat and soil fertility.",

    "abstract": "Questions of equity, diversity, and inclusion in the sciences have taken center stage in light of the COVID\u201019 pandemic and Black Lives Matter movement of 2020. This paper focuses on the experiences of academics engaging in such work, particularly in their roles as educators, by sharing two of the authors' experiences introducing equity, diversity, and inclusion initiatives in a first\u2010year science course at a Canadian university. Using critical research methodologies like narrative inquiry and memory work, we look at three separate instances where complex personal, institutional and course attributes fostered, allowed, or hindered efforts to bring these initiatives into the classroom. We consider how problematic incidents and obstacles relating to the organization of content on equity, diversity, and inclusion in science cropped up during the process, how they were perceived and handled in the moment, as well as the authors' reflections, takeaways, and lessons learned from the experience. These stories suggest that efforts to center discussions about equity, diversity, and inclusion in undergraduate science classrooms can be unpredictable and complex, particularly at the day\u2010to\u2010day level;this is especially the case when handling subtler microaggressions rather than clear instances of discrimination or harassment. Our study points to the importance of creating a more permanent institutional memory for initiatives that outlive those who initiated and organized them, so that they become embedded within the culture of a course or department.

The study includes all authors of articles and reviews published in 10 library and information science journals during a 20-year period (2001\u20132020). The prior publication of each author is determined at the time of publication in one of the ten journals. The analysis includes 14,612 publications and publication histories of 36,417 authors. The results show that there are considerable differences between journals, and that the share of publications by less experienced researchers has generally decreased over time. Library automation journals publish considerably more publications by early career researchers than information science journals do. Publications in these 10 library and information science journals are being published by authors with an increasing publishing experience and fewer papers are being published by author teams with little experience.",

    "abstract": "Much research has been carried out on local wisdom at the junior high school level nationally, but research that has been published internationally and is Scopus indexed specifically discusses local wisdom at the junior high school level is still very minimal. The purpose of writing this research is as material to find out trends in local wisdom research in junior high school science learning. This study uses a bibliometric analysis method that uses sources from Scopus with publication limits from 2019 to 2023 on the Scopus database, and utilizes the VOSviewer application as a visualization tool. Data analysis through the Scopus database in this research was based on search results with local wisdom keywords written in the title words column and science learning as keywords. Found 45 publications in Scopus during 2019-2023 that discuss local wisdom in junior high schools. Published articles about local wisdom in junior high school science learning during 2019-2023 will be more researched in 2020 based on the results of data analysis through the Scopus database. The results of the bibliometric analysis research show that the trend of research on local wisdom at the junior high school level in the five year period (2019-2023) has focused more on the position of students as learning subjects and the development of research on local wisdom in junior high schools that specifically discusses the implications for strengthening the attitude of love for local culture for students have not been studied much",

    "title": "Implementing CARE Principles to Link Noongar Language and Knowledge to Western Science through the Atlas of Living Australia",
    "abstract": "The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), Australia's national online biodiversity database, is partnering with the Noongar Boodjar Language Centre (NBALC) to promote Indigenous language and knowledge by including Noongar names for plants and animals in the ALA. Names are included in the ALA species page for each plant and animal and knowledge is built into the Noongar Plant and Animal online Encyclopedia, hosted in the ALA. We demonstrate the use of CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics (Carroll et al. 2020)) to engage, support, and deliver the project and outcomes to the Noongar people and communities working with us. \n The ALA addresses the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016) for data management and stewardship ensuring data are findable, accessable, interoperable, and reusable. The ALA is partnering with NBALC in Perth to ensure all sharing of Noongar data is on Noongar terms. NBALC and ALA have been working with Noongar-Wadjari, a southern clan from the Fitzgerald River area in Western Australia, to collect, protect and share their language and traditional knowledge for local species.*1\n The Noongar Encyclopedia project exhibits Collective Benefit because it is a co-innovation project that was co-designed by NBALC and ALA. The project\u2019s activities were designed by the Community-endorsed representatives, the Knowledge Holders. The aims and aspirations of the Community were included in the project design to ensure equitable outcomes. NBALC\u2019s more than 25-year relationship with the Community, and as Noongar people themselves, meant they had a good understanding of what the Community might want from the project. These assumptions were tested and refined during the first Community consultation, before the project plan was finalised. The Community are keen for their traditional knowledge to be shared and freely available to their Community. The ALA only shared knowledge that has passed through strict consent processes. It is seen as a safe and stable digital environment for now and the future, and where the traditional knowledge can be accessed freely and easily. The link to western science knowledge is secondary to knowledge sharing for most of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities that the ALA are working with although the benefits of scientists having access to both knowledge systems is seen as a positive step in care for Country into the future.\n The Noongar Encyclopedia project ensures Noongar Authority to Control these data because NBALC, as an Aboriginal organisation, led by Noongar people, understands the rights and interests of the Communities we are working with. Protection of these rights and inclusion of Community interests are written into the project methodology as part of the project co-design. It is important to ensure the project is working with the right people within the Community. NBALC facilitates this by finding people who hold traditional knowledge, and can trace the stories back to their source. The appropriate governance of data is ensured because all collected data are stored and managed by NBALC. Project design includes rolling consent from Knowledge Holders who review all data collected, add or edit as needed, and give or deny consent for knowledge to be shared publicly through the ALA. \n The Noongar Encyclopedia project design ensures we understand the Responsibilities (CARE \"R\") involved in Indigenous data collection, protection, management and sharing. Through the partnership with the ALA, the NBALC is expanding its capabilities and capacity for digital data collection and management. The Community is building its capabilities and capacity for working with linguists and scientists. Including the Noongar language and traditional knowledge in the ALA shows non-Indigenous users of the ALA that there is another way to name, look at, talk about and record knowledge about species. This view differs from Western science. The Noongar view everything to be connected and group things based on their use and connectivity. Western science tends to classify species based on their physical attributes. Language is the key to this alternate world view. The ALA now publishes the scientific name, the English name and the Noongar word/s. The ALA links to the alternate science view of these species through the Noongar Encyclopedia, and two other Ecological Knowledge Encyclopedias (Kamilaroi and South East Arnhem Land).\n The Noongar Encyclopedia project is constantly subjected to Ethical assessment by the Community and through stringent Western ethical assessments and reviews. The Community ethical assessment included the project undergoing a number of evaluations before it started. The projects are co-designed with NBALC to ensure they are within protocol and community expectations. The ALA are then introduced to the Community. The Community decide if they are interested in the project, if it meets their aspirations, if they feel comfortable working with the ALA and potentially other scientists. Contributing scientists or academics are introduced to the Community by the NBALC. The Community maintains the right to decline to work with any introduced scientist or academic. All contributors are informed of this protocol before they are introduced to the Community.\n The Noongar Plant and Animal Encyclopedia was published in September 2021 (NBALC 2021).",

    "title": "The MET Norway Ice Service: a comprehensive review of the historical and future evolution, ice chart creation, and end user interaction within METAREA XIX",
    "abstract": "The MET Norway Ice Service (NIS) celebrated its fiftieth year as a formal operational sea ice information provider in 2020. Prior to the 1970\u2019s, support to navigation had started off with ad-hoc observations from coastal stations on Svalbard in the 1930\u2019s, before developing as a research programme in the 1960\u2019s. Activity in the region has steadily increased, and now the NIS also supports a large number of research, tourist, and resource exploration vessels, in addition to the ice chart archive being a resource for climate change research. The Ice Service has always been at the forefront in the use of satellite Earth Observation technologies, beginning with the routine use of optical thermal infrared imagery from NASA TIROS and becoming a large user of Canadian RADARSAT-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and then European Copernicus Sentinel-1, in the 2000\u2019s and 2010\u2019s. Initially ice charts were a weekly compilation of ice information using cloud-free satellite coverage, aerial reconnaissance, and in situ observations, drawn on paper at the offices of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) in Oslo. From 1997 production moved to the Troms\u00f8 office using computer-based Geographical Information System (GIS) software and the NIS developed the ice charting system Bifrost. This allowed the frequency of production to be increased to every weekday, with a greater focus on detailed sea ice concentrations along the ice edge and coastal zones in Eastern Greenland and in the Svalbard fjords. From 2010, the NIS has also provided a weekly austral summer ice chart for the Weddell Sea and Antarctic Peninsula. To further develop its capabilities, NIS engages in a number of national and international research projects and led the EU Horizon 2020 project, Key Environmental monitoring for Polar Latitudes and European Readiness (KEPLER). This paper summarises the overall mandate and history of the NIS, and its current activities including the current state of routine production of operational ice charts at the NIS for maritime safety in both the Arctic and Antarctic, and future development plans.",

    "title": "The Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Parents and their Adolescent Children in Relation to Science Learning",
    "abstract": "With the transition to distance-learning at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, several countries required parents and their children to remain at home, under lockdown. Many parents found themselves taking on additional responsibilities regarding their children\u2019s education. However, children do not always interpret their parents\u2019 intentions as they intended. This study investigated this complex relationship, showing that parents\u2019 emphases regarding science learning changed during the first COVID-19 lockdown and in parallel, the relations between these emphases and their adolescent children\u2019s goal orientation and self-efficacy toward science learning also changed. In 2019, one year before the COVID-19 lockdown, the children\u2019s mastery and performance orientations toward science, and their self-efficacy in science were significantly correlated with their parent\u2019s attitudes toward science. In 2020, shortly after the end of the first COVID-19 lockdown, these relations remained significant, but in addition the parents\u2019 emphasis on performance became a significant predictor of the children\u2019s mastery and performance orientations, and of their self-efficacy in science. A small increase in the children\u2019s performance orientation and self-efficacy in science was seen, and only a small decline in their mastery orientation toward science. These findings contrast with what the literature indicates is typical at this age, when there are no lockdown conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrest is a significant global health issue, with over 20,000 paediatric cases annually in the United States (AHA, 2020), and in Malaysia, coronary heart disease affects approximately 29,363 individuals each year, contributing heavily to national health concerns (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2021). To address this challenge, this study aims to strengthen evidence-based practice (EBP) in Malaysia through the integration of the TIME model (Transform, Innovate, Model, Enhancement) for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) public awareness for vital selfcare monitoring, particularly focusing on pulse monitoring and perfusion index (PI) as essential components of patient care. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, this research is grounded in the American Nurses Association\u2019s (ANA, 2024) EBP model. The primary objectives of the study are: (1) to assess the factors influencing the implementation of various CPR practices and public health monitoring awareness, (2) to analyse the relationship between CPR approaches and public health monitoring awareness through statistical regression analysis, and (3) to develop an EBP practice guide for strategic CPR awareness. A comprehensive literature review utilizing databases such as OUM e-library, Science Direct, AHA, and ResearchGate provided insights from over 150 relevant sources. A mixed-methods design was applied, including quantitative data from surveys and qualitative data from open-ended questionnaires, with a sample of 200 final-year nursing students. Findings will inform the development of a recommended EBP model enhancement and strategic CPR guidelines, culminating in an eBook for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) public awareness for vital selfcare monitoring 2025-2030. The TIME model\u2019s application in this context serves as a transformative and innovative framework that fosters best practices in CPR training and enhances public health awareness, on collaboration, patient-centred care, and the sustainability of health outcomes in Malaysia. focusing of Pulse Self-Monitoring for Public Awareness and CPR Readiness in Malaysia.",

    "title": "Effects of genotype and environment on the physiochemical properties of Canadian oat varieties",
    "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND The relationship between oat grain composition and physical attributes as influenced by oat genotype and Canadian growing environments was investigated. Thirty Canadian oat (Avena sativa L.) genotypes, grown in three Canadian growing locations (Brandon, Manitoba; Portage la Prairie, Manitoba; and Lacombe, Alberta) over 2 consecutive years (2020\u20132021), were analyzed. RESULTS Analysis of variance showed that the protein, total starch, and amylose content were significantly affected by genotype, environment, and their interaction. A principal component analysis bi\u2010plot illustrated that protein and total starch had an inverse relationship and were more affected by growing year, whereas amylose content had a negligible influence. The majority of genotypes were stable across environments but some genotypes, like CDC Morrison, were more influenced by different environments. Correlation analysis suggested that drought\u2010like conditions early in the growing season generated oat genotypes that favored the accumulation of protein, \u03b2\u2010glucan, and oil. CONCLUSION The results provide detailed information regarding the relationship between important oat chemical and physical traits and different growing environments, which can assist breeders to improve characteristics to obtain high\u2010quality oat grains and thus high\u2010quality end products. \u00a9 2025 His Majesty the King in Right of Canada and The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Water quality monitoring reveals changing trends in the environmental condition of aquatic systems, elucidates the prevailing factors impacting a water body, and facilitates science-backed policymaking. A 2020 hiatus in water quality data tracking in the Lower Passaic River (LPR), New Jersey, has created a 5-year information gap. To gain insight into the LPR water quality status during this lag period and ahead, water quality indices computed with 16-year historical data available for 12 physical, chemical, nutrient, and microbiological parameters were used to predict water quality between 2020 and 2025 using seasonal autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) models. Average water quality ranged from good to very poor (34\u2009\u2264\u2009\u00b5WQI\u2009\u2264\u200995), with noticeable spatial and seasonal variations detected in the historical and predicted data. Pollution source tracking with the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model yielded significant R2 values (0.9\u2009<\u2009R2\u2009\u2264\u20091) for the input parameters and revealed four major LPR pollution factors, i.e., combined sewer systems, surface runoff, tide-influenced sediment resuspension, and industrial wastewater with pollution contribution rates of 23\u201330.2% in the upstream and downstream study areas. Significant correlation of toxic metals, nutrients, and sewage indicators suggest similarities in their sources.

    "title": "Late Payment Issues Due to Covid-19 Pandemic in Malaysia Construction Industry",
    "abstract": "Delay or late payment in construction project is a common phenomenon and has become a habit in the construction industry. However, in the year of 2020, the pandemic of Coronavirus (COVID-19) has dramatically spread over the world and the issue of late payment becomes worse and critical. Many parties involved in the project affected especially the contractor. In line with the issue, the aim of this research is to identify the strategies to overcome the late payment issues due to the pandemic COVID-19 in the construction industry. The objectives of this research are to identify the factor that can lead to the late payment during the pandemic COVID-19, to determine the implication of late payment to the contractor due to COVID-19 pandemic and to suggest the potential strategies to overcome the late payment issue due to COVID-19 pandemic. Questionnaires were used to collect the data and was distributed via google form and door to door visit which focus on G6 Contractor in Petaling district. A total of 127 questionnaires were returned. The data obtained was analysed by using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software. The result shows that the suspension of work during Movement Control Order (MCO) is the factor influence late payment during pandemic, delay in project completion is the major implication of late payment due to pandemic and the proper planning and budgeting of project by client is the most recommended strategy to overcome late payment due to COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the finding of this research hope to help provide insight to contractor regarding the factor influencing late payment, implication of late payment during pandemic COVID-19 and at the same time to overcome the late payment issue due to COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: This paper describes the process developed at the University of Pittsburgh to increase the number of NIH-funded Diversity Supplements. Method: The authors formed a Diversity in Academia Workgroup where we created the infrastructure and process to increase the number of Diversity Supplements. Each year, the Office of Sponsored Programs provided a list of grants that would be eligible to submit a Diversity Supplement. We surveyed the Principal Investigators inquiring about their interest in working with a trainee on a Diversity Supplement. If yes, we included their information in a database we built so that trainees could search for eligible research studies. The Diversity Deans then identified underrepresented faculty and postdoctoral researchers. We invited Program Officers from NIH to participate in a panel presentation for trainees, which was well attended. Results: The number of Diversity Supplements awarded to Pitt researchers has significantly increased from 7 in 2020 to 10 in 2021 and to 15 in 2022. Six more have been awarded in the first half of 2023. Conclusions: We created the Diversity in Academia Workgroup with the goal to increase the number of Diversity Supplements at the University of Pittsburgh and in so doing, increase the diversity in the biomedical research workforce. While challenging, we know the critical importance and benefits of increased diversity at the University, and we have made significant strides toward this goal.",

    "abstract": "Introduction The incidence of skin conditions in young people typically varies between nations and within a single nation\u2019s regions based on social, economic, racial, and environmental factors. A significant public health issue is the morbidity that skin diseases cause in children. There is a dearth of research on this pediatric issue in our nation, which is either centered on a condition, a community, or a particular population group. Objective To evaluate the dermatological complaints of the pediatric patients attending a dermatology outpatient department in a tertiary care hospital. Materials And Methods We retrospectively analyzed a total of 2472 pediatric patients who were in age range 0-18 years and came to the OPD of dermatology & venereology department of Ibn Sina Medical College Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, over a period of 1\u00bd year from January, 2020 to June, 2021. Data were collected on special proforma and analyzed with appropriate method. Results Among 2472 patients 1157 (46.8%) were male and 1315 (53.2%) were female and most of the patients belonged to the age group 12-18 year (52.6%). Male female ratio was 0.88:1. All diseases were broadly classified into noninfectious (71.2%) and infectious dermatoses (28.8%). Dermatitis (38.9%), infections (28.8%) and acne (14.44%) came out to be the top most common cause for OPD attendances. For the specific skin diseases, 20.1% were atopic dermatitis, 14.44% were acne, and 11.8 % were fungal infections. Atopic dermatitis was the most common condition below 12 years of age. In 12-18 years of age group, the most common condition was acne; females were more affected than males. Among the viral infections, wart was the most common (22.1%). Conclusion Atopic dermatitis was found to be the most common noninfectious disease and fungal infection was the most common infectious disease in all age groups and genders.\nBangladesh Journal of Medical Science Vol. 23 No. 04 October\u201924 Page : 1054-1059",

    "title": "Patellar tendon complaints and shear wave velocity patterns in maturing alpine skiers",
    "abstract": "Introduction \nPatellar tendinopathy is frequent in adolescent athletes and particularly accentuated in competitive alpine skiers (Fr\u00f6hlich et al., 2020). Tendinopathies are characterized by long disease histories, and whether they can be healed completely is an open question (Kettunen et al., 2002). Three-dimensional (3D) shear wave elastography (SWE) has proven valuable in the early detection of tendinopathies (G\u00f6tschi et al., 2023). The aims of this study were to (1) describe the longitudinal progression of patellar tendon complaint prevalence in competitive alpine skiers during adolescence, (2) compare the SWV patterns of skiers that were symptomatic four years ago with those with no history of patellar tendon complaints and (3) analyse whether shear wave velocity (SWV) average values correlate with SWV coefficient of variation (CV). \nMethods \nForty-seven subjects were analysed in this 4-year follow-up study regarding their patellar tendon complaints and SWV patterns. Symptomatic and asymptomatic skiers were identified by clinical examinations including the criteria of pain sensation under loading and palpation-induced pain. SWV was determined by ultrasound-based 3D SWE. Prevalence differences were assessed using Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 tests. Group differences in the SWV patterns were analysed using unpaired sample t tests. Correlations between SWV average and CV values were analysed by means of Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. \nResults \nWith proceeding adolescence, the prevalence of patellar tendon complaints significantly decreased from 29.8% at baseline assessment (13-16 years) to 12.7% at follow-up assessment (Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 = 9.429; p = 0.002). Those skiers who were symptomatic at baseline but asymptomatic at the follow-up still had lower average SWV values and higher CVs than asymptomatic skiers with no history of patellar tendon complaints (p = 0.054 and p = 0.011, respectively). Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between the tendon SWV average values and their CVs (R = -0.55; p < 0.001). \nDiscussion/Conclusion \nDespite the decreasing prevalence of patellar tendon complaints in youth competitive alpine skiers after their growth spurt, structural abnormalities appear to remain in asymptomatic subjects with a previous history of patellar tendinopathy, indicating potential long-term implications for mechanical tendon proprieties. The SWV average and CV values were negatively correlated, which underlines our hypothesis that a low SWV is associated with a high CV. This altogether may reflect the degenerative processes in patellar tendons affected by complaints in the early stages of a sports career. \nReferences \nFr\u00f6hlich, S., Peterhans, L., Stern, C., Frey, W.

Due to a lack of systematic documentation regarding the occurrence of ADR and other issues to the safety of Ayurvedic medicines, concern about the traditional medical system has recently been increased. This is seen by a rise in safety reports and misunderstandings, especially in the recent pandemic. \nObjective: To monitor and analyse the suspected ADR to Ayurvedic medicines used in COVID-19. \nMaterials and Methods: ADR monitoring data was collected through spontaneous and intensive method for a span of 2-year (April 2020 to April 2022) during the peak days of COVID-19 from the IPvCC of the National Institute of Ayurveda, Jaipur, India. The IPvCC Program is governed by NPvCC under the supervision of Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India, New Delhi. NPvCC is ultimately responsible to monitor and recommend regulatory interventions on the generated national ADR data. \nResult: In a span of two-year, 142 adverse drug events were reported out of which 17 were confirmed as ADR due to suspected Ayurvedic drugs. \nConclusion: Overall review demonstrated that Ayurveda has traditionally been placed a strong emphasis on treatments that aim to heal the underlying illness while preventing the development of new illnesses. \nBangladesh Journal of Medical Science Vol. 23 No. 01 January\u201924 Page : 237-245",

    "abstract": "Background: It is estimated that 500 million individuals globally would have diabetes mellitus (DM) by 2030. A deadly tumor that affects the digestive tract is called gastric cancer (GC). It ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide and the fifth most common kind of cancer. Every year, there are around 700,000 fatalities and one million new cases of GC globally.\nAims : This systematic review is to review the association of diabetes mellitus as a risk factor of gastric cancer.\nMethods: This study demonstrated compliance with all requirements by means of a comparison with the standards established by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020. Thus, the specialists were able to guarantee that the research was as current as feasible. Publications released between 2014 and 2024 were considered for this search strategy. This was accomplished by utilizing a number of distinct online reference sites, including Pubmed, ScienceDirect, and SagePub. It was determined that reviews, previously published works, and partially completed works would not be included. \nResult: In the PubMed database, the results of our search brought up 343 articles, whereas the results of our search on SAGEPUB brought up 2178 articles, our search on SCIENCE DIRECT brought up 23102 articles. The results of the search conducted for the last year of 2014 yielded a total 231 articles for PubMed, 1017 articles for SAGEPUB and 12260 articles for SCIENCE DIRECT. In the end, we compiled a total of\u00a0 5 papers, 2 of which came from PubMed, 1 of which came from SAGEPUB and 2 of which came from SCIENCE DIRECT. We included five research that met the criteria.\nConclusion:\u00a0In summary, there is no direct association of diabetes mellitus and gastric cancer, but diabetes mellitus can increase the risk factor of gastric cancer cases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The transition of courses from in-person to an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic could have potentially affected overall student performance in lecture-based courses. The objective of this case study was to determine the impact of course format, as well as the effects of student sex, time of year at which the course was taken, and the institution it was taken at on student performance in an undergraduate animal science course. The course used for this study was taught at two institutions (University of Florida; UF and University of Nevada, Reno; UNR) over 7 yr (2014\u20132017 at UNR and 2018\u20132021 at UF). Student\u2019s performance (n\u2005=\u2005911) was evaluated using both quizzes and exams from 2014 through the spring semester 2020 and only exams were used for summer and fall semesters of 2020 and the spring and summer semesters of 2021. The final score (out of 100%) for each student was used to evaluate student\u2019s performance. In addition, students were classified as high-performing students, if they scored \u226595% and low-performing students, if they scored \u226470%. The variables evaluated were the effects of semester (spring, summer, or fall), institution (UF or UNR), sex (male or female), number of teaching assistants (TAs; 0\u201313), and course format (online or in-person). The course was taught in-person at UNR and in-person and online at UF. The spring semester of 2020 was taught in-person until March but was switched to online approximately 9 wk after the semester started and was considered an online semester for this analysis. As the course was only taught online at UF, the variable course format was assessed using UF records only. Data were analyzed using both linear models and logistic regressions. The probability that students were high performing was not affected by sex or institution. Interestingly, both fall semester and the online format had a positive, desirable effect on the probability that students were high performing. The probability that students were low performing was not affected by sex. However, if a student performed poorly in the class, they were more likely to have taken the course at UNR, or at UF with many TAs. Thus, student\u2019s performance was impacted by changing the course format, as well as institution, the number of TAs, and the semester in which the course was taken.",

    "title": "Physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep across lifespan in adults across European countries: Background and design",
    "abstract": "Introduction \nRegular physical activity (PA) has benefits for health throughout the lifespan. PA benefits musculoskeletal, cardio metabolic health, and overall well-being (Kapoor et al., 2022). However, data from 2017 shows that about 55-83% of women and 47-74% of men from European countries (EU) do not meet these guidelines (L\u00fcbs et al,. 2018). Moreover, adults at the age of 40-54 (aOR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52-0.81) and 55-64 (aOR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49-0.77) are less likely to have moderate or high levels of PA in comparison with those 18-24\u2009years of age. (Nikitara et al., 2021). Sedentary behavior (SB) including activities such as watching television, playing computer games, browsing the internet has increased (Wang et al., 2019). Canada has an established track record in the development of 24-hour movement guidelines on PA, SB, and sleep. They have previously release guidelines for all age groups. Following Canada\u2019s lead, several jurisdictions including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa have incorporated the 24-hour movement concepts (Tremblay, 2020). \u00a0There is a lack of data for 24-hour behavior guideline in the European context. There are no specific recommendations on SB and sleep. Therefore, this project will present the background, methods and design of a 24-hour movement summary of behaviors (PA, SB and sleep) in Europe. \nMethods \nWe will utilize existing PA, SB and sleep data from the World Health Organization on European adults 18+. Analysis using mean, median, and 95% confidence Intervals, will be complemented by frequency distributions and histograms. These will be stratified by age and sex subgroups for a more comprehensive overview. \nResults \nThe findings from this research have the potential to\u00a0 inform surveillance efforts, shape policies and public health strategies, improve overall well-being, and contribute to the development of evidence-based guidelines. \nDiscussion/Conclusion \nImplications of this research may inform researchers on further questions to pursue, policy makers in resource allocation, and practitioners on where to focus intervention efforts. \nReferences \nKapoor, G., Chauhan, P., Singh, G., Malhotra, N., & Chahal, A.

    "abstract": "Background: Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, and it is the fourth leading cause of cancer in women. The morbidity and mortality of cervical cancer in the developing countries are distinctly higher than those in the developed countries. Computer-assisted diagnosis is key for scaling up cervical cancer screening, but current algorithms perform poorly on whole slide image analysis and generalization.\u00a0 \nThe aim: This study aims to show about computed-assisted diagnosis in diagnostic cervical cancer imaging. \nMethods: By comparing itself to the standards set by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020, this study was able to show that it met all of the requirements. So, the experts were able to make sure that the study was as up-to-date as it was possible to be. For this search approach, publications that came out between 2014 and 2024 were taken into account. Several different online reference sources, like Pubmed and SagePub, were used to do this. It was decided not to take into account review pieces, works that had already been published, or works that were only half done. \nResult: In the PubMed database, the results of our search brought up 153 articles, whereas the results of our search on SagePub brought up 180 articles. The results of the search conducted for the last year of 2014 yielded a total 53 articles for PubMed and 72 articles for SagePub. The result from title screening, a total 18 articles for PubMed and 27 articles for SagePub. In the end, we compiled a total of 10 papers. We included five research that met the criteria. \nConclusion: Computed-assisted medical diagnosis can successfully complete a variety of medical tasks by efficiently exploring the essence of a large amount of clinical data. The colposcopy-guided cervical biopsy is essential for detecting CIN in cervical cancer screening, but there are difficulties with increasing sensitivity globally.\u00a0",

    "abstract": "In the year 2020 the world changed dramatically. We went from busy lives spent largely away from home to spending most of our time at home while daily facing deepening national crises. ABSTRACT In the year 2020 the world changed dramatically. We went from busy lives spent largely away from home to spending most of our time at home while daily facing deepening national crises. With the violent, needless death of George Floyd, the simmering tensions around race in America boiled over, sending thousands into the streets to protest racial injustices. The world of science education has largely avoided discussing racism in our classes, but we can no longer ignore it. The events of the spring and summer have highlighted our need to integrate conversations and reflections on justice into science education. In this work we argue that service learning can build this understanding from both theory and experience. Utilizing a critical online service-learning framework, we have developed a service-learning course that incorporates dialogic communication, cross-contextual reflections, and positioning oneself as an ally. This perspective allows science and the community to prioritize relationships, humanity, and reflect on our roles as professionals, utilizing the online interacting space. This course, taught at the beginning of the pandemic, focuses on critical online service learning for those studying public health. We discuss the challenges we faced moving critical service-learning pedagogy online, and the compounding issues brought on by the pandemic itself.",

    "abstract": "Founded in the year of 2004, the 20-year-old Chinese Football Association Super League (CSL) serves as a representative of the development of Asian football. Research focused on match performance within the CSL has gained momentum in recent years. This study provides a systematic review of match performance analysis in the CSL, detailing the analytical methods, core topics, major findings, and current research trends. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), a structured search was conducted in the Web of Science (WOS), PubMed and Scopus databases using targeted keyword combinations, initially identifying 184 studies. After thorough screening, 45 studies were included in the review. These studies were classified into three categories: descriptive analyses, comparative analyses, and predictive analyses. Findings reveal that comparative and predictive analyses are dominant, while descriptive analysis remains essential for data contextualisation. Technical and physical performance analyses are the main research topics to date. Observations suggest the CSL is evolving toward a high-intensity style, with foreign players and substitutes playing pivotal roles. Contextual and environmental factors have been shown to substantially impact match performance. Future research will likely trend towards standardised definitions, speed zones and data, expanding studies on contextual and environmental factors with an emphasis on tactical analysis, goalkeeper performance, set-piece situations, and distinct phases of play.",

    "title": "Maize breeding enhances lodging resistance through vertical allocation changes of stem dry matter and nitrogen",
    "abstract": "The maize stem provides structural support to other plant organs and stores carbohydrates and nitrogen (N) that can be remobilized to grain. Yet it remains unknown whether breeding programs have indirectly affected vertical stem dry matter and N allocation. Our objectives were to i) determine the dry matter and N allocations across different stem portions in maize hybrids released from 1980 to 2020 at the start (R2) and end of grain-filling period (R6), and ii) investigate the dry matter and N remobilization patterns by stem portion. We studied 23 Bayer Crop Science hybrids (release year 1980 to 2020) of different relative maturities (short and long maturity) in 2021 and 2022. Stem dry weight, N concentration, and N content by stem portion (four equal-length sections) were measured at R2 and R6 stages. We found that the average vertical distribution of the stem dry matter and N content along the plant height was 8% (top), 17% (middle-top), 29% (middle-bottom), and 46% (bottom). Maize breeding slightly reduced the total stem dry matter and N content at R2 stage in both relative maturities, and this reduction occurred in the top two quarters, with no significant change in the bottom stem portion. At R6 stage, the N content was significantly reduced in long maturity hybrids, and all the stem portions contributed to this reduction. Newer hybrids of both relative maturities remobilized less dry matter than the older hybrids (17 vs 20%) but slightly more N (39 vs 36%). We concluded that maize breeding efforts have indirectly affected vertical stem dry matter allocation towards less stem dry matter above the ear leaf. This change reduces plants\u2019 center of gravity, which could explain why new hybrids are more resistant to lodging and can accommodate high plant densities. This study brings new data and knowledge, which enhances our understanding of indirect breeding consequences on maize plant traits.",

    "title": "The Beam Commissioning of SC Cyclotron-Based Proton Therapy System With Fast Energy Selection and Precise Gantry",
    "abstract": "Since 2016, a superconducting cyclotron (SC)-based proton therapy (PT) system has been designed, constructed, installed, and commissioned at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). It includes a SC CYCIAE-230, a beamline with a fast energy selection system (ESS), a 360\u00b0 gantry, and a pencil beam scanning nozzle. Also, there is another beamline for proton irradiation, for example, used for space science research. This article will briefly introduce the overall design of the PT system. The results of the beam commissioning, from the cyclotron to the nozzle, will be emphasized. As early as September 2020, the proton beam\u2019s energy accelerated by the SC reached 231 MeV; the 360\u00b0 gantry had been tested by experts and found an isocenter better than 0.3 mm at any angle. After obtaining comprehensive commissioning permission in late November last year, we finished the test of the PT system with the following results: the energy of the cyclotron is 242 MeV, the energy range of the degrader is 71\u2013242 MeV, the maximum average beam intensity extracted is 462 nA, and the measured efficiency of the beam from the central region to outside the cyclotron is 74%; it is 45 ms the time interval varying one energy step of the degrader and 51 units of the magnets. The results will be presented in detail in this article.",

    "title": "The Emotional Valence of Hyperrationality in STEM Learning: Reinscriptions and Contestations of Coloniality",
    "abstract": "As part of the special issue Centering Affect and Emotion Toward Justice and Dignity in Science Education, this paper examines the emergence and performance of hyperrationality in STEM classrooms. Hyperrationality describes verbal and embodied expressions whereby learners try to maintain an appearance of neutrality and emotional distance to give credence to political, socioscientific convictions, even under conditions where complete emotional detachment would be unconscionable. Hyperrationality in STEM learning environments poses a threat to human dignity (Espinoza et al. 2020) by reinscribing approaches to STEM that devalue the lives and lived experiences of those \u201cothered\u201d. We present a comparative analysis of cases taken from our respective (individual) studies focused on ethics, historicity, politics, and STEM learning. The first case is drawn from an undergraduate engineering ethics class discussion of militarized drones. The second case is from a year\u2010long socioscientific unit on water enacted with Black children in a city wrestling with water shut\u2010offs. In our analysis of these two cases, we consider how hyperrationality, the ungrievability of the other and racialized fear become components of interpretative repertoires that learners co\u2010construct to compartmentalize and/or partially reconcile the inherent contradictions arising from these entanglements. Our cases evidence the emotional configurations of colonality that reinscribe imperialism, while also recognizing when/how nondominant communities resist these logics as they surface in STEM classrooms.",

    "title": "Building New Opportunities: Planning Towards Integrated, Open and Accessible Natural History Collections",
    "abstract": "The accessibility, value and role of natural history collections (NHCs) for nature conservation, education and society in general, increases over time. The concept of NHCs evolves through advancements in information systems, research methods, and collection studies (Miller et al. 2020). Therefore, we need a new infrastructure for NHCs, which provides the necessary physical and organizational structures to support this evolving approach, including digitization labs, digital solutions for improved workflows, and architectural designs like publicly viewable collection workplaces. With this concept, the contemporary museum constitutes a shared space that recognises the importance of nature, supported by a science-based approach.\n The Estonian Museum of Natural History (EMNH) is currently making one of the largest developmental leaps in its 160-year history. In total, approximately 360,000 specimens, dating back 200 years, are preserved in the museum\u2019s storage facilities. The museum\u2019s collection contains specimens from around the world and is focused on Estonia\u2019s natural heritage. The collection includes extensive mycological, zoological, botanical, geological, and science-related historical artifacts (e.g., collecting equipment, models of specimens), along with photo and multimedia collections. Currently, 95% of the museum's collections are digitized. The specimen data is published in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), with the original data housed on the PlutoF and Geocollections platforms.\n Although the museum plays a significant role in advancing the natural sciences, people outside the museum's circle might find it difficult to perceive how vast and unique the collections are, and what kind of work is done behind the scenes. The role of collections in science, education or society in general is also only vaguely acknowledged.\n By constructing a new building for the EMNH, scheduled to open in 2027, new opportunities arise. As a new community centre, the museum provides the opportunity for visitors, emerging professionals, citizen scientists, students, etc. to enhance and share their knowledge of the importance of biodiversity.\n Some examples of the numerical growth the new building will bring, compared to old museum facilities, are as follows: the museum could attract 200 000 more visitors than we are able to welcome in the current building. The new building will have ten times more exhibition space and the collection area will enlarge more than 50% from its current size.\n Many infrastructural and conceptual ideas applied in the new building will contribute to integrating our NHCs into society. Extra workspace will provide sufficient room for curators and students, researchers, and interns. New curator workrooms contain flexible spaces for different projects. The exhibition hall features display windows allowing visitors to peek into the curator\u2019s workrooms, collection spaces, and the wet preparations lab. By embracing the principle of an open collection, the museum offers a unique opportunity to observe how specimens are stored and what procedures are involved in their preservation. This way the usually hidden part of the museum is integrated to the exhibition.\n A special room is planned for a mixed collection, comprised of a variety of differently prepared specimens and a display of various storage methods. The room will be primarily used to welcome groups and provide educational visits. For hands-on education, the new building will house a learning laboratory, classrooms and a space with direct access from the street for workshops, meetings, and experimental exhibitions, making it easier to engage passers-by. The exhibition area will have a multifunctional activity space within the exhibition, where museum staff can showcase various sections of their work.\n The digitization lab provides the opportunity to create high-quality photos and digital twins of specimens (Reinhardt et al. 2024), making them more accessible among scientists and the wider public. Improved digital imaging quality enhances research possibilities for photo analysis and AI applications. The new workshop also provides an excellent opportunity for conservation and taxidermy of specimens.\n We engaged target groups from school children to specialists during the planning process to make a museum that fulfills their needs. The new museum is planned as a platform that engages the society, initiates discussions, and brings together various target and interest groups to discuss environmental topics. By planning and building new infrastructure for the EMNH, we develop both digital and physical functionality and make our NHCs more accessible to all interest groups.\n The concept of open collections brings the behind-the-scenes activities to everyday visitors, engages people, and informs them about the opportunities and the role of NHCs. The new core exhibition and the science-based environmental-educational activities tightly linked to our NHCs will create a new incubator for positive changes. By developing and introducing new methods of making our NHCs accessible to a wider audience, the collections can better assist the society in making decisions and raising awareness.",

    "title": "Green Chemistry: Approach to Improve the Performance of Grade 11 STEM Students in Chemical Equilibrium",
    "abstract": "Most science activities and programs provide emphasis on saving the environment. The Green Chemistry approach matches this effort to enhance students\u2019 understanding of chemical concepts at the same time promote the value of responsible stewardship by applying principles that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances in the design of laboratory activities. This study focused on the use of Green Chemistry to improve the performance of Grade 11 students in Chemistry particularly on the topic on chemical equilibrium. This action research employed the experimental design where the 205 Grade 11 STEM students enrolled during the second semester of the school year 2019-2020 were exposed to two Green Chemistry laboratory activities in chemical equilibrium. The pretest and posttest data were analyzed using appropriate statistical measures namely: highest possible score, highest score obtained, lowest score obtained, mean, mean percentage score, median and standard deviation. The level of performance of the Grade 11 STEM students were further described as high, average or low. Paired samples t-test analysis of students\u2019 pretest and posttest assessments was carried out at 0.05 level of significance. The results of the pretest revealed an \u201caverage\u201d level of performance among the Grade 11 STEM students. Higher scores are evident during the posttest showing a \u201chigh\u201d level of performance. The effectiveness of the Green Chemistry approach was further established by comparing the performance of the Grade 11 students in the pretest and posttest. Their posttest scores were significantly higher than their pretest scores. The results suggest that the green chemistry approach is effective in improving the students\u2019 performance in Chemistry specifically in their understanding of one of the most complex topics which is chemical equilibrium. Prior to the intervention, most students held misconceptions about chemical equilibrium. However, after using the green chemistry approach, they gave logical explanations about systems in equilibrium and how they were affected by external stresses. The Green Chemistry hands-on activities helped the students to improve their performance in chemistry by reinforcing the development of students\u2019 concepts in chemical equilibrium while taking measures to save the environment. It is recommended that the green chemistry teaching approach be adopted by other chemistry teachers in Urdaneta City Division. Similar approach can also be used in teaching other science concepts. The study shows that the Green Chemistry approach greatly improved the Grade 11 STEM students\u2019 understanding of Chemical Equilibrium. Pre-test scores averaged 7.81 with no high performers, while post-test scores rose to 15.15, with 63.4% of students achieving high performance. A paired t-test confirmed a significant improvement (p < .05), proving the effectiveness of Green Chemistry in teaching complex topics. Additionally, the approach promoted environmental awareness, making it a valuable teaching method for broader use in science education.",

    "title": "Solving Unemployment in Kenya by Integrating Education, Training and Market",
    "abstract": "Africa\u2019s youth unemployment rate is estimated to grow from 10.7% as in 2020 to 42% in 2030 with the current education and training. According to the National Council for Population and Development, Youth (15 \u2013 34 year old), who form 35 percent of the Kenyan population, had the highest unemployment rate of 67 percent in 2017. The major cause of unemployment is various types of mismatches. The general objective of the study was to find out the mismatch between skill acquisition at the university and the absorption at the job market. A sample of 50 students from science and mathematics related courses who had completed industrial attachment was used for the study. Another 100 degree graduates were asked what they were doing after graduation. Seventy five percent (75%) of those who went for attachment confirmed a mismatch of what they learn at the university and what is at the industry. Sixty five percent (65%) of the graduates were in a vertical education mismatch employment and 35% were still searching for employment. Generally, it was observed that there is a mismatch between education, training and the market. There is need to prioritise the implementation of training programmes based on the demand in terms of study level and field of study, an update of curricula by integrating the lacking soft, digital and job search skills, a settlement of a collaborative network between employers and training institutions, an implementation of mentoring programmes and an investment of enterprises in the adequate training of youth as social responsibility.",

    "title": "THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF GLAUCOMA AND ITS ASSOCIATIONS WITH FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE FACTORS",
    "abstract": "Background: Estrogen may have a neuroprotective role in glaucoma, and estrogen insufficiency is thought to contribute to glaucomatous damage through both mechanical and vascular processes. \nMethods: By comparing itself to the standards set by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020, this study was able to show that it met all of the requirements. So, the experts were able to make sure that the study was as up-to-date as it was possible to be. For this search approach, publications that came out between 2014 and 2024 were taken into account. Several different online reference sources, like Pubmed and SCIENCE DIRECT, were used to do this. It was decided not to take into account review pieces, works that had already been published, or works that were only half done. \nResult: In the PubMed database, the results of our search brought up 93 articles, whereas the results of our search on SCIENCE DIRECT brought up 76 articles. The results of the search conducted for the last year of 2014 yielded a total 41 articles for PubMed and 26 articles for SCIENCE DIRECT. In the end, we compiled a total of\u00a0 6 papers, 4 of which came from PubMed and 2 of which came from SCIENCE DIRECT. We included six research that met the criteria. \nConclusion:\u00a0In summary, a longer duration of OC usage may be related with a higher risk of OAG; however, it is unclear if OC use in general raises the risk of OAG or whether this potential association is mediated by IOP. An earlier age at natural menopause may increase the incidence of OAG. Most significantly, PMH use may be related with a lower IOP, and the estrogen-only kind of PMH may be associated with a lower risk of OAG.",

    "title": "Innovation and implementation determinants of HIV testing and linkage-to-care in the U.S.: a systematic review",
    "abstract": "Objective To identify innovation and implementation determinants of HIV testing, diagnosis, and linkage-to-care in the U.S. Data sources and study setting Between November 2020 and January 2022, a broad search strategy was employed in three literature databases: Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Study design A systematic review guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Data collection/extraction methods A team of master\u2019s and Ph.D.-level researchers screened eligible studies against the inclusion criteria and extracted the data using COVIDENCE software in pairs with consensus performed by a senior member of the team. Barriers and facilitators were extracted and analyzed according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Frequency of determinants across studies was mapped according to CFIR, valence, study design, delivery setting, unit of analysis, population of interest, region of the U.S., and year. Results We identified 1,739 implementation and innovation determinants from 186 articles. Most determinants were for HIV testing rather than linkage-to-care. Most determinants were identified in the inner setting and individuals domains of CFIR, with the fewest identified in the process and innovations domains. Determinants of providers were only slightly more frequently identified than determinants of recipients. However, determinants of organizations and systems were rarely identified. Conclusion This review provides a synthesis of innovation and implementation determinants of HIV testing and linkage-to-care using the most-cited implementation science (IS) framework, CFIR. This synthesis enables the larger field of HIV science to utilize IS in efforts to end the HIV epidemic and positions IS to consider the application of IS frameworks to fields like HIV.

    "abstract": "Abstract We use several sources to collect and evaluate academic scientific publication on a country-wide scale, and we apply it to the case of France for the years 2015\u20132020, while presenting a more detailed analysis focused on the reference year 2019. These sources are diverse: databases available by subscription (Scopus, Web of Science) or open to the scientific community (Microsoft Academic Graph), the national open archive HAL, and databases serving thematic communities (ADS and PubMed). We show the contribution of the different sources to the final corpus. These results are then compared to those obtained with another approach, that of the French Open Science Barometer for monitoring open access at the national level. We show that both approaches provide a convergent estimate of the open access rate. We also present and discuss the definitions of the concepts used, and list the main difficulties encountered in processing the data. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the respective contributions of the main databases and their complementarity in the broad framework of a countrywide corpus. They also shed light on the calculation of open access rates and thus contribute to a better understanding of current developments in the field of open science.",

    "title": "Emergence of the metaverse and ChatGPT in journal publishing after the COVID-19 pandemic",
    "abstract": "As soon as I took office as president of the Korean Council of Science Editors (KCSE) on January 17, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began. Therefore, most workshops and seminars held by the KCSE were operated online. The training programs designed were all executed without any difficulties. There were four workshops in 2020, 11 in 2021, and nine in 2022. The editors and staff of the KCSE\u2019s member institutes participated in these events more actively than before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the number of participants increased. Even before the pandemic, scholarly journal publishing had already been digitalized and implemented online through manuscript management systems (e-submission systems); therefore, the pandemic did not cause operational problems. The number of submissions during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic soared, especially in the medical field [1] and on the topic of COVID-19 itself. Many scientific articles have helped medical professionals care for persons infected with COVID-19. Therefore, scientific journals received a very high level of recognition as a valuable resource for society as a whole during this critical pandemic. I am delighted to see that scientific, technological, and medical journals in Korea have played a pivotal role in combating COVID19, and I am proud to have served as the president of the organization of those journal editors for 3 years. I applaud our members for their devotion to journal publishing as editor-publishers [2]. As I complete my term as president, I would like to emphasize two emerging trends in journal publishing: the metaverse and artificial intelligence. Regarding the latter topic, I wish to discuss ChatGPT and some issues related to its use in scholarly publishing.",

    "abstract": "Much debate surrounds the choice of programming language for teaching computer science. Our institution's replacement of a visual programming language (RAPTOR) with a textual programming language (Python) provided a novel opportunity to explore the impacts of the programming language on students' learning and perception of programming. We conducted a randomized comparative study that involved 1083 students who took our introductory computing course in the 2019-2020 academic year. A unique aspect of our work stems from our course being a general education requirement; thus, our study includes students with a wide variety of backgrounds and majors. This report presents a comparison of student performance in each version of the course, including the impact of the programming language on underrepresented groups, and provides a summary of student feedback. Our results show that students in our introductory course performed similarly overall, but overwhelmingly perceived Python to be more valuable.",

    "abstract": "In the first 9 weeks of in-person instruction in North Carolina schools, we found extremely limited within-school secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2, determined by contact tracing. BACKGROUND: In an effort to mitigate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), North Carolina closed prekindergarten through grade 12 public schools to in-person instruction on March 14, 2020. On July 15, 2020, North Carolina\u2019s governor announced schools could open via remote learning or a hybrid model that combined in-person and remote instruction. In August 2020, 56 of 115 North Carolina school districts joined The ABC Science Collaborative (ABCs) to implement public health measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and share lessons learned. We describe secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within participating school districts during the first 9 weeks of in-person instruction in the 2020\u20132021 academic year. METHODS: From August 15, 2020 to October 23, 2020, 11 of 56 school districts participating in ABCs were open for in-person instruction for all 9 weeks of the first quarter and agreed to track incidence and secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Local health department staff adjudicated secondary transmission. Superintendents met weekly with ABCs faculty to share lessons learned and develop prevention methods. RESULTS: Over 9 weeks, 11 participating school districts had >90\u2009000 students and staff attend school in person. Among these students and staff, 773 community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections were documented by molecular testing. Through contact tracing, health department staff determined an additional 32 infections were acquired within schools. No instances of child-to-adult transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were reported within schools. CONCLUSIONS: In the first 9 weeks of in-person instruction in North Carolina schools, we found extremely limited within-school secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as determined by contact tracing.",

    "title": "CTS teams: a new model for translational team training and team science intervention",
    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Clinical/translational science (CTS) is team-based, requiring effective collaboration and communication across many disciplines involving a variety of stakeholders. We implemented a pre-doctoral team-based training model with didactic and experiential curricular interventions to support the development of CTS research skills in a cross-disciplinary team environment. We assessed the potential impact of this new training model as a team science intervention that can catalyze new cross-disciplinary collaborations across the institution. Methods: Between 2016 and 2020, 32 pre-doctoral students and 26 co-mentors participated in the assessment of the CTS Team program over a two-year period of TL1 training grant support. Data collection and analyses followed a program logic model and used a variety of metrics for clinical and translational scientist career success. Results: CTS training in the context of CTS Teams supported improved self-efficacy for clinical research skills and resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of participation in cross-disciplinary collaborative activities by both trainees and mentors. Most CTS Team co-mentor pairs had not previously collaborated. Two-thirds of the co-mentors plan to continue collaborating, and most (85%) currently use or plan to use collaboration tools, for example, written collaboration plans, authorship agreements. Conclusions: The CTS Team training model provides a unique clinical and translational science team training experience that embeds authentic cross-disciplinary research collaboration into PhD research projects. It establishes trainee cohorts that are diverse in terms of scientific disciplines and translational research phases, and creates a new cross-disciplinary community of practice across faculty members and research groups in multiple colleges.",

    "abstract": "This research aims at analysing the effect of the Virtual Laboratory (VL) to improve science literacy and problemsolving skills among junior high school students. This research employed a Quasi-experiment with Nonequivalent Control Group Design. The population in this research was the seventh-grade students of junior high school in the Special Region of Yogyakarta in the academic year of 2019/2020. The sample was selected through a cluster random sampling technique and taken the control and the experimental class comprehensively from three school clusters (high, medium, and low) in each district/ city. The data analysis technique used the N-Gain analysis, prerequisite test, and hypothesis testing consisting of MANOVA and effect size. Based on the MANOVA test, it was found that there was a difference in the escalation of students\u2019 scientific literacy and problem-solving skills between the control and the experimental class. Meanwhile, based on the calculation of the effect size, it was found that the effect of the Virtual Laboratory was quite high (effect size = 0.897) on the increase in scientific literacy and high effect (effect size = 1.027) on the increase of problem-solving skills, respectively, among junior high school students.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is generating a high number of deaths worldwide. One of the current questions in the field of environmental science is to explain how air pollution can affect the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on public health. The research here focuses on a case study of Italy. Results suggest that the diffusion of COVID-19 in cities with high levels of air pollution is generating higher numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths. In particular, results reveal that the number of infected people was higher in cities with more than 100 days per year exceeding limits set for PM10 or ozone, cities located in hinterland zones (i.e. away from the coast), cities having a low average speed of wind and cities with a lower average temperature. In hinterland cities having a high level of air pollution, coupled with low wind speed, the average number of infected people in April 2020\u2014during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014is more than tripled compared to cities with low levels of air pollution. In addition, results show that more than 75% of infected individuals and about 81% of deaths of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy are in industrialized regions with high levels of air pollution. Although these vital results of the first wave of the COVID-19 from February to August 2020, policymakers have had a low organizational capacity to plan effective policy responses for crisis management to cope with COVID-19 pandemic that is generating recurring waves with again negative effects, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, on public health and of course economic systems.",

    "title": "552 Substance Abuse Research: Bench to Community (SARB2C) as a Model for Team Science",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/GOALS: To present Substance Abuse Research: Bench to Community (SARB2C) as a model for team science both within and between institutions. Emerging from targeted efforts by the NIH to engage translational scientists in prominent public health issues, the initiative illustrates the benefits of bringing together researchers and trainees to share ideas. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: In 2019 a group was formed at University of Florida to discuss ongoing translational research in the area of substance abuse, including faculty, staff, and trainees from across the campus. The group was expanded in February 2022 to include domestic colleagues at the University of Kentucky as well as international collaborators at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand. One-hour monthly meetings began in person but now take place virtually. Larger projects are discussed individually, focusing on opportunities for collaboration. Attendees also provide updates on their work, including proposals in development and manuscripts in process. This facilitates dialogue around the science, from the bench to the community, and connects people to advance team science. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In light of the ongoing opioid epidemic and the public health threat of other emerging substances, collaboration among researchers in this area is essential to advance the science and explore real-world solutions. SARB2C demonstrates the benefit of connecting researchers across T0 to T4, and that of including trainees for invaluable experience. This environment fosters open discussion and creativity and helps break down the silos that impede science. A highlight from early in the group\u2019s history was a visit from the Program Officer for the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute in February 2020. Since that time, multiple collaborations have resulted in grants submitted, such as P30 center grants and an innovative R61/R33, as well as numerous publications. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: A complex public health emergency like the opioid epidemic requires creativity and collaboration, from laboratory science to interventions in the community, putting it squarely within the sights of translational research. SARB2C will soon enter its fifth year of linking researchers and training the next generation of scientists.",

    "abstract": "Science and technology (S&T) plays a central role in today\u2019s knowledge- and technology-based society. The transfer of S&T from the education system to the economy should be promoted by teachers using innovative behaviour as an important aspect of providing high-quality education. Several studies have found that a mismatch exists between the economy and the education sector, and that this can be gradually reduced by innovation in the education system. This research aimed to examine the innovative behaviour of pre-service S&T teachers. A sample of 140 pre-service teachers from the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia was selected, and a set of instruments was used to measure their innovative behaviour in classrooms during the 2019\u20132020 academic year. A model was created and evaluated using multiple regression analysis. The results showed that self-efficacy and attitudes towards S&T strongly predict innovative behaviour, while situational interest may vary depending on the cognitive demands of tasks. A proactive personality was found to be a key factor determining innovative behaviour, while self-efficacy has direct and indirect influences on innovative behaviour, with its indirect influence mediated by creativity and situational interest. These findings have implications for the redefinition of educational design to enhance innovation in the classroom. \nKeywords: innovative behaviour, predictive modelling, pre-service teachers, science and technology",

    "title": "Transformative climate adaptation in the United States: Trends and prospects",
    "abstract": "Adapting to the new normal Successfully responding to the impacts of climate change will be a challenge for many communities, especially cities. Considering the situation in the United States, Shi and Moser examine how stakeholders can help to build urban resilience even in the absence of federal leadership. They discuss how local and state governments, private industry, and civil society can engage to adapt to the extreme weather events and other consequences of changing climate that are expected in the future. Preparing for these looming issues requires coherent, cohesive, and collective responses across all scales and sectors of society. Science, abc8054, this issue p. eabc8054 A Review highlights the many ways to help build greater urban resilience to climate change. BACKGROUND Climate disasters are on the rise, with devastating effects on communities, built infrastructure, and ecosystems. Between 2015 and 2020, the United States has seen an average of 14 disasters per year that cost at least $1 billion, compared with 6.5 such events annually between 1980 and 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic and attendant socioeconomic crisis have laid bare the United States\u2019 systemic vulnerabilities and difficulties in launching large-scale, coordinated, just, and effective responses to external shocks, resulting in short-term disruptions and prolonged crises. These same challenges inhibit societal adaptation to climate change, which is already being felt in communities nationwide as the number of disaster events and their geographic reach and intensity increase. The current financial downturn reduces resources for near-term resilience planning, further exposing cities to the next hazard event and driving vicious cycles of fiscal and environmental shocks. More than ever, preparing and adapting to climate impacts require a coherent, cohesive, and collective response across localities, sectors of society, and scales of governance. ADVANCES In this Review, we distill three major trends in federal government, industry, and civil society that shape how local communities adapt to extreme weather events and other climate change impacts. First, inconsistent federal leadership on climate adaptation has done little to address drivers of climate injustice and uneven development. The Obama administration initiated various policies to mainstream climate considerations into federal properties and investments that the Trump administration overturned. But even the Obama administration narrowly framed adaptation as disaster resilience, infrastructure investment, and national security issues rather than addressing the drivers of vulnerability, such as social, land, and income inequality. To date, the Biden administration appears to merely reinstate Obama-era approaches to adaptation. Second, design, engineering, and legal professions are considering systemic amendments to building codes and standards that could force federal and state governments\u2019 hands in addressing climate risk. Financial industry decisions over how to rate credit worthiness, where to issue mortgages, and when to raise or rescind insurance have the power to send mortgage markets and municipal revenues tumbling and increase the costs of infrastructure investment. At present, decisions in these arenas reflect professional and board room concerns for industry risk and liability rather than justice- and community well-being\u2013oriented outcomes. Third, grassroots and academic advocates increasingly call on leaders to redress exclusionary and environmentally exploitative development and avoid using climate resilience to rehash racialized capitalist development. The groups emphasize the need for an ethics of care, restoring urban and rural communities\u2019 relationship to land ownership and stewardship, and deepening democratic engagement. The growing divergence in how public, private, and civil society actors are responding to climate impacts contributes to maladaptive investment in climate-blind infrastructure, justice-blind reforms to financial and professional sectors, and ultimately, greater societal vulnerability to climate impacts. OUTLOOK A shift in presidential leadership alone will not alter the politics, power dynamics, and paradigms that shape US adaptation. Large-scale change such as infrastructure investments and managed retreat can preserve the status quo, unless reforms change the underlying social relationships and power dynamics and center a different set of values and beliefs about humans and human-nature relations. If public, private, and civil society actors are to take up the transformation imperative in a proactive and deliberate way, they need to address the material, relational, and normative factors that hold the current systems in place. Ambitious civil society and private sector leadership invite federal government to respond with bold, integrated, and holistic policies. Community movement strategies for coalition building, including ones across urban-rural divides, demonstrate how to build a political movement for just adaptation. Private-sector reforms of financial instruments pinpoint the places where community organizations and the federal government need to push for just and equitable adaptation. Despite substantial contestation, divergences also point to opportunities to better engage with and learn from one another to advance toward more transformative adaptation. We conclude with examples of possible directions for transformative practice and research in support of these efforts. Larger local jurisdictions, such as Oakland, and smaller neighborhoods around San Francisco Bay, California, struggle to advance urgent and equitable adaptation action. Leadership, coordination, capacity, regulatory alignment, and adequate funding are needed for coherent, cohesive, and collective preparedness and response. COVID-19 magnifies these needs and demonstrates the risks of complex crises. CREDIT: PI.1415926535/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/CC BY-SA 3.0 As climate change intensifies, civil society is increasingly calling for transformative adaptation that redresses drivers of climate vulnerability. We review trends in how US federal government, private industry, and civil society are planning for climate adaptation. We find growing divergence in their approaches and impacts. This incoherence increases maladaptive investment in climate-blind infrastructure, justice-blind reforms in financial and professional sectors, and greater societal vulnerability to climate impacts. If these actors were to proactively and deliberatively engage in transformative adaptation, they would need to address the material, relational, and normative factors that hold current systems in place. Drawing on a review of transformation and collective impact literatures, we conclude with directions for research and policy engagement to support more transformative adaptation moving forward.",

    "title": "THE INCLUSION OF RPA IN THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION",
    "abstract": "Over time, technological evolution has had an impact on all business organizations where the need to be able to constantly innovate in all the internal processes of your company is created. Today the commercial market is very competitive and causes companies to see a deeper horizon and adopt certain methodologies and new processes such as digital transformation.According to the consulting firm Mckinzey, due to the pandemic, it has forced many entities to advance this adoption of new technologies, including the optimization of some manual processes, which have to be automated, but before talking about these technologies, we will verify some stumbling blocks that the digital transformation has that we detail below. according to (Weaver, 2021): 1) The approval of the directors: This is the biggest obstacle of the 3 points because most probably the directors in their planning have invested technological tools that due to pandemic issues, these became obsolete, but according to studies at the beginning of the year 2020 ( KPMG, 2020), \u201c67% of executives in the United States expressed a great concern regarding the migration of all their businesses to the cloud, however, this quickly turned from being a concern to a necessity where as a result , 70% of managers have an affirmation that the new digital models had a great advance as a result of the pandemic\u201d. 2) Resistance to change in human resources: this concept is not new in the market, because the lack of communication between the project leaders and the areas involved is not very effective, resulting in an environment of uncertainty and doubts about what that is being done. This exclusion of the staff and not making them part of our project, makes many people resist change, being a great obstacle for our technological project. It is always essential to be aware that the new technologies that are being implemented will most likely be used by these users, but it should also be considered that our users are used to executing and carrying out processes that are well known and it is the change in their routine that generates some fear or discomfort. 3) Reduce dependence on traditional tools: for some authors, this point is the continuity of the previous one, since users know how to use the computer tools they have used for years and a new update means for them to start over from scratch. Migrating to new technological tools must mean that for the company it will bring many benefits, as well as improve the quality of life of its users. Contrary to the previous points, the benefits obtained in the digital transformation can be indicated according to (CMC, 2020):1) Faster response to changes.2) Improve the customer experience.3) Make better decisions.4) New business opportunities.5) Reduce risks.6) Increases the productivity of the company.7) It favors collaborative work.8) Promotes innovation.9) Advantage over the competition.10) Decentralization of work. The digital transformation combines three important aspects in its development, starting with an open culture, new technologies and constant processes. For the latter, they can be implemented in different ways, such as robotic process automation (RPA). For (ToBeIt, 2022), RPA \"is one of the keys to the transformation of companies since it is allowing the automation of superfluous and repetitive processes or tasks through specific rules\". With this definition, various types of services can be created that lead to 24-hour care without the need for human intervention, of course, that the objective of RPA is not to replace human resources but rather to be able to optimize tasks carried out by users, providing the opportunity for the user to carry out other activities where they involve some type of decision. The different RPA tools, some of them entail a certain degree of programming knowledge, but, however, there are others that are very friendly and/or are carried out through a natural language, making it possible for the same user to configure them and plan their execution, taking into account the following activities: 1) Security and access to the tool, through the management of credentials and the roles of each user.2) Compatibility with existing applications in the company.3) User interface, the application must be as friendly to new users as it is to experienced users. In order to implement an RPA tool, it is essential to evaluate the following aspects: 1) Identify those repetitive tasks that consume many hours of work.2) Design and parameterization of the optimized workflow.3) Planning the implementation of the RPA tool together with constant monitoring of its execution. The benefits of implementing an RPA are: 1) Realization and execution of tasks 24*7 without the need for human intervention.2) Greater efficiency between 50% and 90% of current processes.3) Time savings, since the robot is much faster than human action.4) Because it has no human intervention, it can be said that the RPA has a margin of error of 0%.5) An RPA can be implemented without the intervention of a company IT team. According to the magic square of Garther 2021 \"estimates that 85% of companies with revenues greater than 1,000 million dollars will have deployed RPA by the end of the year 2022, a percentage that at the end of 2018 was 60%\". Another very important fact is that a study by (Hidalgo, 2022) indicates that \"in 2021, the business volume linked to this technology has been approximately $2B and an exponential growth of the RPA market is expected until it reaches a volume of 13.4B$ in the year 2030\u201d. This information tells us that many companies are investing in RPA due to the benefits that they imply. In a report generated in (flobotics-io, 2022) it indicates that \"the use of RPA in industries, 38% is insurance companies, 36% is retail and hospitality, 30% is energy companies and utilities, with the same percentage is in health care companies, 24% in banking and financial entities and finally with 22% in pharmaceutical industries and others\u201d. The types of companies not mentioned, have a low percentage of participation, but little by little they are increasing to adapt to this type of technology. In a survey issued by Deloitte, 92% indicated that RPA met or exceeded their expectations while 90% indicated that they had improved quality/accuracy, 86% improved productivity, and 59% indicated that they had a reduction in cost. costs. Another important piece of information is that 78% of companies that have implemented RPA expect to significantly increase their investment in RPA over the next three years. There is another very important statistic where it finds that 63% of companies plan to engage with an RPA implementation partner, while 19% plan to use RPA vendors for support and 15% will handle RPA internally. Finally, I can conclude that the inclusion of RPA in the digital transformation is very important for the competitive advantages that a company can have, since with it they manage to optimize their resources and generate great business opportunities, without forgetting the new services that a company can provide to its customers to improve the experience and satisfaction of this.",

    "title": "Respect for Evidence: Can Science Education Deliver It?",
    "abstract": "In the short span of a year, numerous vaccines have been developed by various scientific research teams across the world. We cannot acknowledge enough the countless scientists who have been working tirelessly to develop drugs as well as vaccines to combat COVID19. If it wasn\u2019t for these scientists\u2019 respect for evidence, regardless of whose evidence and from where, it is difficult to imagine how the world would have coped with no reliable vaccines a year after the emergence of the pandemic. Even though the pandemic context has put the interplay of science with economics and politics on display, illustrating the tensions in how scientific knowledge may be interpreted in and for public consumption, it is important to highlight that \u201cscience\u201d can still serve humanity at a time of public health crisis thanks to the great value it places in generating, evaluating, and using evidence. Scientific evidence rests on objectivity, as contested a definition this concept may invite (Longino, 1990; Needham, 2020). Imagine what vaccine research would look like if it were guided by accounts of subjective experiences of scientists of different backgrounds and identities establishing their own idiosyncratic mechanisms of COVID-19 immunity without a sense of collective critique and robust validation, where findings and conclusions are divergent on empirical adequacy and accuracy, where the language and representations are localized to the point of obscurity, and only intelligible to those who utter them. It would indeed, most likely, lead to a public health disaster. Respect for evidence is an important social value in science, relevant to the contemporary context of anti-science sentiment displayed through issues such as climate change denial but how does science education deal with such values and indeed, does and can science education actually instill respect for evidence? There is research in science education on student engagement with scientific evidence (McNeill & Berland, 2016) as well as accounts that indicate the possibility of belief revision in light of data (Masnick et al., 2017). However, engagement with and understanding of evidence does not necessarily guarantee respect for evidence. Respect for evidence can apply to different senses of \u201cscience education.\u201d One sense is about teaching in formal and informal contexts such as schools, museums, and other learning environments. Another sense is about science education as a domain of educational research carried out by academics, researchers, as well as teachers in different organizational settings. The question of respect for evidence can be raised in both senses. The current issue of Science & Education includes a set of papers that explicitly or implicitly embrace respect for evidence, whether this is embedded",

    "title": "Advances in Genome Editing With CRISPR Systems and Transformation Technologies for Plant DNA Manipulation",
    "abstract": "The year 2020 marks a decade since the first gene-edited plants were generated using homing endonucleases and zinc finger nucleases. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene-editing in 2012 was a major science breakthrough that revolutionized both basic and applied research in various organisms including plants and consequently honored with \u201cThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 2020.\u201d CRISPR technology is a rapidly evolving field and multiple CRISPR-Cas derived reagents collectively offer a wide range of applications for gene-editing and beyond. While most of these technological advances are successfully adopted in plants to advance functional genomics research and development of innovative crops, others await optimization. One of the biggest bottlenecks in plant gene-editing has been the delivery of gene-editing reagents, since genetic transformation methods are only established in a limited number of species. Recently, alternative methods of delivering CRISPR reagents to plants are being explored. This review mainly focuses on the most recent advances in plant gene-editing including (1) the current Cas effectors and Cas variants with a wide target range, reduced size and increased specificity along with tissue specific genome editing tool kit (2) cytosine, adenine, and glycosylase base editors that can precisely install all possible transition and transversion mutations in target sites (3) prime editing that can directly copy the desired edit into target DNA by search and replace method and (4) CRISPR delivery mechanisms for plant gene-editing that bypass tissue culture and regeneration procedures including de novo meristem induction, delivery using viral vectors and prospects of nanotechnology-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "One of the subject areas that is currently most prominent in the field of education (Social Science) is climate change, given its implications for raising awareness and training the present and future society. The objectives of this study, focused on school children (Primary Education\u201410 to 12 years old; third cycle, Secondary Education\u201412\u201316 years old; and pre-university, Baccalaureate\u201417\u201318 years old) in the Region of Valencia (Spain), are to analyse the following: the main information channels through which children receive information on climate change; the causes and consequences that they identify with respect to this phenomenon; and the main greenhouse gas that they believe is in the atmosphere. Based on the 575 students surveyed during the academic year 2020\u20132021, the results indicate that the three main information media are digital (TV\u201482.8%, Internet\u201456.2% and social networks\u201449.4%). With respect to the causes of the phenomenon identified by the students, particularly noteworthy was pollution (70.1%) and, in terms of the effects, the increase and changes in temperature (61.7%) were of particular note. Finally, with reference to greenhouse gases, the majority responded CO2 (63.5%). This is incorrect, as the main greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is water vapour. To sum up, we can highlight the role played by schools in training the future society and the risk arising from an increase in the information received from digital media by children as they grow older, due to the danger of misinformation.",

    "title": "Impact of Extending DAA Availability in France: A Five-Year Overview (2015-2019) of Data From French Administrative Healthcare Databases (SNDS)",
    "abstract": "Background: Direct antiviral agents (DAAs) became available in France in 2014 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in patients with severe fibrosis (prioritized access); in 2017, DAAs became available to all CHC patients (universal access). We evaluated the impact of extending DAA availability on CHC patient care, especially on screening and time to treatment.\u00a0 \n \nMethods: Adult patients affiliated with the national health insurance system (SNDS) who were screened or treated for CHC between 2015 and 2019 were included. Algorithms were developed to identify at-risk subpopulations.\u00a0 \n \nFindings: The proportion of screened patients increased by 1% between 2015 and 2019, from 4\u00b76% to 5\u00b76%. The main nonexclusive risk factors for CHC were psychiatric conditions (27%), drug use (21%) and HIV positivity (11%); more than 50% of psychiatric patients had additional risk factors, mainly drug use with a 38% to 52% overlap.\u00a0 \n \nThe median interval between the last screening test and treatment initiation decreased from 64 days in 2015 to 37 days in 2019.\u00a0 \n \nDuring the study period, 71,466 patients began CHC treatment (median age 55 [48-62]; 59% male), including 46% of \u201cat-risk\u201d patients with an increase in treatment initiation by 44% between 2015 and 2017 and a decrease of 46% between 2017 and 2019. Only 2,212 (3%) patients were treated at least twice.\u00a0 \n \nAmong treated patients, the proportion of HIV+ patients decreased from 19% to 8% (prioritization consequence), while the proportions increased in the other at-risk subpopulations. \n \nInterpretation: Policies extending DAA availability are associated with a screening increase and a decrease in the time to treatment initiation. Universal access led to a surge in treatment initiations in 2017. This study may contribute to improving the cascade of care in the at-risk subpopulations, for instance by pointing to the importance of the psychiatric subpopulation. \n \nFunding Information: This study was funded by Gilead Sciences. \n \nDeclaration of Interests: Stanislas Pol has received consulting and lecturing fees from Janssen, Gilead, MSD, Abbvie, Biotest, Shinogui, Viiv, LFB and grants from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead, Roche and MSD. \n \nFrancoise Roudot-Thoraval has received consulting and lecturing fees from Gilead and AbbVie. \n \nMagali Lemaitre: Employee at IQVIA, commissioned by Gilead Sciences to access the SNDS database and perform the analysis. \n \nFayssoil Fouad: employee at IQVIA, commissioned by Gilead Sciences to access the SNDS database and perform the analysis. \n \nIngrid Rodriguez: employee at Gilead Sciences \n \nOlivier Lada: employee at Gilead Sciences \n \nPascaline Rabiega: employee at IQVIA, commissioned by Gilead Sciences to access the SNDS database and perform the analysis \n \nElias Benabadji: employee at Gilead Sciences \n \nEthics Approval Statement: CNIL authorization for the corresponding research dated January 31, 2020 (DR-2020-053), and CEREES authorization for the corresponding research, dated 10/19/2017,",

    "title": "High School Students\u2019 Perceptions towards COVID-19 Vaccination: Benefits, Barriers and Influencing Factors",
    "abstract": "After the outbreak of the Corona pandemic and its conquest of the world, it became necessary to find a vaccine against the Corona virus in order to break the cycle of its spread, but the acceptance or rejection of the vaccination by the citizens may be affected by the mental and representational maps that have stuck to the epidemic through the emergence of several trends. Some researchers have observed that the large population has a relatively high reluctance to current vaccinations and that vaccination coverage is not adequate (van Doremalen et al 2020; Harapan et al. 2019). In Morocco, the elderly have, it seems, readily accepted to participate in the vaccination campaign launched by the government. But what is the attitude of young people towards vaccination against COVID 19? This study aims to understand the perceptions towards the COVID-19 vaccination and the targeted subject is the high school students (17-18 years old). The research used five-point Likert scale instruments to examine student\u2019s perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccination. The sample for this analysis is N=263 participants. Through the analysis that targeted the students\u2019 answers about the advantages of vaccination, it was found that vaccination against the Corona virus has several advantages for students of the second year of the baccalaureate, as both scientific and literary students acknowledge that it combats the disease, but the percentage of importance varies from scientific to literary. Statistics from both categories of students indicated that literary people consider the vaccine against the Corona virus to be ineffective, while scientists do not. The results also showed that there are more risks of unwanted negative side effects than benefits. Statistics have also shown that among the obstacles that would prevent students from getting vaccinated against the virus, in addition to fear of the vaccine, doubt about its safety. Both science and literary students indicated that the school, the free vaccination, the media, the Internet, and the family are some important factors that may affect students' receipt of the vaccination. The comparison between the two groups of students showed that there are no significant differences between the students regarding the COVID-19 vaccination process, and from this we can assume that the information obtained by the science students did not affect their perceptions.",

    "title": "Effect of Online Science Course Supported with Web 2.0 Tools on the Academic Achievement of Fifth Grade Students and Student Opinions",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of an online science course on the academic achievement of a fifth grade \u2018World of Living\u2019 unit, which was carried out by using the materials created with web 2.0 tools, as well as to determine the students' opinions about the application. This study consisted of a total of 120 fifth grade students studying in state schools in Istanbul during the academic year of 2020-2021. In determining the study group, purposeful sampling methods were used. In the experimental group (n = 60), the course was taught with web 2.0 supported materials; in the control group (n = 60), instruction was made by adhering to the activities in the textbook. The research was carried out by making use of mixed method research. A quantitative quasi-experimental model with pretest and posttest control groups was used. In the qualitative dimension, opinions were obtained from the students after the application. In the study, semi-structured interview form and academic achievement test prepared for the unit of the world of living things were used as data collection tools. While the data obtained from the students to the achievement test before and after the application was transferred to a statistical package program and analyzed; the data obtained from the interview form were analyzed using content analysis. When the posttest academic achievement score data obtained from the students were compared as a result of the study, it was found that there was a significant difference in favor of the experimental group. In addition, results from the interviews, revealed that students found science teaching with web-supported materials fun and enjoyable and that they wanted these to be used in science lessons. As a result of this study, it is recommended that web 2.0 tools be used by educators in science education.",

    "abstract": "After the development of deep learning and computer music, there is more and more electronic music composed by computers and algorithms. However, there are very few projects for violin etudes created based on artificial intelligence. In 2020, The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra Concert Hall hosted a special concert of Mozart's 80-year-old works, the last three symphonic pieces were generated by the AI based on learning a large amount of Mozart's past music, which inspire me. In this paper, classical violin etude (i.e., Rudolphe Kreutzer 42 Studies) is used for the data. Based on several studies, the LSTM model is the framework of this study. In the multiple times of changing seeds and temperature, the creation demo has creativity and similarity, but with less education. The educational meaning is also the future research to focus on. This study makes a step in making violin etudes from the classical violin etudes, which can create new etudes for future violin players. Moreover, the new etudes shed light on Inheriting and innovating the predecessors' composing style and thinking.",

Cosmic evolution, the structure of matter, the origins of life, and understanding how the brain works all deserve strengthened support, according to China's latest 5-year development plan, which could triple funding for basic research by 2020. An outline of the plan, which covers 2016 through 2020, received pro forma approval by the National People's Congress on 16 March at its closing session. Though details are still scarce, one expectation is that funding for basic research will rise to 10% of total R&D spending by 2020, up from less than 5% now. If the 10% goal is achieved, investment in basic research could hit 225 billion yuan, or about $34.5 billion, in 2020, compared with last year's $10 billion.",

    "abstract": "Many studies point to the difficulty of scaling existing computer architectures to meet the needs of an exascale system (i.e., capable of executing $10^{18} $ floating-point operations per second), consuming no more than 20 MW in power, by around the year 2020. This paper outlines a new architecture, the Active Memory Cube, which reduces the energy of computation significantly by performing computation in the memory module, rather than moving data through large memory hierarchies to the processor core. The architecture leverages a commercially demonstrated 3D memory stack called the Hybrid Memory Cube, placing sophisticated computational elements on the logic layer below its stack of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) dies. The paper also describes an Active Memory Cube tuned to the requirements of a scientific exascale system. The computational elements have a vector architecture and are capable of performing a comprehensive set of floating-point and integer instructions, predicated operations, and gather-scatter accesses across memory in the Cube. The paper outlines the software infrastructure used to develop applications and to evaluate the architecture, and describes results of experiments on application kernels, along with performance and power projections.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to examine the relationship between the levels of prospective preschool teachers\u2019 self-efficacy beliefs in science education and learning styles. In this study, the correlational survey model was used. The sample of the research was composed of 193 (165 females, 28 males) prospective pre-school teachers studying in their first, second, third, and fourth year in a faculty of education of a state university located in the Black Sea in Turkey. Data were collected using the \u2018Science Education Self-Efficacy Belief Scale\u2019 developed by Riggs and Enochs (1990) and adapted into Turkish by \u00d6zkan et al. (2002) and \u2018Kolb Learning Style Inventory\u2019 developed by Kolb (1984) and adapted into Turkish by Evin Gencel (2007) in the spring semester of the 2019-2020 academic year. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in the statistical calculations of the data in the study. As a result of the study, it was determined that these prospective pre-school teachers\u2019 self-efficacy beliefs in science education were very high while their personal self-efficacy beliefs and result expectation sub-dimensions were at a high level. In addition, there is no statistically significant difference between prospective teachers' self-efficacy beliefs in science education, personal self-efficacy perception, and result expectation according to their learning styles. Based on the results obtained, to increase the success of prospective teachers in science and achieve desired goals in education, learning environments should be designed according to learning styles, and studies should be conducted to increase the quality of science education by making use of self-efficacy beliefs.",

    "title": "Resurgence of SARS-CoV-2: Detection by community viral surveillance",
    "abstract": "Community virus surveillance Even highly effective vaccines will not save us from the need to monitor severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) activity, perhaps for years to come. Public health institutions will need early warning of any uptick in cases to prepare and deploy interventions as required. Riley et al. developed a community-wide program that was designed to detect resurgence at low prevalence and has been used to track SARS-CoV-2 virus across England. In the four rounds of sampling from May to September 2020, almost 600,000 people representative of all communities were monitored. The results revealed the greatest prevalence among 18- to 24-year-olds, with increasing incidence among older age groups and elevated odds of infection among some communities. This testing approach offers a model for the type of real-time, country-wide population-based surveillance work that needs to be conducted to monitor SARS-CoV-2. Science, abf0874, this issue p. 990 Representative community antigen sampling can improve situational awareness and help evaluate interventions at low SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Surveillance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has mainly relied on case reporting, which is biased by health service performance, test availability, and test-seeking behaviors. We report a community-wide national representative surveillance program in England based on self-administered swab results from ~594,000 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, between May and the beginning of September 2020. The epidemic declined between May and July 2020 but then increased gradually from mid-August, accelerating into early September 2020 at the start of the second wave. When compared with cases detected through routine surveillance, we report here a longer period of decline and a younger age distribution. Representative community sampling for SARS-CoV-2 can substantially improve situational awareness and feed into the public health response even at low prevalence.",

    "abstract": "The Global Justice Index is a multiyear research project based at Fudan Institute for Advanced Study in Social Sciences that assesses the contributions made by each country to achieving greater global justice. We have published results from 2010 to 2019 in Global Justice Index Report, Global Justice Index Report 2020, Global Justice Index Report 2021, and we are now presenting our fourth-year results for 2020 in Global Justice Index Report 2022, which is an updated version of previous years\u2019 reports. This year, we take into account changes to global justice influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The report consists of four sections: introduction, findings, main results, and conclusion. In the introduction, we discuss the development of the conceptual framework and evaluative principles to justify our selection of the dimensions and indicators for measurement. Next, in the findings section, we report the data, indicators, and our results for each country for each of the 10 issues we identify, and provide regional comparisons for Asia, Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and Oceania. In the following section, we present the main results for the global justice indices, and report the ranking of each country\u2019s contribution to achieving greater global justice. In the final section, we discuss the applications and limitations of the index and potential further research trajectories.",

    "title": "ASSOCIATION OF HUSBAND SUPPORT AND POSTPARTUM BLUES IN POSTPARTUM WOMEN : SYSTEMATIC REVIEW",
    "abstract": "Background: Postpartum women have a number of difficulties in the early postpartum phase if they are not given social assistance. Programs for postpartum education are necessary to support postpartum women's mental health. \nAims: This systematic review is to review the association of husband supports and the cases of postpartum blues in postpartum women. \nMethods: By comparing itself to the standards set by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020, this study was able to show that it met all of the requirements. So, the experts were able to make sure that the study was as up-to-date as it was possible to be. For this search approach, publications that came out between 2014 and 2024 were taken into account. Several different online reference sources, like Pubmed, ScienceDirect and SagePub, were used to do this. It was decided not to take into account review pieces, works that had already been published, or works that were only half done. \nResult: In the PubMed database, the results of our search brought up 350 articles, whereas the results of our search on SAGEPUB brought up 4759 articles, our search on SCIENCE DIRECT brought up 7069 articles. The results of the search conducted for the last year of 2014 yielded a total 16 articles for PubMed, 1354 articles for SAGEPUB and 2516 articles for SCIENCE DIRECT. In the end, we compiled a total of 6 papers, 2 of which came from PubMed, 1 of which came from SAGEPUB and 3 of which came from SCIENCE DIRECT. We included six research that met the criteria. \nConclusion:\u00a0In summary, there is association of husband supports and the cases of postpartum blues in postpartum women. Husband involvement in prenatal care seems to be able to reduce the incidence of postpartum blues but may possibly increase the couples\u2019 intimacy. Therefore, it can be suggested that midwives consider husband involvement in prenatal care.",

    "abstract": "We present the \u201cAI-Atlas\u201d didactic concept as a coherent set of best practices for teaching Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to a technical audience in tertiary education, and report on its implementation and evaluation within a design-based research framework and two actual courses: an introduction to AI within the final year of an undergraduate computer science program, as well as an introduction to ML within an interdisciplinary graduate program in engineering. The concept was developed in reaction to the recent AI surge and corresponding demand for foundational teaching on the subject to a broad and diverse audience, with on-site teaching of small classes in mind and designed to build on the specific strengths in motivational public speaking of the lecturers. The research question and focus of our evaluation is to what extent the concept serves this purpose, specifically taking into account the necessary but unforeseen transfer to ongoing hybrid and fully online teaching since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our contribution is two-fold: besides (i) presenting a general didactic concept for tertiary engineering education in AI and ML, ready for adoption, we (ii) draw conclusions from the comparison of qualitative student evaluations (n = 24\u201330) and quantitative exam results (n = 62\u2013113) of two full semesters under pandemic conditions with the result of previous years (participants from Zurich, Switzerland). This yields specific recommendations for the adoption of any technical curriculum under flexible teaching conditions\u2014be it on-site, hybrid, or online.",

    "title": "The Quality of Tasks in Learning Assessment: The Perspective of Law Students",
    "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: One of the essential components of the learning evaluation dimension is the quality of the tasks used by teachers to evaluate and rate student performance. Some of their characteristics linked to their relevance to achieve the transfer of knowledge is that they are relevant, challenging, realistic and contextualized in such a way that they favor depth in knowledge and communication. For Boud, D. (2020), assessment in higher education is undergoing a significant change, moving from an approach focused on comparison between students (norm-referenced assessment) towards a standards-based system that judges performance based on of pre-established criteria. This change is accompanied by an expansion of the purposes of evaluation, transcending the simple certification of students to encompass objectives such as the promotion of learning, the development of skills and the capacity for self-assessment. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the quality of learning evaluation tasks based on the dimensions: Challenge, Depth, Communication and Transfer; as well as determining whether the sex, semester and grade average of the students are factors associated with the evaluations that students make of the quality of the evaluation of the tasks assigned by the professors. METHOD: E An empirical investigation of an explanatory and transversal nature was carried out; through a non-probabilistic convenience sampling in which 177 students from the law school of a private university in Mexico participated. The dependent variable under study was: The quality of the learning evaluation tasks that teachers use to assign grades to their students and the independent variables were sex, progress in the degree, type of school year and grade point average qualifications in the race. INSTRUMENT: The questionnaire called: Analysis of Evaluation and Learning Tasks (ATAE) developed by Ibarra-Saiz, M.S. and Rodr\u00edguez-G\u00f3mez, G. (2020 B) that evaluates the quality of the Assessment Tasks defined as an activity designed with the purpose of collecting information on the ability of students to apply and use their competencies, knowledge, abilities and skills when address the resolution of complex problems and be able to verify the degree of achievement of the expected learning results. The ATAE questionnaire is structured in four dimensions and consists of 16 items in a scale format from 0 to 10 distributed in each of the following dimensions: Challenge, refers to addressing open and complex problems that require divergent thinking, creativity and the establishing meaningful connections; Depth that involves demonstrating deep understanding through the use of methods of inquiry and reflective and critical thinking. Communication, this is using oral, written or symbolic communication strategies, through presentations, performances or products based on substantiated argumentation. Transfer, involves relating knowledge and experience with other subjects and with social and professional reality. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: (1) Students perceive the quality of the tasks for the evaluation of learning as Good (8). (2) Among the students as a whole, it is identified that there is little homogeneity regarding the perception they have about the quality of the learning evaluation tasks (Ds =1.78) (3) Most of the students 112/177 consider that the quality is equal to or less than 7. (4) Make the tasks to evaluate learning CHALLENGING, this is the dimension with the greatest opportunity for improvement (5) Null hypothesis (Ho) is approved for sex, type of school year, career advancement and career grade average regarding the quality of the learning evaluation tasks and their dimensions: Depth, Communication, Challenging and Transfer, that is say there are no significant differences. IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS: (1) Improve the quality of learning assessment tasks in relation to: - Quality of tasks: Depth, challenging, communication and transfer of learning (See Table 2) - Alignment with learning objectives. - Homework must be fair and equitable for all students. - Students should receive constructive and timely feedback on their performance on assignments. To guide the design of the tasks, it is suggested to use an appropriate framework such as the Task Quality Assessment Framework (TQF), the Instructional Design Assessment Framework (IDD) or the Equity and Justice Framework Evaluation (EFA). These frameworks provide criteria and guidelines for designing assignments that are high quality, aligned with learning objectives, equitable, and that provide useful feedback to students. (2) Systematize the teacher-student relationship in formative assessment by adopting the guidelines for providing feedback to students on their academic work (See Annex 1) and the guidelines on effective feedback (See Annex 2) (3) Implement the case method using the guide proposed for this purpose (See Annex 3). This will contribute to defining a style of professional training and teaching based on the homologation of the teaching-learning activities carried out by teachers in the different dimensions of teaching competence: didactic planning, teaching and learning evaluation. (4) Define didactic projects for the systematization of the preparation of legal documents, simulation of oral trials and training in values. (5) Evaluate the law program in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and quality based on performance standards. For this purpose, it is pertinent to conceive the curriculum as an educational project in which the expected learning, contents, methodology and evaluation of learning were defined. This implies defining a program evaluation system.

    "title": "Predictors of Insomnia and Sleep Abnormalities in Medical Students and Its Impact on Academic Performance",
    "abstract": "\n \n \n This study aims to investigate predictors of insomnia and their prevalence among medical students from different levels, as well as the impact of insomnia on academic performance.\n \n \n \n This multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted on medical students of different levels at 37 medical colleges in Saudi Arabia from March 2020 to June 2020. An online survey was used for data collection. The survey included questions on the demographics of students and two scales: the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Program was used to analyze the data, and demographics were represented using descriptive statistics. Associations were tested using either the Chi-square test, Pearson correlation, or Spearman\u2019s correlation based on the types of variables. P <0.05 was considered significant.\n \n \n \n The study included 2413 medical students; the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of the ISI and PSQI was 11.6 \u00b1 6.2 and 8.4 \u00b1 3.7, respectively. The ISI results showed that only 27% had no clinical insomnia, while 39% had subthreshold insomnia. The ISI was negatively and significantly associated with exercise (r = \u22120.49, P = 0.016), meals (r = \u22120.088, P = 0.0001), and drinking water (r = \u22120.057, P = 0.005). The negative predictors of poor sleep quality included study year (B = \u22120.106, P < 0.05) and water intake (B = \u22120.568, P < 0.01).\n \n \n \n A few proportions of medical students complained of moderate insomnia, and a lower proportion suffered severe insomnia. Lower academic performance was associated with insomnia and poor sleep quality. Various predictors of insomnia were identified; however, these predictors can be modified.\n",

    "abstract": "The survey was conducted before the war (before October 2020) in Tigray Regional State, Ethiopia. Indigenous (102 Begait, 106 Hassan and 181 Arado) goat respondents and sheep respondents (126 Begait, 37 Rutanna and 90 Arado) were randomly involved in the head to head interview. Statistical Package for Social Sciences, index ranking and mathematical formulas were used for data analysis. The objective of this survey was to assess flock dynamics, production challenges and opportunities of indigenous goat and sheep populations. Very limited numbers of goat respondents (17% of Begait, 1% of Hassan and 6% of Arado) and sheep respondents (5% of Begait and 7% of Arado) were female headed households. Goat respondents of about 42% of Begait, 29% of Hassan and 55% of Arado were illiterate whereas 25% of Begait, 43% of Hassan and 26% of Arado goat respondents, and 48% of Begait and 57% of Rutanna sheep respondents attended lower primary school. About half (50%) of the Arado sheep respondents were illiterate. The indigenous goat (Begait, Hassan and Arado) and sheep (Begait, Rutanna and Arado) populations were kept under low input extensive production system. Economic contributions ranking of the respondents indicated that goat, cattle and sheep were ranked first, second and third in goat survey whilst sheep, goats and cattle were ranked first, second and third in sheep survey, respectively. Indigenous goat respondents reported that the first, second, and third ranked income sources of the respondents were crop production, goat production, and cattle production, whereas crop production, sheep production, and goat production were the first, second, and third ranked income sources of the indigenous sheep respondents. The major entry in all the indigenous goat and sheep in 2017 production year was additions of newborns to the flocks. Sale and death were the first and second ranked exits in indigenous goats and sheep. Except Hassan goats (+0.1%), flock dynamics (%) in entries and exits of indigenous goat and sheep flocks were at decreasing rates which greatly damaged the economy of the respondents. Begait flock (-16.5%) and Arado flock (-16.7%) goat populations were highly decreased in 2017 production year compared to indigenous sheep flock populations. Respondents of indigenous goat (92% of Begait, 99% of Hassan and 99% of Arado) and sheep (all respondents-100%) reported production challenges and negatively affected productivity. Respondents of indigenous goat (87% of Begait, 80% of Hassan and 38% of Arado) and sheep (76% of Begait, 100% of Rutanna and 53% of Arado respondents) reported production opportunities which could enhance small ruminant productivity. The first, second and third ranked challenges in the indigenous goat and sheep were rangeland scarcity, diseases and lack of veterinary services, respectively. Rangeland scarcity directly negatively affected annual reproductive rate of the indigenous goat and sheep of the study areas. The first, second and third ranked diseases in both goat and sheep were shipping fever, Coenuruses and Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia, respectively. The first and second ranked external parasites in both goat and sheep were ticks and fleas whilst the third ranked external parasites in goats was sore mouth and in sheep was jigger flea infestation. Therefore, the diseases, external parasites and challenges should be taken in to account in the designing of genetic improvement of the indigenous goat and sheep of the study areas. Veterinary service centers should also be accessible to all indigenous goat and sheep producers in the study areas.",

    "title": "The Quality of Tasks in Learning Assessment: The Perspective of Law Students",
    "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: One of the essential components of the learning evaluation dimension is the quality of the tasks used by teachers to evaluate and rate student performance. Some of their characteristics linked to their relevance to achieve the transfer of knowledge is that they are relevant, challenging, realistic and contextualized in such a way that they favor depth in knowledge and communication. For Boud, D. (2020), assessment in higher education is undergoing a significant change, moving from an approach focused on comparison between students (norm-referenced assessment) towards a standards-based system that judges performance based on of pre-established criteria. This change is accompanied by an expansion of the purposes of evaluation, transcending the simple certification of students to encompass objectives such as the promotion of learning, the development of skills and the capacity for self-assessment. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the quality of learning evaluation tasks based on the dimensions: Challenge, Depth, Communication and Transfer; as well as determining whether the sex, semester and grade average of the students are factors associated with the evaluations that students make of the quality of the evaluation of the tasks assigned by the professors. METHOD: E An empirical investigation of an explanatory and transversal nature was carried out; through a non-probabilistic convenience sampling in which 177 students from the law school of a private university in Mexico participated. The dependent variable under study was: The quality of the learning evaluation tasks that teachers use to assign grades to their students and the independent variables were sex, progress in the degree, type of school year and grade point average qualifications in the race. INSTRUMENT: The questionnaire called: Analysis of Evaluation and Learning Tasks (ATAE) developed by Ibarra-Saiz, M.S. and Rodr\u00edguez-G\u00f3mez, G. (2020 B) that evaluates the quality of the Assessment Tasks defined as an activity designed with the purpose of collecting information on the ability of students to apply and use their competencies, knowledge, abilities and skills when address the resolution of complex problems and be able to verify the degree of achievement of the expected learning results. The ATAE questionnaire is structured in four dimensions and consists of 16 items in a scale format from 0 to 10 distributed in each of the following dimensions: Challenge, refers to addressing open and complex problems that require divergent thinking, creativity and the establishing meaningful connections; Depth that involves demonstrating deep understanding through the use of methods of inquiry and reflective and critical thinking. Communication, this is using oral, written or symbolic communication strategies, through presentations, performances or products based on substantiated argumentation. Transfer, involves relating knowledge and experience with other subjects and with social and professional reality. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: (1) Students perceive the quality of the tasks for the evaluation of learning as Good (8). (2) Among the students as a whole, it is identified that there is little homogeneity regarding the perception they have about the quality of the learning evaluation tasks (Ds =1.78) (3) Most of the students 112/177 consider that the quality is equal to or less than 7. (4) Make the tasks to evaluate learning CHALLENGING, this is the dimension with the greatest opportunity for improvement (5) Null hypothesis (Ho) is approved for sex, type of school year, career advancement and career grade average regarding the quality of the learning evaluation tasks and their dimensions: Depth, Communication, Challenging and Transfer, that is say there are no significant differences. IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS: (1) Improve the quality of learning assessment tasks in relation to: - Quality of tasks: Depth, challenging, communication and transfer of learning (See Table 2) - Alignment with learning objectives. - Homework must be fair and equitable for all students. - Students should receive constructive and timely feedback on their performance on assignments. To guide the design of the tasks, it is suggested to use an appropriate framework such as the Task Quality Assessment Framework (TQF), the Instructional Design Assessment Framework (IDD) or the Equity and Justice Framework Evaluation (EFA). These frameworks provide criteria and guidelines for designing assignments that are high quality, aligned with learning objectives, equitable, and that provide useful feedback to students. (2) Systematize the teacher-student relationship in formative assessment by adopting the guidelines for providing feedback to students on their academic work (See Annex 1) and the guidelines on effective feedback (See Annex 2) (3) Implement the case method using the guide proposed for this purpose (See Annex 3). This will contribute to defining a style of professional training and teaching based on the homologation of the teaching-learning activities carried out by teachers in the different dimensions of teaching competence: didactic planning, teaching and learning evaluation. (4) Define didactic projects for the systematization of the preparation of legal documents, simulation of oral trials and training in values. (5) Evaluate the law program in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and quality based on performance standards. For this purpose, it is pertinent to conceive the curriculum as an educational project in which the expected learning, contents, methodology and evaluation of learning were defined. This implies defining a program evaluation system.

    "title": "Reducing Outdoor Air Pollutants through a Moss-Based Biotechnological Purification Filter in Kazakhstan",
    "abstract": "This study considers the creation of a network of moss-based biotechnological purification filters under the Smart City concept. The extent of the absorption of heavy metals and gases by Sphagnopsida moss under different conditions was investigated. The efficiency of air purification with biotechnological filters was also investigated in the city of Almaty, Republic of Kazakhstan, where an excess of the permissible concentration of harmful substances in the air, according to the WHO air quality guidelines, is recorded throughout the year. Data on the level of pollution recorded with sensors located in the largest Kazakhstani cities from 21 June 2020 to 4 June 2023 were selected as the basis for calculating purification efficiency. In total, there are 220 in 73 settlements of the Republic of Kazakhstan, with 80 such sensors located in the city of Almaty. Since creating a single biotechnological filter is expensive, our task was to calculate the air purification effect in the case of increasing the number of filters placed in polluted areas. We show that 10 filters provide an air purification efficiency of 0.77%, with 100 filters providing an air purification efficiency of 5.72% and 500 filters providing an air purification efficiency of 23.11%. A biotechnological filter for air purification based on moss was designed at Astana IT University by taking into consideration the climatic features, distribution, and types of pollution in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The obtained results are essential for ensuring compliance with the standard for environmental comfort in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Additionally, the research findings and the experience of implementing a moss-based biotechnological filter can be applied to designing similar air purification systems in other cities. This is of great importance for the advancement of the field of urban science.",

    "title": "Decreased risk of renal cell carcinoma in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sodium glucose cotransporter\u20102 inhibitors",
    "abstract": "Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at a higher risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (RCC) than the general population. In vitro and in vivo investigations of the effects of sodium glucose cotransporter\u20102 inhibitors (SGLT2I) have shown a significantly reduced risk of RCC. However, the impact of these drugs on the incidence of RCC in the human population is unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between SGLT2I use and RCC risk in patients with T2D. We undertook a nationwide retrospective cohort study using the Health and Welfare Data Science Center database (2016\u20132020). The primary outcome was the risk of incident RCC by estimating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multiple Cox regression modeling was applied to analyze the association between SGLT2I use and RCC risk in patients with T2D. In a cohort of 241,772 patients with T2D who were using SGLT2Is and 483,544 participants who were not, 220 and 609 RCC cases, respectively, were recorded. The mean follow\u2010up period of the study subjects was 2\u2009years. There was a decreased risk of RCC for SGLT2I users after adjusting for the index year, sex, age, comorbidities, and concurrent medication (adjusted HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58\u20130.81). The sensitivity test for the propensity score 1:1\u2010matched analyses showed similar results (adjusted HR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55\u20130.81). The subgroup analysis revealed consistent results for sex, age (<70\u2009years), and comorbidity with chronic kidney disease. The present study indicates that SGLT2I therapy significantly decreases RCC risk in patients with T2D. This finding was also consistent among the sensitivity test and subgroup analysis for those with or without chronic kidney disease/hypertension.",

    "title": "Campaigning for a Global Collections Network: Improving the digital representation and visibility of natural science collections from Latin America and the Caribbean",
    "abstract": "Global conservation of biodiversity is more important than ever before. The success of the Convention on Biological Diversity\u2019s Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and monitoring strategy will depend on the availability of reliable, information-rich biodiversity data. Natural science collections throughout the world are repositories for and stewards of primary biodiversity records, which they maintain and preserve in the long-term, and can contribute to biodiversity monitoring specifically at the species and genetic diversity levels.\n Accurate and up-to-date information about scientific collections as data providers and mediators lie at the core of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data (Wilkinson 2016). The visibility and discoverability provided by collections\u2019 digital representations promote an institution\u2019s, a country\u2019s and a region\u2019s wealth in biodiversity records and data; highlight human efforts and social networks for maintaining and providing access to high-quality physical and digital records; and form the basis for attribution and effective transaction managment implementing the CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics; Carroll 2021). Providing powerful functionality, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl) is evolving into the global catalog for information on collections.\n The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region is among the most biodiverse regions of the planet. Throughout the LAC region, a wealth of initiatives exists for describing, recording, protecting and managing biodiversity and biodiversity data. The region\u2019s many collections, their scientists, staff and volunteers are crucial partners in these endeavors. A diversity of local to national and regional networks are active, fostering communication, support and capacity building.\n Last year, the Biodiversity Crisis Response Committee (BCRC) of the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC) in cooperation with the GRSciColl team at GBIF, developed the concept and first materials for a Global Collections Network Campaign. In cooperation with the national GBIF Node, a pilot campaign was conducted in Ecuador. In addition, close connections were formed to the task group developing Latimer Core, TDWG\u2019s upcoming collection description standard, the MaterialSample task group of Darwin Core, as well as the community developing the next-generation data infrastructure based on the Digital Extended Specimen concept (Hardisty et al. 2022) and open FAIR digital objects (Schultes and Wittenburg 2019), e.g. defined by the openDS standard.\n Building on the pilot campaign and continuing the collaboration with the GRSciColl team, a partnership endorsed by GBIF\u2019s SPNHC node and led by two members of SPNHC\u2019s BCRC was formed that includes biodiversity scientists, collections staff and GBIF national node managers from Argentina, Ecuador and Guatemala. Supported by the GBIF Capacity Enhancement Support Programme and starting in August 2022, the partnership has the goal to increase the number, coverage and density of high quality records available through GRSciColl, thereby providing visibility and improving the recognition of natural science collections existing within the three countries and the LAC region. The CESP project contributes towards the aim of the campaign to build step by step an equitable, inclusive and engaged Global Collections Network.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of civil engineering plays a major role in determining the nation's development. Generally, geotechnical engineering has a great influence as there is a building on the ground. The facts show that there are still many geotechnical problems that arise during the development process. One of the supporting\u00a0factors in dealing with these problems is the development of research in the geotechnical sector in various fields. This research aims to determine the development of research related to Geotechnical Engineering through a bibliometric distribution map using the VOSviewer application. Data collection is gathered from the dimension site. The keyword used in this study is \"geotechnical engineering\" with the publication year of the 2017-2020 articles. This search was conducted on 23 October 2020 which resulted in 79,185 articles. The results show that the most productive writer in geotechnical research is Ronald Kerry Rowe. Moreover, China is the largest country in the field of geotechnical research so that many other countries have established cooperative relations with China. The journal that publishes the most articles on geotechnical engineering is the International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Science. As for keyword analysis, it produces bibliometric maps including network visualizations, overlay visualizations, and density visualizations. Four keywords often appear, namely \"Displacement\", \"Strength\", \"Stress\", and \"Earthquake\". Through the bibliometric approach, researchers can identify keywords on each topic or research that has been done before, it is, therefore, valuable in determining the novelty of the research that will be conducted in the future.",

    "abstract": "Background Healthcare workers are at high risk of occupational exposure to needle stick injury worldwide. Occupational exposure to needle stick injury represents the most common sources of infection such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Thus, this review aimed to determine the career time and previous one-year global pooled prevalence of occupational exposure to needle stick injury among healthcare workers. Methods The review considered articles written in English language and published from 2012 to 2020. The articles were searched using nine electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, SCOPUS, MedNar, and ScienceDirect) using a combination of Boolean logic operators (AND, OR, and NOT), Medical Subject Headings, and keywords. Quality assessment was performed to determine the relevance of the articles using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Several steps of assessment and evaluation were taken to select and analyze the relevant articles. Results The worldwide pooled prevalence of needle stick injuries among healthcare workers during career time and previous one year was 56.2% (95% CI: 47.1, 64.9) and 32.4% (95% CI: 22.0, 44.8), respectively. The career time pooled prevalence of needle stick injuries based on the socioeconomic development and study area was 54.8% and 55.1%, respectively, and one-year pooled prevalence of needle stick injury was 26.0% and 20.9%. Conclusion The review found a high prevalence of occupational exposure to needle stick injury among healthcare workers and suggests the need to improve occupational health and safety services in the healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "This research study uses a computer simulation based on real input data to examine the impact of a supercapacitor module working as a fast response energy storage unit in renewable energy systems to increase energy self-consumption and self-sufficiency. The evaluated system includes a photovoltaic system with a capacity of 3.0 kWp and between 0 and 5 supercapacitor units with a capacity of 500 F per module. The study was carried out using experimental data for electrical load, solar irradiance, and ambient temperature for the year 2020, with a 1 min temporal resolution. The daily average ambient temperature was 10.7 \u00b0C, and the daily average solar irradiance was 3.1 kWh/m2/day. It is assumed that the supercapacitor could only be charged from a photovoltaic system using renewable energy and not from the grid. The simulation results showed that using the supercapacitors to feed the short and large peaks of the electrical load significantly increases energy self-consumption and self-sufficiency. With only five supercapacitor modules, yearly energy self-sufficiency increases from 28.09% to 40.77%.",

    "abstract": "As a result of extreme modifications in human activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, the status of air quality has recently been improved. This bibliometric study was conducted on a global scale to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution, identify the emerging challenges, and discuss the future perspectives during the course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For this, we have estimated the scientific production trends between 2020 and 2021 and investigated the contributions of countries, institutions, authors, and most prominent journals metrics network analysis on the topic of COVID-19 combined with air pollution research spanning the period between January 01, 2020, and June 21, 2021. The search strategy retrieved a wide range of 2003 studies published in scientific journals from the Web of Sciences Core Collection (WoSCC). The findings indicated that (1) publications on COVID-19 pandemic and air pollution were 990 (research articles) in 2021 with 1870 citations; however, the year 2020 witnessed only 830 research articles with a large number 16,600 of citations. (2) China ranked first in the number of publications (n\u2009=\u2009365; 18.22% of the global output) and was the main country in international cooperation network, followed by the USA (n\u2009=\u2009278; 13.87% of the global output) and India (n\u2009=\u2009216; 10.78 of the total articles).

    "abstract": "Aim/Purpose: This study examined the practices, experiences, and challenges of postgraduate Library and Information Science (LIS) students in Nigeria in managing electronic documents.\n\nBackground: Many universities have transitioned from the physical to a virtual environment for both lecture and supervision since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This transition has benefits and challenges for people, especially regarding managing electronic documents. This study examined the electronic information management practices of postgraduate LIS students in Nigeria.\n\nMethodology: The population was 1,358 postgraduate students of LIS schools in Nigeria. A sample size of 309 was obtained using the Taro Yamane formula and a purposive sampling technique.\n\nContribution: There is a dearth of studies on electronic information management of postgraduate students in Nigeria. This study fills the gap. The study highlights areas of improvement and training needs of postgraduate researchers with respect to the management of electronic documents.\n\nFindings: File naming practice was poor among the respondents, as fewer than 20% always saved their files and folders by date and year. Only 14 (6.7%) always used version numbers to save documents with multiple versions, while more than 50% never did. Email boxes, flash drives, and smartphones were popular storage media among the respondents. Although the majority admitted to always or sometimes updating their antivirus and avoiding suspicious sites, about 30% do not use Virtual Private Networks (VPN), do not change their password regularly, and use the same password for different accounts. Furthermore, only 13.9% use web-based reference systems like Mendeley and Zotero to keep the documents they find online. About 90% had experienced a total loss of electronic files. File management practices were independent of gender and program level.\n\nFuture Research: The data management practices of postgraduate researchers should be examined in future studies.\n\n",

    "title": "Global prevalence of falls in the older adults: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Background With increasing life expectancy, declining mortality, and birth rates, the world's geriatric population is increasing. Falls in the older people are one of the most common and serious problems. Injuries from falls can be fatal or non-fatal and physical or psychological, leading to a reduction in the ability to perform activities of daily living. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of falls in the older people through systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the data from studies on the prevalence of falls in the older people in the world were extracted in the databases of Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), PubMed and Science Direct, and Google Scholar, Magiran and Scientific Information Database (SID) without any time limit until August 2020. To analyze the eligible studies, the stochastic effects model was used, and the heterogeneity of the studies with the I 2 index was investigated. Data analysis was conducted with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (Version 2). Results In the review of 104 studies with a total sample size of 36,740,590, the prevalence of falls in the older people of the world was 26.5% (95% CI 23.4\u201329.8%). The highest rate of prevalence of falls in the older people was related to Oceania with 34.4% (95% CI 29.2\u201340%) and America with 27.9% (95% CI 22.4\u201334.2%). The results of meta-regression indicated a decreasing trend in the prevalence of falls in the older people of the world by increasing the sample size and increasing the research year ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). Conclusion The problem of falls, as a common problem with harmful consequences, needs to be seriously considered by policymakers and health care providers to make appropriate plans for preventive interventions to reduce the rate of falls in the older people.",

    "title": "Evaluating Metrics Applied to the Medical Science Liaison (MSL) Role: A Survey-Based Study of Canadian MSL Leaders",
    "abstract": "Metrics utilized within the Medical Science Liaison (MSL) role are plentiful and traditionally quantitative. We sought to understand the current use and value of metrics applied to the MSL role, including the use of qualitative metrics. We developed a list of 70 MSL leaders working in Canada, spanning 29 companies. Invitations were emailed Jun 16, 2020 and the 25-question online survey was open for 3 weeks. Questions were designed to assess demographics as well as how and why metrics are applied to the MSL role. Data analyses were descriptive. Responses were received from 44 leaders (63%). Of the 42 eligible, 45% had \u2264 2 years of experience as MSL leaders and 86% supported specialty care products over many phases of the product lifecycle. A majority (69%) agreed or strongly agreed that metrics are critical to understanding whether an MSL is delivering value, and 98% had used metrics in the past year. The most common reason to use metrics was \u2018to show value/impact of MSLs to leadership\u2019 (66%). The most frequently used metric was \u2018number of health-care professional (HCP) interactions\u2019, despite this being seen as having moderate value. Quantitative metrics were used more often than qualitative, although qualitative were more often highly valued. The data collected show a lack of agreement between the frequency of use for some metrics and their value in demonstrating the contribution of an MSL. Overall, MSL leaders in our study felt qualitative metrics were a better means of showing the true impact of MSLs.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates text readability level investigation about biology subjects-related units in 'Science 7 Textbook'. A document analysis method was used in this study based on a qualitative research approach. The textbook, which has been used since the 2019-2020 academic year, has been selected as the study material. In the textbook, a total of 15 texts were randomly determined from two units related to biology subjects, one for each of the learning outcomes specified in the 2018 Science Course Curriculum. In calculating the readability levels of the texts, the 'Ate\u015fman Readability Formula' was used. The findings obtained as a result of the analysis showed that the overall readability levels of the texts in both units were in the 'medium difficulty' category. Furthermore, when the findings of each unit were examined on a subject basis, it was determined that the texts belonging to all of the topics included in both units (Cell and Divisions, Reproduction, Growth and Development in Living Beings) were found in the 'medium' category. These findings were interpreted as the science textbook prepared for the seventh grade for the student level in terms of readability.",

    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has a positive impact on the blended learning system, especially the synchronous and asynchronous aspects of online learning. This study aims to obtain information about how to apply the blended learning model with the STEM approach to students' scientific literacy skills during the COVID pandemic. The research method used was pre-experiment with one group pretest-posttest design. This research was conducted at SMAN 1 Bojong Gede, Bogor Regency in the academic year 2020/2021. The research sample used two class X which have been selected as purposive sampling. The instrument used in this study was a student science literacy test containing 20 question items. The data processing technique was carried out descriptively by calculating the mean and percentage of each item to obtain a description of the students' scientific literacy skills, then the data were analyzed inferentially with paired sample t-test using SPSS version 22 software, to see differences in scientific literacy before and after blended learning with the STEM approach. The results showed that in general, the average scientific literacy skills of students from the application of the blended learning model with the STEM approach had an average score of 85.50 in the good category. For students to have a better understanding of scientific literacy, students' understanding of science should be continuously trained through the blended learning model with the STEM approach.",

    "title": "Grand Challenges to Support the Freshwater Biodiversity Emergency Recovery Plan",
    "abstract": "The year 2021 offers a critical opportunity for concerted action to influence the future of freshwater biodiversity, ecosystem services and humanwell-being. TheUnitedNations Decade on Biodiversity 2011\u20132020 has ended, and governments around the world are reviewing major international agreements relevant to biodiversity conservation, including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)1, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)2, and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)3. A Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework4 is under development, with the grandmission to \u201cHalt the loss of species, ecosystems and genetic diversity by 2030; restore and recover biodiversity to ensure a world of people \u201cliving in harmony with nature\u2019 by 2050\u201d. Freshwater ecologists have acted quickly to draw attention to the global dimensions of the freshwater biodiversity crisis and address the lack of a comprehensive framework to guide policy responses (Bunn, 2016; Darwall et al., 2018). An Emergency Recovery Plan for freshwater biodiversity, published by 25 authors from 14 organizations (Tickner et al., 2020), sets out six major priorities for global action and policy development to \u201cbend the curve of freshwater biodiversity loss.\u201d It has been submitted to the working committees of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and further promoted as a dramatic OUPblog \u201cBring living waters back to our planet5\u201d Comprehensive reviews have since enumerated many research questions, actions and policy refinements needed to \u201cbend the curve\u201d and protect the world\u2019s freshwater ecosystems (van Rees et al., 2020; Buxton et al., 2021; Harper et al., 2021; Maasri et al., 2021). Each review cuts across important scientific, societal, management and policy issues. The purpose of this brief challenge paper is, likewise, to strengthen and support the Emergency Recovery Plan, but in a different way, by advocating a broader package of strategic activities that too often operate in silos, with patchy coverage of the world\u2019s freshwater ecosystem types and biogeographic diversity. This package presents traditional areas of scientific and societal activity that require more strategic, integrated and collaborative global effort to deliver evidence-based freshwater conservation outcomes, conjoined with terrestrial and estuarine/marine conservation, depending on context: (i) inventory, evaluation and research; (ii) restoration and rehabilitation; (iii) protected area design and management; and (iv) socio-ecological science and governance. The paper is intended to motivate greater interest, commitment and collaboration of all stakeholders in the most urgent and ambitious conservation enterprise of the next decade\u2014to protect and sustain freshwater biodiversity in the socio-ecological systems of the Anthropocene.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this research was to examine the information-seeking behaviour of College of Education Gindiri practicum students. The study used a descriptive survey approach and polled a sample of 340 students completing fieldwork as part of their teacher preparation for the 2020/21 school year. Data were obtained using a standardized, closed-ended questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale, and participants were selected using a purposeful random sample procedure. We used SPSS version 26 to classify and analyse the data we gathered, and our cutoff for acceptance was set at a mean score of 3.0. The study\u2019s findings showed that preservice teachers looked for information for both academic and teaching practice purposes; they accessed this information via lecture notes and course materials, the internet, libraries, seminars/workshops, and personal collections; their information resources came in the form of textbooks, journals, newspapers/magazines, and internet/PDF; and they faced challenges such as a lack of reliable electricity, a lack of up-to-date resources, an insufficient number of computers, and an inexperienced faculty. Among the many suggestions made was that library patrons be encouraged to make use of CD-ROM, radio, and television resources; that the library\u2019s information resources be kept current with the needs of library patrons; that high-speed internet access be provided; and that a reliable power source be established.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the potential of workplace edible gardens in promoting food self-provisioning (FSP) and in helping enhance food security in the Philippines. In 2017, an urban edible garden or Oh My Gulay! Sa FNRI (OMG) was set up in front of the Department of Science and Technology\u2013Food and Nutrition Research Institute (DOST-FNRI) Building to showcase the concept of an urban garden in a workplace. This is an example of FSP in the workplace. The study used primary and secondary data. Primary data included OMG vegetable volume harvested from 2018\u20132022 and the garden\u2019s land area. Secondary data were the national vegetable volume harvested and area from the Philippine Statistics Office (PSA). The characteristics and practices of OMG were also used to measure the OMG\u2019s productivity (yield and number of servings produced). The productivity of OMG was compared to the national productivity of 34 vegetable crops in the Philippines (PSA 2018\u20132022), except for 2020. The results demonstrate that an FSP in the workplace setting like OMG can provide adequate quantity to supply the vegetable recommendation for five adult individuals, following the WHO/FAO recommendation of consuming 400 g/d or 146 kg per adult individual per year of fruits and vegetables or a family composed of two adults and two children following the WHO/FAP recommendation of 1,300 g/d of fruits and vegetables. In addition, for every 71 m2 of land cultivated in a manner similar to the OMG, it can sustain an adult's vegetable needs for an entire year. Furthermore, with a larger area of 397 m2, the OMG garden can adequately supply a family with sufficient vegetables for a year, thereby showcasing its capacity to contribute to long-term food security at the household level. Study results provide evidence regarding workplace food provisioning to help address food insecurity in the country.",

    "abstract": "The results of field studies on the impact of applying organic and organo-mineral amendments on the dynamics of CO2 emissions during the growing season of grain corn and the content of organic carbon in the soil are described. A long-term (since 1989) small-plot experiment was conducted on podzolized low-humus heavy loamy chernozem on loess-like loam (Luvic Chernic Phaeozem) in the experimental farm of the National Scientific Center \"Institute for soil science and agrochemistry research named after O.\u00a0N.\u00a0Sokolovsky\u201d in the Kharkiv region in the conditions of the Left Bank Forest-Steppe. The experimental options include the composition, method, and doses of organic and organo-mineral amendments developed on the basis of leonardite with the addition of bentonite, molasses, and iron sulfate (and nitroammofoska in the organo-mineral) - 30 and 60 kg/ha in terms of nitrogen content. During the growing seasons of 2020 and 2021, we studied the seasonal dynamics of the following soil parameters: carbon dioxide emission intensity; organic carbon content; moisture content; temperature. Weather data taken from a weather station. CO2 emission measurements were carried out 4 times each year during the growing season using a portable testo 535 gas analyzer with isolation from atmospheric air. Within the arable layer (0-20\u00a0cm), the following were determined: the content of organic carbon in the soil by the oxidimetric method, the moisture content by the gravimetric method; the soil temperature measured with a Savinov thermometer. The results of the research have established a clear seasonal dynamics of the soil's ability to produce CO2 (from 0.1 to 2.0 kg/ha per hour) with a maximum in the spring and a gradual weakening by autumn, which is explained by the influence of weather conditions and the soil microclimate. A predictive model of the dependence of the intensity of CO2 emissions on the parameters of soil temperature and humidity is proposed. Compared to seasonal changes in CO2 emissions, the differences caused by the use of the two types of amendments are much smaller and manifest themselves mainly during the first half of the corn-growing season. The highest CO2 emission is with local application of organic amendment at a dose of 30 kg N/ha.The application of organic and organo-mineral amendment had a positive effect on the accumulation of organic carbon in the soil.The most effective method was recognized as the local method of applying a granular organo-mineral amendmentwith a C/N ratio of 5, in which the level of CO2 emission slows down compared to an organic amendment, and the total organic carbon content of the soil is the highest compared to other experimental options.It has been proven that carbon sequestration by soil, in addition to hydrothermal environmental conditions, is influenced by the composition and method of amendment, which can serve as a recommendation for the practical use of land improvement and fertilization agents in agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Background: The present investigation entitled \u201cEffect of medium type of varieties and organic sources of nutrients on growth, yield and economics of Kabuli Chickpea (Cicer kabulium L.) under Bundelkhand region\u2019\u2019 was carried out at the Organic Research Farm at Karguaji, Institute of Agricultural Sciences Bundelkhand University, Jhansi U.P. India, during Rabi season of the year 2020-21. \nMethods: The experiment was laid out in a factorial randomized block design with three organic sources of nutrients such as, Farm yard manure, Vermicompost and Poultry manure and comprising three varieties viz Pusa-1053, Shubhra and Ujjaval replicated thrice. All the organic sources and sowing methods significantly influence the all parameters like growth parameters viz., plant height, root length, number of primary branches, number of secondary branches per plant at 30, 60 and 90 days after sowing and at maturity, fresh shoot weight, fresh root weight, dry shoot weight and dry root weight per plan, crop growth rate g/m2 /day-1 and moisture % were noticed at 30, 60 and 90 days after sowing. \nResults: The nutrients management through organic source and different varieties significantly influenced the entire yield attributes viz, number of pod plant-1, pod weight plant-1, grain weight plant-1 and 100 seed weight were recorded with V1- PUSA-1053 and Nutrient sources M2- Vermicompost while M1- FYM and V2- Shubhra variety recorded lowest in all the parameters. Maximum seed yield per hector were also obtained through higher seed yield (25.43 kg/ha) was recorded in variety 1\u2013 (Pusa 1053) and higher seed yield (22.12 kg/ha) was found in M2 (Vermicompost application), respectively. From the present investigation, it can be concluded that above nutrients management through organic manures (vermicompost) and varieties PUSA-1053 resulted in better growth, higher yield attributes and better yield besides enhanced soil health as evident by post-harvest soil fertility status. It can be suggested as a cost effective combination for getting higher yield with greater quality of kabuli chickpea on organic farming system for the farmer\u2019s Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh.",

    "title": "Editorial: Technological Frontiers in Dinosaur Science Mark a New Age of Opportunity for Early Career Researchers",
    "abstract": "Implementation of innovative techniques and methodologies is currently fundamental to better understand and improve our knowledge of extinct faunas, like those of the dinosaurs. Today, dinosaur science is experiencing a revolution thanks to these innovative techniques that stem from multiple scientific disciplines (Figure 1). In fact, young researchers are taking the lead in research with new scientific approaches (e.g. Falkingham et al., 2018; Lefebvre et al., 2020; Manafzadeh and Gatesy, 2020; Bailleul et al., 2021; Nieto et al., 2021; Serrano-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2021; Van Bijlert et al., 2021;Ma et al., 2022; Wiemann et al., 2022). Young scientists are the key to bringing new perspectives into science and pushing technological and methodological developments. By publishing this collection we wanted to showcase this, and present high-impact scientific projects mainly developed by worldwide young researchers in vertebrate palaeontology. The innovative approaches presented in this volume will, not only advance palaeontological knowledge but also provide new tools to all vertebrate palaeontologists, since working protocols and tasks can be easier and faster to carry on with these techniques. One impressive example is the implementation of deep learning algorithms when automating image processing, like in the labelling and segmentation of computed tomography images or when osteohistological features need to be identified. Yu et al. analyze how deep neural networks can efficiently segment protoceratopsian dinosaur fossils, which can save significant time from current manual segmentation. In the case of the implementation of deep neural network-based methods, Quin et al. have tested this technique for getting segmented maps with different osteon regions on a histological dataset from various taxa within alvarezsaurian theropods. These works set an important base for analyzing larger sets of images and samples, but also developing more complex deep learning algorithms. It is a fact that the use of 3D models in descriptive studies and for soft tissue reconstructions is growing exponentially year after year. One really nice example is the partial ankylosaur skull from the mid-Cretaceous of Queensland (Australia), which Frauenfelder et al. have digitized by synchrotron radiation X-ray tomography and then reconstructed in 3D to facilitate the virtual preparation of the separate cranial bones. Although encased in a limestone concretion, thanks to this technique the palatal anatomy of Australian ankylosaurs has been elucidated, being indeed an important element in resolving ankylosaur phylogenetic relationships. It is essential to study well-preserved fossils when assessing anatomical features for descriptions, comparisons and phylogenetic analyses.

    "title": "Development of self-regulated learning: a longitudinal study on academic performance in undergraduate science",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Self-regulated learning (SRL) encompasses the strategies and behaviours that allow students to transform cognitive abilities into task-specific academic skills. Research in higher education has found a relationship between SRL and academic outcomes. However, whether SRL improves as students gain educational experience in undergraduate science has not been adequately studied. It is also unclear whether traditionally strong predictors of academic performance, such as the Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR), and science background, remain strong in the later stages of a science degree. Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate whether SRL changes over time in undergraduate science, and whether SRL, the ATAR, or a student\u2019s science background predicted their academic performance. Sample The sample comprised a cohort of agricultural science students (n = 213) from a large Australian University followed longitudinally from 2018 to 2020. Design and methods Students completed a questionnaire to assess SRL in their first and third years of undergraduate study. They also completed a knowledge survey at the start of first year to assess confidence in scientific material. Analyses revealed that students\u2019 SRL increased over the degree, but not over a single semester of first year. Additionally, it was found that students\u2019 average semester marks were related to knowledge survey scores, and with students\u2019 ATARs, but not with their SRL. Conclusion These results indicate that the academic aptitudes that contribute to academic success in high school continue to be advantageous through to the end of undergraduate study, but also suggest that students\u2019 initial scientific confidence may be particularly important to long-term university success.",

    "abstract": "This review will describe the global patterns and trends of colorectal cancer survival, using data from the population-based studies or cancer registration. We performed a systematic search of China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and SEER and collected all population-based survival studies of colorectal cancer (up to June 2020). Estimates of observed and relative survival rates of colorectal cancer by sex, period, and country were extracted from original studies to describe the temporal patterns and trends from the late 1990s to the early 21st century. Globally, 5-year observed survival rates were higher in Seoul, Republic of Korea (1993\u20131997; 56.8% and 54.3% for colon and rectum cancers, respectively), Zhejiang province (2005\u20132010; 52.9% for colon cancer), Tianjin (1991\u20131999; 52.5% for colon cancer), Shanghai (2002\u20132006; 50.0% for rectum cancer) of China, and in Japan (1993\u20131996, 59.6% for colorectal cancer). Five-year relative survival rates of colorectal cancer in the Republic of Korea (2010\u20132014), Queensland, Australia (2005\u20132012), and the USA (2005\u20132009) ranked at relatively higher positions compared to other countries. In general, colorectal cancer survival rates are improving over time worldwide. Sex disparities in survival rates were also observed in the colon, rectum, and colorectal cancers in most countries or regions. The poorest age-specific 5-year relative survival rate was observed in patients > 75 years of age. In conclusion, over the past 3 decades, colorectal cancer survival has gradually improved. Geographic variations, sex differences, and age gradients were also observed globally in colorectal cancer survival. Further studies are therefore warranted to investigate the prognostic factors of colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "The authors offer their view of popularization of science making the results of bibliometric analysis accessible via the library\u2019s website. Traditionally, research scientists want to know if their scientific publications have been referenced in reputable bibliographic databases or find out how many citations the paper generated over a given time period, or how to get the H-index, or explore more current, related research on their topic. The focus of the study was to identify information, which is not related to one user, but is required by the recipients overall. Working through the data, helps to perform ongoing evaluation of scientific institution activity. The survey was conducted among specialists of the Federal Research Center \u201cPushchino Scientific Center for Biological Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences\u201d (PSCBR RAS). After studying the information needs of scientists, there were identified the inquires noted in the largest number of questionnaires: the dynamics of publication activity sorted by year, the most productive authors, international cooperation, the most cited and funded scientific trends. The material was gathered from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases, and the results of the analysis were posted on the website of the Central Library of the Pushchino Scientific Center (Department of the Library for Natural Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences).The analysis was carried out within the framework of the PSCBR RAS works. The time period for bibliometric research is 2016\u20142020. During that period, the research activity of scientists of the PSCBR RAS covered 387 scientific areas. Bibliometric analysis showed 1139 editions where the works of researchers of the PSCBR RAS were published. The authors identified 30 the most popular journals on the subject areas of the PSCBR RAS, in which 35% of all articles were concentrated. In 2016\u20142020, scientists of PSCBR RAS together with foreign colleagues from 95 countries prepared 171 publications. According to the WoS CC and Scopus indicators, 2834 authors were registered with the affiliation of the PSCBR RAS.With respect to science communication, this paper presents findings aimed at demonstrating the achievements and contributions made by the scholars from PSCBR RAS on a global stage, thereby motivating young scientists for research activities in the Center, and getting attention in mass media.Library staff members who perform this job are able to show the highest professional performance \u2014 to acquaint readers with the practical potential of bibliometric analysis: to help find journals most appropriate for user\u2019s research; to provide information on the authors of publications based on the analysis of the number of citations of these papers for future possible joint project, to determine scientific directions that receive the most financial support. The library\u02bcs website assumes the role of an external interface to demonstrate the achievements of the PSCBR RAS.",

    "title": "A carbonate system time series in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Two years of high-frequency in-situ observations and remote sensing",
    "abstract": "The rate of ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has declined over the past decade, so a critical question for science and policy is whether the ocean will continue to act as a sink. Large areas of the ocean remain without observations for carbonate system variables, and oceanic CO2 observations have declined since 2017. The Mediterranean Sea is one such an area, especially its eastern part, where there is a paucity of carbonate system data, with large areas not sampled or only sampled by ship-based discrete measurements as opposed to high frequency, sensor-equipped time-series fixed stations. The aim of this study was to analyze a multi-year time-series of high-frequency (hourly) partial pressure CO2 (pCO2) and pH measurements in the Eastern Mediterranean, along with low-frequency (monthly) measurements of total dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity. The pCO2 time-series was the first obtained in the Eastern Mediterranean. The study was conducted at a fixed platform of the POSEIDON system (Heraklion Coastal Buoy) located near Crete Island. Temperature was the dominant factor controlling the temporal variability of pCO2 and pH, while the remaining non-thermal variability appeared to be related to evaporation, water mixing, and biological remineralization-production. The air-sea CO2 fluxes indicated a transition from a winter-spring sink period to a summer-autumn source period. The annual air-sea CO2 flux was too low (-0.16 \u00b1 0.02 mol m-2 yr-1) and variable to conclusively characterize the area as a net source or sink of CO2, highlighting the need for additional high frequency observation sites. Algorithms were developed using temperature, chlorophyll and salinity data to estimate pCO2 and total alkalinity, in an effort to provide tools for estimates in poorly observed areas/periods from remotely sensed products. The applicability of the algorithms was tested using Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) data from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (1999 to 2020) which showed that the algorithm pCO2 estimates were generally within \u00b120 \u03bcatm of the pCO2 values reported by SOCAT. Finally, the integration and analysis of the data provided directions on how to optimize the observing strategy, by readapting sensor location and using estimation algorithms with remote sensing data.",

    "abstract": "Machine translation involves the use of unnatural computer programs to translate from one language into another language without the involvement of human translators. It is not just about substituting words in one language for those in another. Machine translation involves the use of computational linguistic techniques to recognize and translate whole phrases while also considering the complex structure and figures of speech that are unique to each language.The current paper aims at casting a new light and exploring the problems of Machine Translator as an aid used by the students of translation to render from Dari into the English language.

    "title": "Impact of a self-defense and self-assertion course on self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women",
    "abstract": "Introduction & Purpose\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines violence as \u201cthe intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation\u201d (World Health Organization, 2002, p. 5). There are different types of violence: physical, somatic or bodily violence, psychological, psychic or emotional violence, sexual violence, and violence involving deprivation or neglect (World Health Organization, 2002).\nThe number of violent crimes across Austria rose by 16.9% in 2022 compared to the previous year, to 78,836 reports (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Inneres, 2023). According to Statista (2024), Austria ranked sixth out of a total of 27 European countries in terms of the relative number of people affected by rape in 2021, with women affected 9.2 times more frequently than men (37.8 vs. 4.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively). Austria ranked the same across Europe (out of 28 countries) with regard to the rate of female victims of intentional homicide, with a total of 0.98 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants (Europ\u00e4isches Institut f\u00fcr Gleichstellungsfragen, 2022).\nRobust psychological differences between women and men, so-called gender gaps, have been shown in literature. One gender gap, which has been systematically researched since the 1990s and which can still be found across cultures, is the lower self-esteem and self-confidence of girls and women compared to boys and men (Casale, 2020). This gender gap can in turn lead to inequalities in social status and salary (Righetti et al., 2020).\nPsychological characteristics again appear to play an important role in violence. Indeed, Fazzone et al. (2000) identified personal protective factors, which include characteristics such as self-confidence, self-reliance, self-motivation, flexibility, and self-assurance, against community and interpersonal violence in home health care.\nScientific studies have shown the effectiveness of self-defense courses on psychological characteristics such as self-confidence and assertiveness of participants (Brecklin, 2008; Gidycz & Dardis, 2014). In particular, most of the self-defense training programs that were analyzed showed positive changes in the measured psychological characteristics, although these results were not always consistent (Brecklin, 2008). In addition, supposed important characteristics such as self-confidence and self-assurance were not measured in the majority of cases (Brecklin, 2008). It is also worth mentioning that these older studies are mostly unpublished dissertations and, in accordance with Brecklin (2008), measures used should be revised to better fit the specific situational goals of self-defense training. This means that rather than just measuring assertiveness in everyday situations, it would be interesting to measure the likelihood of participants using assertiveness techniques in potential assault situations (Brecklin, 2008).\nThe aim of the present study was therefore to investigate possible effects of a self-defense and self-assertion course (SSC) on self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women when being put into potential assault situations.\nMethods\nA quasi-experimental study was conducted with voluntary adult female participants in a two-day SSC lasting a total of 10 hours, along with adult female controls who also took part in the study. Inclusion criteria were female gender, age \u2265 18 years, fluency in German (reading and writing), and written informed consent. Participants who had taken part in a SSC or had been practicing martial arts/ combat sports within the 3 months before or during the surveyed period were excluded from the study. The participants were asked about the effects of the SSC as well as the control period using a standardized online questionnaire that complies with the ethical standards of the Department of Sports Science at the University of Innsbruck (certificate of good standing, 25/2006). The survey was conducted at two different times: directly before the start and directly after the end of the SSC (or before and after the simultaneous control period). The questionnaire in German language, which was developed based on relevant literature (Brecklin, 2008; Kidder et al., 1983), included both quantitative and qualitative variables such as open questions. Among other things, the participants were asked to imagine themselves in situations in which they were exposed to different forms as well as intensities of violence and to indicate their level of self-confidence and self-assurance in these situations. A visual analogue scale ranging continuously from 0 (does not apply at all) to 100 (applies completely) was used for this purpose. The SSC took place in the city of Innsbruck (Austria) at various educational institutions between May 2019 and February 2020. The program of the SSC was standardized and included physical defense techniques such as punching, pushing, and kicking techniques (~15%), protective postures, and liberation techniques (~50%), as well as theoretical inputs, exercises for setting boundaries, case studies, and role plays (~35%). Participants of the control group were free in choosing their activities during the control period, however, the participation neither in a SSC nor in martial arts/ combat sports was allowed.\nData are presented as means \u00b1 standard deviations. After checking for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test) and for homogeneity (Levene-Test), t-tests for independent samples were applied to check for differences between means of the change score of the assessed parameters of the two samples. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 29 women took part in the study: 18 in the intervention group (IG, 40.0 \u00b1 12.4 years) and 11 in the control group (CG, 30.5 \u00b1 9.9 years). The age difference between the groups was not significant. The results indicate that women in the IG showed significant changes in several parameters compared to those in the CG, particularly when being put into situations in which they were exposed to different forms and intensities of violence. Accordingly, higher self-confidence and self-assurance were evident in the case of severe physical violence as well as in the case of mild psychological violence and higher self-assurance was shown in the case of severe psychological violence (Figure 1). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to mild physical violence or mild and severe sexual violence. Furthermore, the assessment of the open questions with regard to the organization of the SSC and the program offered suggests that the courses were very well received by the participants.\nDiscussion\nThe study shows that a relatively short SSC leads to a higher increase of both self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women, both in situations of physical and psychological violence, compared to the control group. No significant differences between the groups were found with regard to situations of sexual violence, which is presumably due to the framework conditions of the courses (with only female participants). Therefore, future studies evaluating the impact of SSC on self-confidence and self-assurance of women exposed to sexual violence should include practice with male training partners. Additionally, in the interest of sustainability, it is important to achieve long-term changes in attitudes and behavior, which should be the goal of future research.\nThe study\u2019s limitations that should be considered include the lack of an a priori power analysis, the absence of random group allocation, the missing standardization and supervision of the activity of the control group, the use of non-validated single-item scales, possible bias due to the overestimation of effects because of the temporal proximity of the survey to the SSC, and the failure to account for confounding variables such as age, which however did not differ significantly between groups.\nConclusion\nSince violence is often perpetrated against women, particularly in Austria, and since women show less self-confidence and self-assurance than men, the promotion of high-quality SSC lasting at least 10 hours can be recommended to women in order to strengthen these resources.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to acknowledge the experts who tested and revised the questionnaire; the colleagues of the Department of Sports Science and of the Department of Psychology of the University of Innsbruck for the recruitment of the control group; the organizers of the SSC of the University of Innsbruck, the University College of Teacher Education Tyrol (PHT), the Educational Centre for Healthcare Professions for the Western Regions of Austria (AZW) as well as the Community College Tyrol (VHS Tirol) and, last but not least, the study participants.\nReferences\nBrecklin, L.

    "title": "The UWI Zoology Museum and Bioblitzing in Trinidad & Tobago: Mutual Benefits",
    "abstract": "In 2012, as Zoology Curator for the University of the West Indies Zoology Museum (UWIZM), based at the St. Augustine campus in Trinidad and Tobago, I ran the first ever bioblitz to be held in Trinidad. Since then, an event has been conducted annually. Each event is organised mainly by staff and students in The University of the West Indies (UWI) Department of Life Sciences alongside members of the Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists' Club (TTFNC). A typical event would follow this basic format: choose a new location each year, find a basecamp, set up a search area (usually a 5 km radius circle), promote the event, organise survey teams, start surveying on a Saturday, invite the public along on a Sunday to get involved and then announce the results.\n Over the years, the bioblitzes have been attended and/or assisted by more than 30 groups and organisations. These included long-established bodies such as the Asa Wright Nature Centre, the Pointe-a-Pierre Wildfowl Trust, and the Zoological Society of Trinidad and Tobago; government bodies like the Institute of Marine Affairs, the Forestry Division and the Environmental Management Authority; and newer, smaller groups such as Trinibats, Turtle Village Trust, Environmental Research Institute Charlotteville (ERIC), the Reptile Conservation Center Of Trinidad and Tobago and The El Socorro Centre for Wildlife Conservation (ECWC) (Fig. 1).\n The way these groups contributed to the events varied from being basecamp hosts to providing animal encounter experiences, and from granting access to land and giving permits to providing expert wildlife surveyors. Organisations were usually approached by me with an invitation to join a bioblitz, depending on the needs and location of the event. Sponsors for the events were found by writing to local companies, approaching those who already had community funding programmes in place.\n I left the role of UWIZM curator in 2019, but the Trinidad and Tobago Bioblitz continued and evolved. In 2019, it followed the same pattern as previous events: the organisers partnered with a local school for a basecamp and the usual participants surveyed and welcomed the public. However, in 2020 with the first COVID lockdown, they had to adapt and so changed the bioblitz into an event facilitated online by using the iNaturalist platform: T&T Bioblitz 2020 Backyard Edition. At this stage, people were restricted to their gardens or streets so observation opportunities were limited, but nevertheless there were around 6,500 observations made of almost 1,400 species over one weekend in November.\n In 2021, restrictions were still in place for large gatherings but people could travel more widely, so the same online format was repeated. Observations could be made in some of the locations of previous events, which led to 2,900 observations and just over 1,000 species. For 2022, the event stayed online but became the Inter-Island Bioblitz as it went regional with participants from Jamaica and Barbados being invited. Almost 600 people took part and recorded over 1,300 species. Finally, in 2023, the bioblitz returned to the original format and an in-person event was again possible; this continued into 2024.\n The recording of results changed over the years. For example, the use of iNaturalist went from 9 observations in 2012 to over 6,500 observations in 2020. As I was no longer resident in Trinidad, I couldn't take part directly but though iNaturalist, I could contribute by identifying observations, as could many other international identifiers. \n The majority of records made during the events were observations rather than the collection of specimens, but for some groups it was necessary to collect for further identification. Specimens collected were mostly terrestrial invertebrates, although sometimes roadkill and other specimens found dead during the events were also added to the UWIZM collections.\n After each bioblitz, a large banner was produced showing a summary of the results (Fig. 2). These were displayed at subsequent events and also as part of other displays in the UWIZM. Likewise, the trails and quizzes made for the bioblitzes were often used during the rest of the year for school groups visiting the UWIZM.\n Both in the lead up to a bioblitz and in the weeks following the event, the results are promoted in several ways: on social media (Facebook at first and later Instagram and Twitter), in national newspapers, on TV (usually getting a slot on a morning show), and through the TTFNC's Quarterly Bulletin, the final edition of the year being dedicated to that year's bioblitz. A T&T bioblitz website was made, which allowed us to collate all these outputs as well as access to the final reports for each event.\n Bioblitzes are fantastic events that bring together naturalist experts and the public. They should be a part of any natural history museum's repertoire, helping to promote and popularise the museum, as well as often providing a first exposure of citizen science to people, which can lead to a lifelong connection with nature (Fig. 3).",

    "title": "STATISTICAL METHODS FOR PREDICTING PHISHING ATTACKS",
    "abstract": "The article proposes a methodology for predicting so-called phishing attacks, which are a common form of cybercrime, the number of which is growing every year, and the level of their harmful impact on the information systems of critical infrastructure objects is also increasing. To analyze trends and predict phishing attacks, we used statistical data published in scientific works of domestic and foreign researchers, as well as published by online publications of leading consulting companies working in the field of information security and cybersecurity. Statistical methods based on the use of time series, as one of the popular approaches used to predict various technological and economic processes, were chosen as tools for researching and predicting phishing attacks. This made it possible to analyze the types and patterns of phishing attacks that attackers use to disrupt the operation of software of information and communication systems and automated systems. Based on time series analysis, a trend model was built for the number of detected phishing attacks for the period 2020\u20132023. A calculation was made of the predicted number of phishing attacks for 16 quarters of 2020\u20132023, as well as the estimated forecast of the occurrence of these attacks for four quarters of 2024. To improve the forecast, a coefficient taking into account the seasonality factor was calculated and a correlation and regression analysis of the impact of phishing attacks on the total number of attacks detected during 2020\u20132023 was performed. Calculations have been performed, indicating that the discrepancies in the predicted values are not significant; the results presented allow us to select the optimal strategy for identifying, predicting and eliminating computer attacks related to phishing. Based on the time series model and the calculations obtained, it was concluded that statistical forecasting methods make it possible to build a forecast of phishing attacks, provide in the future the opportunity to develop and formulate methods for countering these attacks, and plan measures to increase the level of security of information resources.",

    "abstract": "The year 2020 was a turning point in the way society perceives science. Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology finally showed and shared its potential, starting a new era in medicine. However, there is no doubt that commercialization of these vaccines would not have been possible without nanotechnology, which has finally answered the long-term question of how to deliver mRNA in vivo. The aim of this review is to showcase the importance of this scientific milestone for the development of additional mRNA therapeutics. Firstly, we provide a full description of the marketed vaccine formulations and disclose LNPs\u2019 pharmaceutical properties, including composition, structure, and manufacturing considerations Additionally, we review different types of lipid-based delivery technologies currently in preclinical and clinical development, namely lipoplexes and cationic nanoemulsions. Finally, we highlight the most promising clinical applications of mRNA in different fields such as vaccinology, immuno-oncology, gene therapy for rare genetic diseases and gene editing using CRISPR Cas9.",

    "title": "BERT-Based Hybrid RNN Model for Multi-class Text Classification to Study the Effect of Pre-trained Word Embeddings",
    "abstract": "Due to the Covid-19 pandemic which started in the year 2020, many nations had imposed lockdown to curb the spread of this virus. People have been sharing their experiences and perspectives on social media on the lockdown situation. This has given rise to increased number of tweets or posts on social media. Multi-class text classification, a method of classifying a text into one of the pre-defined categories, is one of the effective ways to analyze such data that is implemented in this paper. A Covid-19 dataset is used in this work consisting of fifteen pre-defined categories. This paper presents a multi-layered hybrid model, LSTM followed by GRU, to integrate the benefits of both the techniques. The advantages of word embeddings techniques like GloVe and BERT have been implemented and found that, for three epochs, the transfer learning based pre-trained BERT-hybrid model performs one percent better than GloVe-hybrid model but the state-of-the-art, fine-tuned BERT-base model outperforms the BERT-hybrid model by three percent, in terms of validation loss. It is expected that, over a larger number of epochs, the hybrid model might outperform the fine-tuned model. \u00a9 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/GOALS: With the knowledge that population health will not improve without including community voices in research, analysis of the UCI Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) Community-Campus Research Incubator (CCRI) grants awarded since 2010 provides the foundation for understanding research partnerships impact on community health. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Over the past 13 years, the UCI ICTS CCRI program has funded 63 partnered research pilot or capacity-building projects, providing up to $30K annually to academic-community partnerships. Each year since 2010, between 3 and 7 projects were funded up to $5,000 annually for capacity-building activities and up to $10,000 annually for pilot research activities. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a collaboration between the UCI ICTS and the local Healthcare Agency provided up to $20,000 to research partnership teams to study impact and interventions related to the pandemic, where 10 CCRI awards were given out. Evaluations of these research teams was completed at the end of the project, and at years 2 and 3 after the project ended. Analysis of the projects and partnerships aim to reveal the impact of these projects. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In 2023, we compiled all evaluation data collected from 2010 \u2013 2023 from the CCRI partnership grants, including traditional metrics of publications, subsequent grant applications submitted & awarded, presentations given, and return on investment for ICTS granted funds. Less traditional metrics include number of students trained, new tools or databases created, knowledge disseminated, and advances in clinical care. Since 2020, Translational Science Benefit Model metrics have been collected on community, policy, economic, and clinical domains. Since 2015, data on each CCRI partnership has been collected at the start and end of each project, with questions about attributes of each partner, trust, community engagement principles, and anticipated/actual impact of each project. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Organizing outcomes from the data collected will provide deep understanding of important components, functioning, and types and reach of partnered health research. This understanding will inform future action of the CCRI program in terms of what can be accomplished with a given amount of funding, and the constitution of successful partnerships.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The research aims to develop a comprehensive classification system for metaheuristics, categorize metaphor metaheuristics, and present the development trend and percentage representation of metaphor metaheuristics within each metaphor group. Method: A descriptive-based systematic review was conducted to collect data on studies concerning the classification of metaheuristics and the proposal of new metaheuristics. Data was sourced from Google Scholar, Science Direct, Springer, ResearchGate, and IEEE Xplore. For the first research objective, 148 studies were screened, resulting in the selection of six studies. The second and third research objectives involved screening 1145 studies, of which 654 were ultimately selected. This review considers studies published up to August 2023. The extracted data includes the characteristics of each classification and the name, abbreviation, author, year, and metaphor group for each metaheuristic reviewed. Findings: The results reveal that existing classifications do not cover the full range of metaheuristic characteristics. The data indicates a rising trend in the introduction of new metaheuristics over the years, with the peak occurring in 2020, boasting 68 new approaches, closely followed by 2022 with 57 introductions. However, between 1965 and 1992, progress was limited to only one or two new approaches annually, signifying periods of stagnation in the field. The majority of metaheuristics proposed are in the physics-chemistry metaphor group (20%), followed closely by human metaheuristics (18%). Novelty: The novelty of this study lies in its exhaustive classification of metaheuristics developed from 1965 to August 2023 based on the metaphor criterion, along with the development progression and percentage-wise representation of various metaphor groups using up-to-date data.

    "abstract": "The study aims to test the nexus of green financing with renewable electricity generation and energy efficiency. The study used data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique during the year of 2016 to 2020 in developed and developing countries. The findings show that there is a 24% possibility of worldwide rise in expenditures in renewable energy through energy efficiency projects and probably could fall around 17% much further in 2017 and 2018. This may jeopardize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris climate change agreement. Lack of access to private financing slows the development of green initiatives. Now that sustainable energy is not about science and technology, it is all about getting financing in developed and developing countries. As policy measure, the study suggested to value environmental initiatives, like other infrastructure initiatives, for greater electricity generation and energy efficiency in developed and developing countries. Such infrastructural projects need long-term financing and capital intensiveness. It is further suggested to sustain growth, development, and energy poverty reduction, and around $26 trillion would be required, in terms of green financing, in the developed and developing countries alone by the year 2030 to enhance energy efficiency. To achieve energy sustainability goals in developed and developing countries, recent research suggested some policy implication considering the post COVID-19 time. If such policy implications are implemented successfully, there are chances that green financing would make energy generation and energy efficiency effective.",

    "title": "The 30-year publication history of Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences",
    "abstract": "Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences (AJAS) is the official journal of the AsianAustralasian Association of Animal Production Societies and was founded in 1988 in Korea. The journal was created to serve the animal industry and academia in the Asian-Australasian region through the efficient publication and distribution of scientific information on animal sciences. At the beginning, there was neither a real need expressed by member countries nor a firm belief in the success of such publication activity in Asia. However, a few dedicated individuals, led by Prof. In K. Han, the first editor-in-chief, were able to turn AJAS into one of the most respected global journals in animal sciences. Over the last three decades, AJAS has achieved notable development in the quantity and quality of the articles and their publication process. AJAS initially published four issues per year; this number grew to six issues in 1995-1998, eight issues in 1999, and 12 issues from 2000 onward. Overall, the journal has published more than 5,700 articles. Total citation frequency in 1997, when AJAS was first indexed by SCIE, was lower than 100, but by 2017, it was more than 4,000. Similar improvement was seen in the two-year impact factor, which was 0.094 in 1997 and rose to 1.243 by 2017. This article aims to introduce the development of the AJAS editorial system, manuscript submission, publication activities, and citation frequency. Additionally, a special development, called the AJAS 2020 program, is introduced as a reference for other journals.",

    "abstract": "This Editorial introduces a EJSS Thematic Virtual Issue to highlight the importance of soils to celebrate World Environment Day 2022. The collection of papers selected by Dr Dan Evans is available here: https://bsssjournals. onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2389. world-environment-day Soils are one of the most significant components of terrestrial environments. They deliver an array of supporting, regulatory and provisioning roles across multiple spatial and temporal scales. It was therefore essential that soils\u2014their diversity, their multifunctionality, and their complex and dynamic relationships with other ecosystems\u2014were celebrated on annual World Environment Day, held this year on Sunday 5th June. Led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the theme of the 2022 World Environment Day was \u201cOnly One Earth\u201d. It called for collective, transformative action on a global scale to celebrate, protect and restore our planet. Confronted with ongoing and, in some cases, accelerating rates of land degradation and soil erosion, this year\u2019s theme was particularly relevant to soils. It acted as a reminder that, in human timeframes, soils are non-renewable, and that global efforts are needed to conserve them for future generations. #OnlyOneEarth This Thematic Virtual Issue of the European Journal of Soil Science serves to spotlight the importance of soil across a wide range of terrestrial environments, and to showcase the multifarious functions that soils play within these systems. The papers that have been curated for this Virtual Issue demonstrate that soil properties and processes are not only eclectic and often specialist across space and time, but that they are, to various degrees, sensitive to change, be it a short-term perturbation event (e.g. extreme weather episodes), or a longterm shift in the environment (e.g. climate change). Moreover, it will remain clear throughout reading the Virtual Issue that to bring about this \u201ctransformative action on a global scale to celebrate, protect, and restore our planet\u201d, we must first advance our understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes in soils, how these govern soil functions, and how they react to, and interact, with environmental changes imposed upon them. The significance of soils at a continental scale, and how soil functions are modulated across contrasting climatic regimes and land management practices, is exemplified at the beginning of this Virtual Issue by Zwetsloot et al. (2021). This study represents one of the first to assess and monitor soil multifunctionality across Europe. Critically, whilst multifunctionality in soil can be achieved, the authors suggest that constraints and trade-offs do exist. In the spirit of World Environment Day, the paper serves as a fitting reminder that finding solutions to protect and restore all terrestrial ecosystems simultaneously may be overly optimistic, and that optimization polices may be more effective. Noted by Zwetsloot et al. (2021) as one of the functions delivered less frequently at high capacity across Europe, protecting and restoring biodiversity is critical across many environments, globally. Soil biodiversity in particular is often sacrificed for primary productivity and nutrient cycling, as demonstrated by Vazquez et al. (2021). Here, the authors show that a careful application of pesticides and fertilisers can address this trade-off and increase soil multifunctionality, a point which is also reiterated by Shi et al. (2020) in their field-based study of the impact of long-term fertilisation on soil fungal assemblies. Land management changes can therefore play a role in governing below-ground communities, alongside long-term climatic changes. However, as Shen et al. (2020) reveals, some soil biology can acclimatise. Under a long-term warming experiment in a steppe ecosystem, the authors found that soil heterotrophic respiration acclimated to long-term warming via modifying the constitution of cell membranes. Meanwhile, the impacts of changing climatic conditions on soil macrofauna are illustrated in Singh et al. (2021) who find that seasonality plays a seminal role in modulating the effects of future climate change. The need to advance our understanding of soil chemistry to better manage terrestrial environments is also highlighted here. Part of that advancement requires improved monitoring infrastructure, as showcased by Corwin (2021) who demonstrates how proximal sensors and remote imagery can be used to assess soil salinity on dryland agricultural soils.

    "abstract": "The raindrop size distribution (RSD) characteristics over western Luzon during the Southwest Monsoon (SWM) periods from 2020\u20132022 are examined using a network of OTT PARSIVEL2 disdrometer. The three-year worth of RSD observations was collected from four disdrometer stations \u2013 namely, Science Garden, Quezon City (SG; 14.6\u00b0 N, 121.04\u00b0 E); La Mesa watershed, Quezon City (LM; 14.7\u00b0 N, 121.07\u00b0 E); Clark, Pampanga (CK; 15.18\u00b0 N, 120.5\u00b0 E); and Malolos, Bulacan (MS; 14.8\u00b0 N, 120.8\u00b0 E). Results show significant RSD differences between MS and CK stations. On average, the RSD over the MS station is dominated by a high concentration of relatively smaller raindrops, whereas large raindrops are more prevalent over the CK station. On the other hand, similar RSD properties and integral rainfall parameter (IRP) values were observed over SG and LM. In all the stations, values of mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm) and normalized intercept parameter (Log10 Nw) are higher in convective than stratiform rainfall. However, convective rainfall over the CK station has the highest values of mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm) during the SWM period. The diurnal variation of RSD also showed higher Dm over CK station, especially in the late afternoon to early evening hours. Radar reflectivity\u2013rain rate (Z-R) relations derived from the RSDs at each station showed a clear difference between stratiform and convective rainfall. The Z-R relations obtained from each station are found to be different from the conventional Marshall and Palmer relation but similar to Rosenfeld\u2019s tropical relation. The shape-slope (\u03bc-\u039b) relations derived from the gamma RSD are also shown to be distinct at each location. Despite being influenced by a similar synoptic system during the SWM period, the geographical setting of the stations and orography may be the primary reasons for the observed RSD differences.",

    "title": "The association of Ned Kelly tattoos with suicide and homicide in a forensic context\u2014a confirmatory prospective study",
    "abstract": "Ned Kelly, an iconic figure in contemporary Australian mythology, was a bushranger (outlaw) who was executed in 1880 for the murder of a serving police officer, Constable Thomas Lonigan. Kelly is often commemorated by tattoos which depict his armour and helmet or his alleged last words of \u201cSuch is life\u201d. A study was undertaken from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2020, at Forensic Science SA, Adelaide, South Australia, of all cases with such tattoos. De-identified case details included the year of death, age, sex and cause and manner of death. There were 38 cases consisting of 10 natural deaths (26.3%) and 28 unnatural (73.7%). The latter included 15 cases of suicide (39.5%), 9 accidents (23.7%) and 4 homicides (10.5%). Of the 19 suicides and homicides, there were 19 males and no females (age range 24\u201357 years; average 44 years). The number of suicides in the general South Australian forensic autopsy population in 2020 was 216/1492 (14.5%) which was significantly lower than in the study population in which 39.5% of cases were suicides (2.7 times higher; p\u2009<\u20090.001). A similar trend occurred for homicides which accounted for 17/1492 in the general forensic autopsy population (1.1%), significantly lower than in the study population which had 10.5% homicides (approximately 9.5 times higher; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Thus, in the select population referred for medicolegal autopsy, there appears no doubt that Ned Kelly tattoos are associated with suicides and homicides. While this is not a population-based study, it may provide useful information for forensic practitioners dealing with such cases.",

In this short article we\u2019d like to give you a quick roundup of the last year\u2019s publishing highlights and take a brief look ahead to 2022. Certainly, 2020 was a unique year given the challenges to the scientific community, and indeed the world as a whole, following the COVID pandemic, and 2021 saw the continuation of these challenges along with some attempt to return to a \u2018new normal\u2019 after the global vaccination roll-out and an ease of restrictions and lockdown measures. This is a perfect point to say that the completion of volume 7 of Future Science OA would certainly not have been possible without our authors and reviewers, not to mention our internal and external editorial and production teams. We are grateful for all their commitment, cooperation and hard work throughout the course of the last year. As with all our previous volumes, content published in volume 7 of Future Science OA has continued to be of a very high standard, having gone through our rigorous peer-review and revisions process. We have published a variety of article types through the past year, such as shorter opinion-based editorials and commentaries, and longer review and perspective articles, along with original research and case reports.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT IMPACT: We hosted the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Annual meeting virtually this year which resulted in positive feedback survey scores over 90% and an estimated 87% cost savings OBJECTIVES/GOALS: COVID-19 has forced many in-person meetings to become virtual, not unlike our 2020 Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute Annual Meeting. However, where anecdotal feedback has shown dissatisfaction with some on-line meetings, we were able to exceed our goals of engaging our audience, securing positive feedback and even saving money. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: More than 500 people attended the virtual 2020 Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI) Annual Meeting on September 11. The event had two plenary speakers and was completely online, utilizing both Zoom and Microsoft Teams to connect participants with the presenters. Brian Druker, MD, director of the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University, was the winner of this year\u2019s August M. Watanabe Prize in Translational Research. He gave the first plenary presentation titled, \u2018Imatinib as a Paradigm of Targeted Cancer Therapies.\u2019 Consuelo Wilkins, MD, Vice President for Health Equity at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, gave the second plenary titled, \u2018Confronting Racial Inequities through Research.' Concurrent online breakout rooms hosted the live poster session. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Despite being conducted online, the virtual Indiana CTSI annual meeting registered more participants than in years past and secured high feedback scores of 90%, all while experiencing 87% cost savings over last year\u2019s in-person meeting. By utilizing Microsoft Teams as a technology for attendees to the meeting to 'chat\u2019 and 'network\u2019 with one another during the poster presentations and virtual lunch break we were able to demonstrate the implementation of translational science through online plenary and general session presentations as well as the poster presentations. Mailing certificates to the poster winners in advance, allowed them to share their accolades with the audience by holding up their certificates once their winning posters were announced. An e-annual report also supported the success of the meeting. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: The cost savings and traditionally high feedback scores received through this year\u2019s Indiana CTSI annual meeting, mean virtual meetings are a viable way to disseminate and implement translational science. In addition the 2020 Indiana CTSI annual report received a Gold MarComm award, providing third party recognition of its impact.",

In this paper, the wind energy potential at the premises of Government Science College area [Lat. 14\u00b013\u2019\u2032 N and Long. 76\u00b027\u2032 E] in Chitradurga town (Karnataka State, India) is statistically analyzed for the year 2019 \u2013 2020. The speed of wind has been assessed at the height of 60 m from the ground level at the site. The seasonal and annual wind speed distributions (WSD) have been modelled using Weibull probability distribution functions (WPDF) i.e., shape parameter, k and scale parameters, c. With the use of them, the wind power density (WPD) has been determined. The WPD estimated from Weibull and normal methods has been found to be comparable. Further, at a height of 60 m above the ground, the capacity factors (CPs) of various marketablly useable wind turbine generators have been estimated to achieve the optimal power generation for the chosen site.",

    "abstract": "2e (twice-exceptional) students are gifted and differently-abled, so they need specific learning domains according to their needs. This research aimed to design science learning domains for a 2e (gifted and blind) student to enhance his critical thinking in his special learning needs in Ankara province in Turkey in the 2020-2021 academic year's first term. Single-subject research was employed. The 2e student was ten years old. Through the application process, the 2e student argued 3D modeled Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment. The main application's intervention was conducted to provide the research's internal validity since it was single-subject research. Through the intervention application, the 2e student argued 3D modeled Schr\u00f6dinger's twin cats thought experiment. We noted both social dialectic argumentation processes as texts, and these texts were used as data collecting tools. Descriptive analysis was utilized to gathered data. The study showed that the 2e student could construct arguments containing claim, data, warrant, and weak rebuttals in the main application, which meant his argumentation quality level was average, so his critical thinking too. In contrast, the 2e student-constructed arguments containing claim, data, weak rebuttal, and rebuttal meant his argumentation quality level enhanced his critical thinking.",

    "title": "British Journal of Biomedical Science in 2021. What have we learned?",
    "abstract": "The British Journal of Biomedical Science in its attempts to continue to make steps forward as a leading international journal, has seen a significant rise in its impact factor (IF) rating over the past year. The IF figure for 2019 was 2.712 and for 2020 it has risen to 3.829 (Figure 1). Within the category of medical laboratory technology, the journal is now ranked 6 out of 29. These data mark a significant improvement in the academic standing of the journal as compared to many of its direct rivals. The emphasis on focussing on practice, research and education in all aspects of biomedical science and its application to the study of human disease and treatment continues to remain its primary objective. As well as focusing on the scope and full range of scientific disciplines within pathology, the journal has also made significant steps to embrace the importance of molecular techniques and how these methodologies have increased our understanding of disease processes. There is also a significant attempt to keep pace with the changing scope of molecular techniques and how their constant evolution brings an ever increasing armoury of investigative tools that can be applied across a wide spectrum of pathological entities, constantly challenging traditional discipline-specific perspectives to research and development. As seen throughout the articles published in 2021, volume 78 of the British Journal of Biomedical Science (BJBS) the molecular techniques discussed are often applied as an investigative tool to determine the clinical relevance of genes in an organism\u2019s genome employing genetic screens. It also emphasizes the increasingly important role this technology has across all the traditional biomedical science disciplines. This approach helps us to understand how molecular genetics can be used as a powerful methodology for linking mutations to genetic sequences, may aid the search for treatments and or possible cures for various genetic based abnormalities. Many conditions and illnesses still cause considerable misery and suffering. Better laboratory diagnostics are therefore needed to provide more accurate information and lead to improved patient care \u2013 the aim being to provide for a higher quality of life for individuals with these conditions. Moreover some of the molecules and approaches described in the journal, such as analysis of micro-RNAs and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for a range of genes, may appear esoteric to many of us working in the laboratories, where more traditional methods hold sway. The important point here is to realize the pace of change in this area and also to recognize the importance of \u2018biomarker\u2019 studies as complementary to experimental studies on cell lines and animal based studies approach in the field, thus enabling a more synergistic approach to the study of disease mechanisms and pathological processes generally (Figure 2).",

    "abstract": "As a result of the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, universities have carried out teaching in a digital way, accelerating the inclusion and use of technologies in methodological adaptation. The research aims to ascertain the perception that students at the Faculty of Education Sciences of the University of Granada have regarding the pedagogical model adopted in the virtual learning environment during confinement through the second semester of the 2019\u20132020 academic year. The information collection method was an online questionnaire, using simple random sampling with proportional affixing 0.5, 95% confidence level and maximum permissible error of 4.7%. The results demonstrate a generalised dissatisfaction of the students, being fundamental to carry out the transition of the educational processes and training of the teaching staff. The implementation of active methodologies increases due to the virtual condition, specifically the flipped classroom methodology, but students manifest generalised dissatisfaction regarding the adequate methodological development and the involvement of professors. There is an outstanding use of e-mail and the virtual learning platform (PRADO), although they consider that they do not have the appropriate knowledge about image editors, video, computer graphics, synchronous response systems and anti-plagiarism tools. The students surveyed express that the tutoring functions, tasks and beliefs of the teaching staff in e-learning are not satisfactory.",

    "abstract": "The paper deals with the problem of physics education at high schools and problems that university students have in the first year of their study. Physics is a core subject in STEM education (STEM- science, technology, engineering, mathematics). The aim of the research was focused on parts of the physics curriculum that are difficult to teach and learn (concepts heat, temperature, density). Our research was provided in 2019-2022 at high schools (grammar schools) in the Czech Republic and in 2020-2022 at universities as part of the project Bridge2Teach solution.\nThe goal of the research was to answer two questions: 1. What are the critical places in the study program of the subject physics at high schools? 2. Can bridging courses at universities be helpful for pre-service science teacher students to overcome gaps in knowledge during the first term of the studies? The findings of this study are discussed in this manuscript. Examples of ways to prepare study materials for high school students are given.",

    "abstract": "With China announcing its dual carbon goals in 2020 and its promotion of sustainability policies in the 14th Five-Year Plan, sustainable development has become an increasingly important issue. In the context of sustainable development, China\u2019s society has some defects in science and technology, policy governance, environmental governance and economic development, and the technology is not perfect. There are scientific and technological challenges such as renewable energy development and utilization; governance challenges such as international cooperation over climate issues and domestic regulations. In terms of the environment, China\u2019s air, water resources, soil and physical pollution are still not optimistic. The economic problems in the context of sustainable development have different defects. Corresponding improvement measures to address such challenges have been suggested. For science and technology, developing and utilizing new energy through increasing the number of research and development (R&D) personnel and patents is important. Furthermore, completing the innovation of clean technology through updating technology and policy support is also a big issue. For political governance challenges, some analysts pointed that a shared knowledge platform helps with international cooperation, and non-state actors such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and businesses could contribute to domestic regulations. For environmental governance, air pollution is controlled through the development of carbon\u00a0capture,\u00a0utilization\u00a0and\u00a0storage (CCUS) technology, the control of soil pollution is achieved through ex-situ remediation and in-situ repair technology, the control of water pollution is achieved by developing microorganisms and other methods. For economic development, innovation, policy support, and financial framework are vital.",

    "abstract": "Every year salt was carried out by PT Garam twice whereas the previous process used the method of terrestrial and manual calculations with sacks. Therefore, a map of salt production is needed using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor navigation system to increase the data's accuracy level. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle applications for the purpose of obtaining geometric documentation results and for capturing textures that characterize object structures. (Adamopoulos, 2020). LiDAR can classify based on the number of image acquisitions processed in the software, utilizing photogrammetric, and structural science principles from Motion technology. (Fern\u00e1ndez, Hernandez et.al 2015) LiDAR Acquisition process that enables the creation of point clouds, three-dimensional models, and Digital Surface Models with high accuracy. (Barba, et al. 2019). A three-dimensional model makes it easy for users to choose a virtual position on the map, has good accuracy in interpreting the map, and displays a more real shape. LiDAR has a disadvantage in the form of coordinate data positions that have local references. (Cahyadi., et al. 2019). Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology has the advantage of efficiency in the cost and time of data collection. These researchers use multi-sensor technology GNSS, LiDAR, and Drones to map the stockpile of salt on open land and in warehouses. makes it easy to calculate the area of salt land and calculate the volume of salt production. This was done for PT GARAM to meet the community's needs and monitor the amount of salt production. This data can be used as a reference for digital asset inventory and the system can be applied to optimize the salt industry. The drones used in this study are the DJI Matrice 300 and the Low-Cost Drone Tarot Iron Man 650. Both types of drones are used to measure land and salt volume. The end product of the research is in the form of data generated in the form of a point cloud to calculate the salt stockpile volume and the elevation level of the salt land area",

    "abstract": "The present investigation\u00a0was undertaken during the year July/2020-June/21 and July/2021- June/22 at experimental field of Horticulture Instructional Farm, Department of Fruit Science College of Agriculture, IGKV, Raipur (C.G.), India. The experiment was conducted on twenty years old trees of sapota, Cricket Ball with foliar spray of different concentrations of plant growth regulators applied at 50 per cent flowering and pea stage of fruit growth. The experiment was laid out in Randomized Block Design with twenty five treatments, and three replication for each treatment. Thus, a total of 75 data collection made available at each time. Physical parameters of fruit viz., fruit weight (126.36 g \u00b131.07g), fruit volume (121.59 ml \u00b129.07 ml), fruit diameter (6.69 cm \u00b11.33 cm), fruit length (6.92 cm \u00b12.01 cm) and pulp weight (112.61 g \u00b1 2.01 g) of sapota fruits were increased with the treatment GA3 @ 150 ppm, while, the peel weight (8.79 g \u00b1 1.72 g) was reduced under the same treatment. The specific gravity (1.045 g \u00b1 0.015 gml-1) was recorded maximum under the treatment ethrel @ 1000 ppm. However, a reduction in number of seeds per fruit\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4.50 \u00b1 2.08) and seed weight (4.38 g \u00b1 0.78 g) was observed by the foliar feeding of NAA @ 100 ppm treatment. The consumer demand, which is usually based on physical characteristics of sapota fruit, can be improved by the application of plant growth regulators. On the basis of the experience gained and results obtained after completion of present investigation, the most appropriate concentration and their time of application should be standardized for different cultivars of sapota.",

    "abstract": "Some Mathematics undergraduate students who reckoned high grades in SSCE Mathematics, high scores in UTME and Post-UTME Mathematics end up spending extra years in the university, some graduating with low class of degrees and some others dropping out of school. Hence, the need for this study which was specifically aimed at determining students\u2019 UTME scores in Mathematics, and Post-UTME scores in Mathematics as correlates of the first year mean achievement scores of the students in undergraduate Mathematics. The design of the study was correlational survey research design. The study was guided by three research questions, and three hypotheses. The study was carried out in Ebonyi State. The study used a sample of 120 students out of the total population of 146 students drawn from the 2018/2019, 2019/2020, and 2020/2021 academic sessions in both the Pure and Applied Mathematics and Mathematics Education courses using both purposive sampling and proportionate random sampling techniques. The data were collected using a researchers-made instrument which was face validated by three experts, one in Measurement and Evaluation; and two experts in Mathematics Education all in Department of Science Education. The data were analyzed using Pearson Product Moment correlation, Regression Analysis and Analysis of Variance. The research questions were answered using the Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficients, while all the hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance, using exact probability approach. The findings of the study showed that students\u2019 UTME and Post-UTME scores in Mathematics significantly positively correlated with the first year mean achievement scores of the students in undergraduate Mathematics. Hence, the researchers concluded that both UTME and Post-UTME scores in Mathematics are reliable predictors of the students\u2019 academic achievement in undergraduate Mathematics.",

    "abstract": "This study examined Bachelor of Education students\u2019 perceptions on the impact of Micro-teaching (MT) on their Teaching Practice (TP) performance in University of Kabianga, Kenya. Descriptive Survey research design was adopted in the study to collect data from a population comprising of 460 fourth year students in the 2020/2021 academic year in the School of Education, Arts and Social Sciences. A structured 16-item electronic questionnaire was designed by the researcher using google forms referred to as Impact of Micro-teaching on Teaching Practice Performance Questionnaire (IMTTPPQ) was used in data collection. Cronbach Alpha formula was used to obtain the co-efficient index of reliability of data collection instrument which yielded 0.82. Four research questions were raised to guide the study and two corresponding null hypotheses were formulated and tested at 0.05 level of significance. The electronic Questionnaire was shared via social media platforms and a total of 106 voluntary responses were received from the target population. The four research questions were analyzed using frequency distribution table, mean and standard deviation while t-test was used to compare means between the two groups and guide in making decisions on hypotheses testing. The two hypotheses of the study were accepted. The findings of the study revealed that Micro-teaching prepared the trainee teachers adequately for Teaching Practice and also motivated them in their teaching profession. Based on these findings, it was recommended that adequate attention should be given to the way Micro-teaching should be carried out in Schools of Education. More time should be allocated for Micro-teaching to enable trainee teachers to acquire required competencies to an acceptable level. During Micro-teaching any deficiencies observed during teaching should be corrected and students encouraged to re-plan and re-teach with an aim of acquiring required competencies before they are exposed to Teaching Practice.",

    "abstract": "China has witnessed a substantial number of land-use type shifts and broken land-use distribution patterns as a result of massive irrational exploitation, which has led to problems like a significant loss of environmental habitability and declining ecosystem functioning. Investigating the origins and mechanisms of land-use change is essential. The results show that earlier land-use models, which also lacked simulation studies and projections of land-use changes in Shaanxi Province over a 20-year timeframe, find it difficult to integrate quantitative and spatial pattern forecasts. This paper uses the patch-generating land usage simulation (PLUS) model to assess Shaanxi Province's land use patterns between 2000 and 2020 and predict land usage for the year 2025.Farmland, woodlands, and grassland are the three main land types that make up most of the Shaanxi Province's total area. Forests make up most of the land that will be transferred between 2000 and 2020, while agriculture makes up most of the land that will be transferred. Most of the elements influencing the spread of all land use types were rainfall and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The central and southern regions of Shaanxi province will primarily experience changes in land use by 2025.This research offering a resource for Shaanxi Province's science of land use structure and efficient land resource allocation.",

    "abstract": "This review focuses on different techniques used in the in-silico drug design, such as molecular modeling, molecular docking, pharmacophore mapping, QSAR, and more, and also highlights and looks at how these techniques are being used to create new potential anticancer drugs for their effective cancer treatments. Most of the article studies focus on In-silico approaches only but rarely on the In-silico approach used to develop anticancer drugs with effective targets. Cancer, which is caused by pathophysiological changes in the normal process of cell division, has become a serious disorder that kills a lot of people every year all over the world. Recently, more than 19.3 million (19,300,000) new instances of cancer were identified and reported; based on the available data, this will result in almost 10 million fatalities in 2020. The necessity and desire for powerful medications to treat various malignancies have been sparked by the persistently rising occurrences of cancer worldwide, resulting in millions of deaths each year. Developing new anticancer drugs is a high priority for researchers and medical professionals, and designing these anticancer drugs is challenging, expensive, and time-consuming. In-silico drug design, also known as computer-aided drug discovery/design (CADD) approaches, have been created to get around these restrictions and manage massive amounts of emerging data. It is possible to use computational tools to aid in the design of experiments and, more crucially, to clarify the links between structure and activity that underlie drug discovery and lead optimization techniques. To design effective new drugs, one should understand the molecular processes that cause cancer on the molecular level. In silico drug design is a powerful tool for understanding these molecular processes and developing new and effective anticancer drugs.

    "title": "Production and Productivity of Oat (Avena sativa L.) Cultivars as Fodder Crop on Hilly Terraces of Nagaland under Rainfed Condition",
    "abstract": "Background: Agricultural background of rural India, maintaining cattle is very important, but due to the lack of pasture land and fodder production, it is tough to maintain the cattle with the farmers. However, producing fodder crops throughout the year makes it possible to maintain cattle. During the rainy season, different grasses are available, but during the rabi season dry period, fodder becomes scares, so growing fodder oats will compensate during the lean period. Methods: A field experiment was conducted during the rabi season of 2019 and 2020 at the experimental research farm, School of Agricultural Sciences, Nagaland University, Medziphema. The experiment consisted of six varieties of oat, namely, V1-OS-346, V2-OS-403, V3-WJ-8, V4-OS-6, V5-OS-7 and V6-OS-377, which were laid out in randomized block design (RBD) with four replications to find out the best suitable variety under rainfed condition of Nagaland. Result: The study revealed that all the oat varieties grew well under Nagaland conditions. The variety OS-403 recorded the highest plant height (72.69 cm) and was at par with variety WJ-8 (72.43 cm). Among the varieties, green fodder yield and dry matter yield were significant. The variety OS-403 recorded the highest green fodder yield (148 q/ha), followed by WJ-8 (143.11 q/ha). Similar is the trend for dry matter yield. The variety OS-403 recorded the highest dry matter yield (27.97q/ha), at par with variety WJ-8 (27.22 q/ha). Crude protein content (%) and crude protein yield (q/ha) were non-significant among the different oat varieties.\n",

    "title": "Influence of Nutrient Regulation on Ricebean (Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi and Ohashi) Growth and Dry Matter",
    "abstract": "Aims: Within the realm of sustainable agriculture and its attendant issues, there exists a compelling need for a viable approach to cropping systems that integrates pragmatic and economically sound crop management tactics. This is imperative to uphold land productivity and secure a lasting provision of crops for human consumption. Acknowledging the pivotal contribution of organic manure when combined with chemical fertilizers in crop cultivation and the safeguarding of soil well-being, a research inquiry was formulated for a noteworthy cropping sequence. \nStudy Design: Randomized block design. \nPlace and Duration: School of Agricultural Sciences, Nagaland University, Medziphema. Duration: 2019-2021. \nMethodology: The study took place from 2019 to 2021 at the School of Agricultural Sciences (SAS), Medziphema Campus in Nagaland. The primary aim was to assess the lasting impact of both manure and fertilizers on yield and soil condition in a ricebean system over this two-year duration. In the second week of April in both 2019 and 2020, Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata), a green manure crop, was sown using seeds. After a 30-day decomposition period, this green manure was incorporated into the soil. Soil samples were collected from the upper 0-15 cm layer of each experimental plot and analyzed. The experimental field was laid out in randomized block design with three level of organic manures i.e., poultry manure (PM), pig manure (PGM) and farm yard manure (FYM) along with doses of inorganic fertilizers : 100% RDF, 75% RDF, 50% RDF. The treatment combinations included T1 : GM (Sesbania) + PM (0.7 t ha-1) + 100 % RDF; T2:\u00a0 GM (Sesbania) +PM (0.7 t\u00a0\u00a0 ha-1) + 75 % RDF; T3: GM (Sesbania) + PM (0.7 t\u00a0 ha-1) + 50 % RDF ; T4:\u00a0 GM (Sesbania) + PGM (0.7 t ha-1) + 100 % RDF; T5:\u00a0 GM (Sesbania) +PGM (0.7 t ha-1) + 75% RDF; T6: GM (Sesbania) + PGM (0.7 t ha-1) + 50 % RDF; T7:\u00a0 GM (Sesbania) +FYM (4 t ha-1) + 100 % RDF; T8: GM (Sesbania) + FYM (4 t ha-1) + 75 % RDF; T9:\u00a0 GM (Sesbania) +FYM (4 t ha-1) + 50 % RDF. \nResults: In treatment T1, which involved the application of a blend of green manure and poultry manure at a rate of 0.7 tons per hectare, coupled with a full dose of RDF, exhibited outstanding outcomes in ricebean cultivation. This resulted in elevated seed yields, improved seed quality, sustained soil health, and maximized economic gains for farmers in the foothill conditions of Nagaland. \nConclusion: The substantial enhancement in ricebean growth parameters can be credited to the rich nutrient content and beneficial micronutrients present in poultry manure. combining Recommended Dose of Fertilizers (RDF) with poultry manure, known for its ability to boost nodule formation in legumes, improved soil fertility, fostered beneficial microbial activity, and promoted legume health, ultimately leading to higher yields. In contrast, farmyard manure (FYM) outperformed pig manure due to its balanced nutrients, microbial activity, organic matter, and positive impact on soil quality, creating an optimal environment for plant growth. Poultry manure's capacity to stimulate nodule formation, enhance soil fertility, and support legume health resulted in increased nitrogen fixation and improved yields in leguminous crops, fostering early root development and robust growth in ricebean crops.",

    "title": "Lessons Learned from Scaling Sisters Rise Up",
    "abstract": "Sisters Rise Up is a near-peer mentoring program that attempts to help women of color (Black, Latina, and/or Native American) succeed in their Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science (CS) courses and on the exams. Women of color are underrepresented in computing careers and have lower pass rates on the AP CS exams than their White and Asian peers. AP Computer Science A (CSA) is equivalent to a college-level first course for computer science majors while AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) is equivalent to an introductory course for non-majors. Secondary students (ages 14-19) take AP courses for college credit and/or placement. Sisters Rise Up offers remote help sessions run by near-peer undergraduate students and uses free and interactive ebooks. Sisters Rise Up originated at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2014. This paper reports on an effort to scale Sisters Rise Up to six institutions during the 2019-2020 academic year as well as an effort to support women of color through a single institution during 2020-2021. In 2019-2020 there were problems with getting Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, recruiting, training, and program fidelity. However, at least two of the six institutions had a high pass rate on the AP CS exams in 2019-2020. In 2019-2020 there were 17 women of color enrolled from five states, while in 2020-2021 Sisters Rise Up had 19 women of color enrolled from 12 states. This paper reviews the history, outlines the program details and rationale, presents the outcomes, and outlines future directions.",

    "title": "Exploring Student Experiences in Early Computing Courses during Emergency Remote Teaching",
    "abstract": "Spring 2020 brought enormous change to student learning, as universities scrambled to put into place support structures to aid students' learning in a remote context. Computer science education was both well-positioned for this change and faced unique challenges, e.g. that students often need significant (in-person) support with programming. In this study we examine how aspects of students' remote learning experience in spring 2020 compared to the same aspects in previous in-person, pre-COVID offerings of 6 lower- to mid-division computer science courses at UC San Diego (UCSD), a large US research university. We were in a unique position to make this comparison because we had been collecting data on several aspects of students' course experiences throughout the 2019-2020 academic year. We found, surprisingly, that most elements of students' experiences that we examined were unchanged, or even improved, in spring 2020. Students in spring reported similar or lower stress levels and found their courses similarly or less challenging relative to previous quarters. However, some aspects did degrade. Students had less connection with their peers (particularly in introductory classes), more interference from family obligations, and higher drop/fail rates in some classes. Surprisingly, these results hold across all assessed demographics. Our results indicate that the actions UCSD and its CS instructors took to mitigate the stresses of remote learning in spring 2020 were largely successful and provide implications for improving education beyond the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Ocean observatories collect large volumes of video data, with some data archives now spanning well over a few decades, and bringing the challenges of analytical capacity beyond conventional processing tools. The analysis of such vast and complex datasets can only be achieved with appropriate machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. The implementation of AI monitoring programs for animal tracking and classification becomes necessary in the particular case of deep-sea cabled observatories, as those operated by Ocean Networks Canada (ONC), where Petabytes of data are now collected each and every year since their installation. Here, we present a machine-learning and computer vision automated pipeline to detect and count sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), a key commercially exploited species in the N-NE Pacific. We used 651 hours of video footage obtained from three long-term monitoring sites in the NEPTUNE cabled observatory, in Barkley Canyon, on the nearby slope, and at depths ranging from 420 to 985 m. Our proposed AI sablefish detection and classification pipeline was tested and validated for an initial 4.5 month period (Sep 18 2019-Jan 2 2020), and was a first step towards validation for future processing of the now decade-long video archives from Barkley Canyon. For the validation period, we trained a YOLO neural network on 2917 manually annotated frames containing sablefish images to obtain an automatic detector with a 92% Average Precision (AP) on 730 test images, and a 5-fold cross-validation AP of 93% (\u00b1 3.7%). We then ran the detector on all video material (i.e., 651 hours from a 4.5 month period), to automatically detect and annotate sablefish. We finally applied a tracking algorithm on detection results, to approximate counts of individual fishes moving on scene and obtain a time series of proxy sablefish abundance. Those proxy abundance estimates are among the first to be made using such a large volume of video data from deep-sea settings. We discuss our AI results for application on a decade-long video monitoring program, and particularly with potential for complementing fisheries management practices of a commercially important species.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The variety, scope, and impact of open access (OA) diamond journals across disciplines and regions from July 22 to September 11, 2020 were charted to characterize the current OA diamond landscape.Methods: The total number of diamond journals was estimated, including those outside the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). The distribution across regions, disciplines, and publisher types was described. The scope of journals in terms of authorship and readership was investigated. Information was collected on linguistic diversity, journal dynamics and life cycle, and their visibility in scholarly databases.Results: The number of OA diamond journals is estimated to be 29,000. OA diamond journals are estimated to publish 356,000 articles per year. The OA diamond sector is diverse in terms of regions (45% in Europe, 25% in Latin America, 16% in Asia, and 5% in the United States/Canada) and disciplines (60% humanities and social sciences, 22% sciences, and 17% medicine). More than 70% of OA diamond journals are published by university-owned publishers, including university presses. The majority of OA diamond journals are small, publishing fewer than 25 articles a year. English (1,210), Spanish (492), and French (342) are the most common languages of the main texts.

    "title": "Influence of Seeding Rates and Nutrition Conditions on the Yield of Soft Wheat on Ridge Sowings under Irrigated Conditions",
    "abstract": "The research was carried out in a 2-factor (3x3) field experiment on ridge crops of the Tartar regional experimental station of the Azerbaijan Research Institute of Agriculture under the irrigation conditions of the Karabakh plain and the results obtained are presented in the article. The object of the study was the soft wheat variety Onur. Three variants of each factor were studied against the background of seeding rates and nutritional conditions. So, the seeding rate is 2 million/pcs. (90-100 kg/ha), 3 million/piece. (130-140 kg/ha) and 4 million/piece. (170-180 kg/ha), and against the background of nutritional conditions, the studies were carried out by experiment in 3 replications in the variant without fertilizers, N90P60 and N120P90. The crop was collected directly by a combine at the full ripening phase for each replicate, and after harvesting, the yield was determined by weighing the crop. Based on the results obtained, an analysis of variance was carried out using the Spss 26 computer program. Thus, according to the average 3-year research result for the 2020-2023 growing season, it was established that sowing rates and nutritional conditions are important in increasing the grain yield of soft wheat. Thus, as the seeding rate increased, the yield increased, but after reaching the optimal rate, increasing the rate reduced the yield. Against the background of nutritional conditions, an increase in productivity was observed with an increase in the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus by 30 kg due to the active substance. As a result of the experiment, optimal seeding rates and nutritional conditions were established, the fertilizer rate N120P90was introduced at a seeding rate of 3 million/pcs (130-140 kg/ha), the yield of the soft wheat variety Onur was 68.2 c/ha.",

    "title": "PSII-7 Is Scrotal Ultrasound a Useful Tool in Ram Breeding Soundness examination?",
    "abstract": "\n Varicocele, a condition of abnormally dilated veins within the pampiniform plexus, is associated with reduced male fertility in several species but its frequency and impact in rams is not well documented. Semen was collected and pampiniform plexus ultrasound performed in early December during breeding soundness examinations (BSE) of mature Composite-IV rams over a three-year study. A portion of rams were evaluated in multiple years and data from a total of 129 collections on 90 rams were available for analyses. Semen parameters were estimated by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Imaging software was used to quantify the cross-sectional area of five vessels per testis and average areas of the left testis (AAL), right testis (AAR), and both testes (AAT) were calculated. The correlation between AAL and AAR measured on the same ram within a year was moderate and positive (0.51; P < 0.001). However, correlations between AAL, AAR, and AAT measured on the same ram in consecutive years were not different from zero. Average vessel area was analyzed with fixed effects of testis side (AAL or AAR), year (2020, 2021, or 2022), ram age (2, 3, or \u2265 4 yr-old) and a random effect of ram. Across years, AAL was 23 to 25% greater than AAR and 16 to 18% greater in \u2265 4-yr-old than younger rams (P < 0.01). Unilateral varicocele (UV) was diagnosed when AAL/AAR or AAR/AAL ratio exceeded 1.5 in a ram and, for rams sampled in multiple years, those diagnosed in one year were considered affected for all subsequent years. Within year, prevalence of UV ranged from 16 to 36%. Scrotal circumference (SC) and CASA parameters were analyzed with fixed effects of year, ram age, and UV status and a random effect of ram. Within 2- and 3-yr-olds, sperm from UV rams had lower motility than unaffected rams (42.1 \u00b1 6.7% vs 62.2 \u00b1 4.1% and 47.8 \u00b1 7.4% vs 70.1 \u00b1 4.7%, respectively; P \u2264 0.02) but no differences were observed within 4-yr-old rams. Across ages, sperm from UV rams had a lower percentage of normal than unaffected rams (91.5 \u00b1 1.1% vs 94.3 \u00b1 0.74%; P = 0.03). Sperm concentration, progressive motility, and SC were unaffected by UV status. Future studies will evaluate the effect UV status on siring capacity. Ultrasound methodologies previously refined to diagnose varicocele in boars helped identify sub-fertile rams that would not have been classified by routine BSE procedures. However, these methodologies would benefit from concurrent machine learning and software development to ensure imaging consistency across technicians and streamline procedures for real-time decision making.

    "title": "The Trajectory of Two Decades of Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management and Flexibility Research: A Bibliometric Analysis",
    "abstract": "In the year 2020, the Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management (GJFSM) has celebrated its two decades of publication. This study is an attempt to commemorate the two decades of publication by presenting the overview of the GJFSM along with the trajectory of flexibility research in various journals. By using multiple bibliometric tools and indicators, the study finds that the GJFSM has grown over the years in terms of total publications and citations. The contributors are from across the globe, i.e., South America, North America, Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific. The Journal publishes several flexibility areas, including information systems flexibility, financial flexibility, supply chain flexibility, technology management flexibility, marketing flexibility, organizational flexibility, strategic flexibility, and manufacturing flexibility. The GJFSM is cited by authors from various countries across the globe. It has been cited across different Scopus categorizations, including \u201cStrategy and Management,\u201d \u201cBusiness and International Management,\u201d \u201cGeneral Business, Management and Accounting,\u201d \u201cIndustrial and Manufacturing Engineering,\u201d and \u201cManagement Science and Operations Research.\u201d Keyword co-occurrences analysis helps to analyze the various groups of keywords cited together in the GJFSM. Co-citation analysis of references helps to identify crucial clusters of GJFSM, i.e., strategic flexibility, manufacturing flexibility, the conceptual framework of flexibility, supply chain flexibility, modeling flexibility, and application of TISM. Overall, GJFSM has seen an increase in both publications and citations, reflecting its increasing presence among the journals publishing flexibility research. The diversity of flexibility research and its contributions to research under-one-roof make this Journal unique. The paper concludes with the gap areas of flexibility research and the way forward.",

Sixteen treatments viz. four levels of NAA (0, 20, 30 and 40 ppm) and 2,4,5-T (0, 10, 20 and 30ppm) were studies in a Factorial Completely Randomized Design with three replications. Spraying was done on eleventh November, 2020 in first year and fifteenth November, 2021 in second year at fruit setting stage (Pea Stage) with fine nozzle sprayer in each treatment to give uniform spray on all over the treatment of ber plant. Application of (NAA@40 ppm and 2,4,5-T@30 ppm) significantly maximized initial fruit set (162.00 and 163.66), maximum fruit retention (20.39 and 20.43 percent) and maximum initial fruit set percentage (79.60 and 79.56 per cent). The length and width of fruit was significantly (5.35 and 4.99 cm) and (4.24 and 4.27 cm) respectively increased by application same concentration mention above. The maximum (36.62 and 36.82 g) fruit weight and physical properties of fruits like volume (36.57 and 36.42 cc) recorded under treatment (NAA@40ppm and 2,4,5-T@30ppm).

    "abstract": "Social media has been well-established in health-related purposes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary reviews have summarized social media uses for a distinctive health purpose such as health interventions, health campaigns, medical education, and disease outbreak surveillance. The most recent thorough review of social media uses for health purposes, however, was conducted in 2013. A systematic review that covers various health purposes is needed to reveal the new usages and research gaps that emerge in recent years. This study aimed to provide a systematic review of social media uses for health purposes that have been identified in previous studies. The researchers searched for peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2010 and 2020 in.10 databases covering medicine, public health, and social science. After classifying the articles in terms of publication year, journal area, country, method, social media platform, and social media use for health purposes, the researchers provided a review of social media use for health purposes identified in these articles. This study summarized 7 social media uses for various health purposes by health organizations, health researchers and practitioners, and the public. Social media can be used for various health purposes. Several new usages have emerged since 2013 including advancing health research and practice, social mobilization, and facilitating offline health-related services and events. Research gaps exist regarding advancing strategic use of social media based on audience segmentation, understanding the impact of health identity development, and addressing privacy concerns and evaluating the impact of social media in health interventions. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).",

    "abstract": "The Department of Tadris IPA IAIN Ponorogo in the 2020/2021 school year redesigned the curriculum to become the KKNI. The KKNI is applied to students starting in semester 1 of the 2020/2021 academic year. Where the types of courses and learning carried out are of course different from the previous curriculum. Implementation of learning with KKNI is certainly not as easy as expected. One of the obstacles to implementing the KKNI is the unavailability of the KKNI based lecturer and student handbooks that can be used during the learning process. Based on interviews with several science lecturers who were teaching in semester 1, the teaching materials used were still the teaching materials used in the previous curriculum. For example, when teaching the Energy in Living Systems course, the handbook used is the basic physics textbook used to teach students in the previous semester. This is what causes the buildup of material and is not optimal in linking physics material with other fields and teaching it more contextually. This is what underlies researchers to develop a textbook on energy in living systems based on the seven components of effective learning.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the impact of the roles of internal and external accountants on taxpayer compliance in moderation of good corporate governance. This study uses explanatory research with a quantitative approach. The population for this study was corporate taxpayers registered with the KPP Masuk Bursa Company (PMB) for the 2018\u20132020 fiscal year. Purposive sampling was used in this study, and the sample size was 78 companies\u2019 data. Moderated Regression Analysis (MRA) was used to analyze the data. Techniques for collecting data include literature research and documentation. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) analyzed the data. The findings of this study indicate that the role of internal accountants, as proxied by the timeliness of financial report submission, has a significant positive effect on corporate taxpayer compliance. In addition, the role of external auditors, as represented by audit opinion, has a significant and positive impact on taxpayer compliance. Furthermore, GCG can moderate or strengthen the impact of internal and external accountants on taxpayer compliance. The position of internal accountants and the role of external accountants can both improve corporate taxpayer compliance.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0",

    "abstract": "National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) mentioned that students will join the teaching profession not by chance but by choice. They recommended a four-year integrated teacher education program (ITEP). Also, it has been pointed out that the teacher education institute (TEI) will run independently; either they must join the college cluster model or offer other UG/PG courses, including a teacher education program. The Gazette of India notification (26th October 2021) was released by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) to implement the NEP:2020 recommendations in the TEI. On that, NCTE mentioned ITEP (No. 15). UG teacher education courses, as per the ITEP directives, will be i.BA BEd ii.BSc BEd iii.BCom BEd. In Physical Education, there are three courses i. Diploma in Physical Education (No. 6) ii. Bachelor of Physical Education (No 7) iii. Master of Physical Education (No 8). In this article, the present author, an experienced teacher in the field of Physical Education, Exercise, and Sport Science, proposed four years integrated Bachelor of Physical Education program with a Physical Education major and Sport Science minor and also invite debate, discussion, modification and further upgradations from the all-cross sections of our society.",

    "title": "Implementation of Innovative Educational Technologies in Teaching of Anatomy and Basic Medical Sciences During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Developing Country: The COVID-19 Silver Lining?",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article is a descriptive and reflective piece on the strategic adaptations that facilitated and enabled the teaching of anatomy and related basic medical sciences to medical students in an African medical school that never shut down during the COVID-19 induced lockdown of the year 2020. The article considers the roles of educational technology, innovations, media and how these were used to achieve learning objectives with optimal outcomes during the lockdown. Specific technologies and innovations including the Anatomage Table, Complete 3D Anatomy software, and the use of High-Fidelity Mannequin were deployed to facilitate effective teaching of anatomy and related basic medical sciences. This was aided by the robust use of a learning management system \u2013 Canvas, as well as internet facility for connection, videoconferencing, online sessions and online-based assessment in a strategically organised manner. This system was dynamic enough to respond to changes in COVID-19 related government policies including the lockdown and social distancing-related adjustments in the physical settings. The outcome was that the teaching of medical students did not stop, and optimal results were achieved. The article considers the roles of educational technology and innovations as well as the media and how these were used to achieve learning objectives with optimal outcomes during the lockdown. It is believed that this experiential piece would inspire and inform other medical schools on the benefit of building robustly dynamic medical school systems as well as the use of innovations in times of challenges. The article also considers both the limitations and benefits of technology in teaching anatomy. Very importantly, specific tools, innovations, and technologies were considered as used, and the information provided might be a guide for other potential users. Ultimately, the lesson learned would be of use to us and we believe we could also benefit many others.",

    "abstract": "High-performance computing (HPC) is recognized as one of the pillars for further progress in science, industry, medicine, and education. Current HPC systems are being developed to overcome emerging architectural challenges in order to reach Exascale level of performance, projected for the year 2020. The much larger embedded and mobile market allows for rapid development of intellectual property (IP) blocks and provides more flexibility in designing an application-specific system-on-chip (SoC), in turn providing the possibility in balancing performance, energy-efficiency, and cost. In the Mont-Blanc project, we advocate for HPC systems being built from such commodity IP blocks, currently used in embedded and mobile SoCs. As a first demonstrator of such an approach, we present the Mont-Blanc prototype; the first HPC system built with commodity SoCs, memories, and network interface cards (NICs) from the embedded and mobile domain, and off-the-shelf HPC networking, storage, cooling, and integration solutions. We present the system's architecture and evaluate both performance and energy efficiency. Further, we compare the system's abilities against a production level supercomputer. At the end, we discuss parallel scalability and estimate the maximum scalability point of this approach across a set of applications.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe effect of adolescent overweight on future adult coronary heart disease (CHD) is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe estimated the prevalence of obese 35-year-olds in 2020 on the basis of adolescent overweight in 2000 and historical trends regarding overweight adolescents who become obese adults. We then used the CHD Policy Model, a state-transition computer simulation of U.S. residents who are 35 years of age or older, to project the annual excess incidence and prevalence of CHD, the total number of excess CHD events, and excess deaths from both CHD and other causes attributable to obesity from 2020 to 2035. We also modeled the effect of treating obesity-related increases in blood pressure and dyslipidemia.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAdolescent overweight is projected to increase the prevalence of obese 35-year-olds in 2020 to a range of 30 to 37% in men and 34 to 44% in women. As a consequence of this increased obesity, an increase in the incidence of CHD and in the total number of CHD events and deaths is projected to occur in young adulthood. The increase is projected to continue in both absolute and relative terms as the population reaches middle age. By 2035, it is estimated that the prevalence of CHD will increase by a range of 5 to 16%, with more than 100,000 excess cases of CHD attributable to the increased obesity. Aggressive treatment with currently available therapies to reverse modifiable obesity-related risk factors would reduce, but not eliminate, the projected increase in the number of CHD events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough projections 25 or more years into the future are subject to innumerable uncertainties, extrapolation from current data suggests that adolescent overweight will increase rates of CHD among future young and middle-aged adults, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "The Padma Multipurpose Bridge (PMB) is one of the biggest megaprojects of Bangladesh connecting one third of the country with the capital city, Dhaka. The infrastructure is expected to produce considerable uplift on the nation\u2019s transport system, the national and regional economy, employment, household income, and ultimately, poverty reduction. From construction and river management points of view, it is\u00a0 the most difficult and\u00a0 engineering innovation-intenstive project in the world. Hence the Padma Multipurpose Bridge (PMB) required analytical, computational and experimental studies. In this work, a 3D Finite Element (FE) model of the actual PMB containing a single (6x150m) 900m modules has been developed in MIDAS Civil, a commercial computer program for bridges. P-y soil spring model following API guideline has been developed to conform flexible support system of the bridge pier. Following BNBC 2020, the bridge's performance has been evaluated for the 475-year, 975 years, and 2475-year return periods for Service Level, Design Basis and the Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE), respectively. The forced based design shows that the bridge pier reached only 28% and 36% of its axial and shear capacity respectively for an earthquake return period of 2475 years. On the other hand, the pier has reached a maximum of 41% of its total shear capacity for the same seismic level.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an experience report from an NSF-funded researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) project. Based on a collaboration among two public research universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA, the goal of the project is to establish an institutionalized middle school computer science curriculum in the districts. The CS curriculum incorporates digital literacy skills as an integral aspect of learning computer science, and is based on students developing mobile apps that provide social and community good. Here, we share our professional learning process during the project's first year, which had been developed iteratively and dynamically adjusted to a remote format in response to exigencies of Spring 2020. The paper includes analysis of three data sets from teacher-participants: (1) their questions about the nature of the project, which we categorized into three levels: project, district and teacher levels. These questions bridge the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners; (2) analysis of semi-structured interview conversations with more than half of the teacher-participants; and (3) teacher survey responses. Our findings include two recommendations: that RPP projects elicit teacher questions to illuminate the three levels identified, and use strategies that engage teachers in designing a professional learning process for teaching computer science.",

    "abstract": "Equity in school mathematics education ideally means providing students with the opportunity to realize their potential through the provision of public responsibility for the means to achieve \"Mathematical Maturity\" in full and in detail. To gain an understanding of the nuances of this concept, it is enough to delve into just one topic of elementary school mathematics curriculum. Select an arbitrarily unit segment, build two segments with lengths of ordinary fractions with different denominators and make sure that it is impossible to compare them in length in numerical terms. Then, appreciate the remarkable ability of Mathematics, to provide a solution to what would otherwise appear to be an insoluble problem. \n\nIn the educational process, it is essential to differentiate between the state and the student. The first provides the opportunity to obtain knowledge, but is not to answer for the second. However, there must be moral and material motivation to obtain high-quality knowledge. In his teachings, wise Abay cautioned that the word from the educated though demanding, can illuminate the path to understanding. He urged to perceive the light and mystery that surrounds us. With his words \"Aitshy-aytshyp zhalynar, Uqqysh zhansyp shabynar. Uqpay zhatyp zhaly\u01f5ar, u\u0131qyly-o\u0131a\u00fd bo\u0131k\u00fa\u0131ez\", which translates as \u2018mindless boredom, drowsiness\u2019, he emphasised the importance of remaining alert and awake to the world around us. In the absence of boredom, sleepiness\", as in the case of personal transformation of the individual and the principle of \"you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink\". \n\nThe concept of \"Justice\" is a multifaceted topic in the International Educational Space. It is the universal division between \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\", where the former has a stronger economy, infrastructure and technology, while the latter is characterized by less diverse economy, by poverty and inequality and a history of colonization by the countries of the Global North. These studies adopt from various points of views: sociological, economic, pedagogical, legal and political, as well as various professional approaches such as \"Fair education from the standpoint of textbook quality\" or \"Development and implementation of programs that take into account the needs of different groups of students\", \"Evaluation of the effectiveness of pedagogical strategies aimed at eliminating educational inequality\", and \"The role of technology in providing access to education\", etc.\n\nThis article is a presents a methodically structured National Program of the Republic of Kazakhstan, based on many years of experience and previously developed ideas, the result will be noticeable in a few years.\n\nEvery hour of delay makes one math lesson in all classes and for each student unschoolable, and damages the State in man-hours in the number of all students: \"I, Nurlan Temirgaliyev, as a direct specialist, demand to declare a \"State of emergency for the current state of mathematics and computer science of the Republic of Kazakhstan!\" dated 04/13/2015 and, earlier, since 1974; \"Save the future of a capable boy Imanbek\" dated 01/31/2019; \"Galiya Taugynbayeva alone can conduct an indisputable examination of all approved by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 13 calendar days textbooks on school mathematics\" dated 07/12/2020; \"The education and Science system of 30-year-old independent Kazakhstan turns a Kazakh, even if with the rudiments of Ramanujan's thinking, into a Mathematical Mowgli\" dated 11/14/2021; \"The academic year ended 2023-2024 for 5 million teachers and students was non-educational in all School mathematics, in Higher education in all specialties based on Mathematics, and this is in the presence of the National ITMiNV Program for elevation in Mathematics, Computer Science and AI-ML to World leading positions, which cannot be ordered with execution even for 10 annual budgets of the Republic of Kazakhstan\" from 1.07.2024; \"Admission to teaching \"First, complete theoretical training in the subject, only then the methodology, including understanding the accessibility or inaccessibility to assimilation by students and not the other way around\" on the example of just one problematic topic \"Comparison of ordinary fractions with different denominators of \"Elementary school\".

    "title": "Contribution of the Open Access Modality to the Impact of Hybrid Journals Controlling by Field and Time Effects",
    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Researchers are more likely to read and cite papers to which they have access than those that they cannot obtain. Thus, the objective of this work is to analyze the contribution of the Open Access (OA) modality to the impact of hybrid journals. Design/methodology/approach The \u201cresearch articles\u201d in the year 2017 from 200 hybrid journals in four subject areas, and the citations received by such articles in the period 2017\u20132020 in the Scopus database, were analyzed. The hybrid OA papers were compared with the paywalled ones. The journals were randomly selected from those with share of OA papers higher than some minimal value. More than 60 thousand research articles were analyzed in the sample, of which 24% under the OA modality. Findings We obtain at journal level that cites per article in both hybrid modalities (OA and paywalled) strongly correlate. However, there is no correlation between the OA prevalence and cites per article. There is OA citation advantage in 80% of hybrid journals. Moreover, the OA citation advantage is consistent across fields and held in time. We obtain an OA citation advantage of 50% in average, and higher than 37% in half of the hybrid journals. Finally, the OA citation advantage is higher in Humanities than in Science and Social Science. Research limitations Some of the citation advantage is likely due to more access allows more people to read and hence cite articles they otherwise would not. However, causation is difficult to establish and there are many possible bias. Several factors can affect the observed differences in citation rates. Funder mandates can be one of them. Funders are likely to have OA requirement, and well-funded studies are more likely to receive more citations than poorly funded studies. Another discussed factor is the selection bias postulate, which suggests that authors choose only their most impactful studies to be open access. Practical implications For hybrid journals, the open access modality is positive, in the sense that it provides a greater number of potential readers. This in turn translates into a greater number of citations and an improvement in the position of the journal in the rankings by impact factor. For researchers it is also positive because it increases the potential number of readers and citations received. Originality/value Our study refines previous results by comparing documents more similar to each other. Although it does not examine the cause of the observed citation advantage, we find that it exists in a very large sample.",

    "title": "Establishing ABET Accreditation Criteria for Data Science",
    "abstract": "Prompted by the skyrocketing demand for data scientists, progress made by the ACM Data Science Task Force on defining data science competencies, and inquiries about data science accreditation, ABET is in the process of developing accreditation criteria for undergraduate data science programs. The effort is led by members of a joint data science criteria subcommittee appointed by ABET's Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) and CSAB (the lead society for computing accreditation). Establishing data science accreditation criteria is a notable milestone in the maturing data science discipline, indicating the presence of an accepted body of knowledge, standards of practice, and ethical codes for practitioners. This position paper motivates the effort and discusses prior work towards defining data science education requirements. It describes the ongoing process for creating and obtaining approval of the accreditation criteria, and how feedback was and will be solicited from the computing and statistical communities. The current draft data science criteria, which was approved in July 2020 by the relevant ABET bodies for a year of public review and comment, is presented. These criteria emphasize the three pillars of data science: computing foundations, mathematical/statistical foundations, and experience in at least one data application domain. This report thus serves both to inform and to stimulate the academic discussion needed to finalize appropriate data science accreditation by ABET.",

    "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic resulted in education being shifted online, including in developing countries. Developing countries frequently have lower levels of Internet penetration than developed countries. Thus, one of the fears with the transition to online education was that students would be disenfranchised. At one university in a developing country the institution's learning management system (LMS) logs all user (students and faculty) activity. Using these logs we study how student activity in an undergraduate computer networking course has evolved in three offerings--two from the 2018/19 and 2019/20 academic years before the pandemic and the other from the 2020/21 year during the pandemic. The data show that the average number of LMS transactions per student went up during the COVID pandemic compared to the number prior to the pandemic. While this finding is not unexpected, given that students were being instructed online, other data from the logs points to some interesting trends. For example, there is a statistically significant difference in the number of clicks on embedded URLs within the LMS across the years. Other data show that students did not attend lectures or tutorials (discussion sections) as much as expected, and that the number of students \"attending'' online class sessions declined over the course of the semester. We provide reasons for these trends.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of an integrated approach of STEM education with real-life scenarios is crucial to motivate students to learn and to better prepare them for real-world challenges, which is a big challenge for teachers. Therefore, there are implications for teaching practice and consequently the need for professional development. This paper presents an integrated approach of STEM education developed in the context of a collaborative professional development programme implemented in an exclusive online context, provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic. The programme aimed at providing teachers with knowledge and skills to develop STEM integrated tasks to be implemented in class. This study used a quantitative\u2013qualitative approach to answer the research questions, using mixed methods to collect data. Participants are primary school teachers who participated in the programme during four months in the school year 2020/2021. Based on data collected from questionnaires, participant observation and teachers\u2019 final reports, it was verified that teachers recognized the importance of obtaining training in STEM education and that this type of professional development was very relevant and improved their knowledge and skills to implement STEM hands-on practices in class. In addition, a case study of a science and mathematics 6th grade teacher is presented to illustrate how she implement integrated STEM tasks in class based on a real-world scenario such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, teachers recognized the importance of this approach and that it increases students\u2019 motivation to learn.",

    "abstract": "Received: September 29, 2021 Revised: November 17, 2021 Accepted: February 21, 2022 Edited by Kangho Jung, National Institute of Crop Science, RDA, Korea ORCID Yang-Min Kim https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6246-5845 Chan-Wook Lee https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8901-8631 Ye-Jin Lee https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4415-846X The standard growth-stage-based fertigation schedule has provided the weekly supply amount of fertilizer considering the expecting yield with no regard of soil nutrient status. The study aimed to examine if fertigation with nitrogen applied at a standard rate results in the best cucumber yield in two greenhouses with different soil nutrient levels, i.e. optimal and high. We investigated the nitrogen (N) uptake pattern of cucumbers with the different nitrogen supply levels which included half the standard rate (N0.5), the standard rate (N1) and double the standard rate (N2). In year 2020, the N1 amendment resulted in highest yield in the soil with optimal nutrient level, however, lower N0.5 resulted in higher yield in the high-nutrient soil. In year 2021, there was no statistical difference in the yield by different nitrogen supply levels in both soils with optimal and high nutrient level. Soil NO3-N remained low in the low nutrient soil regardless of the amount of N supplied, but soil NO3-N was high in the high nutrient soil supplied with N2. The Partial Factor Productivity of Nitrogen (PFPN) was highest in the N0.5 and it decreased as N supply increased in the optimal and high nutrient soil. In conclusion, a precise fertigation schedule is needed to be set with the consideration of the soil nutrient status.",

    "abstract": "The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is a key Earth science parameter used to assess vegetation, originally developed and calibrated for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. With the impending decommissioning of the MODIS sensors by the year 2020/2022, alternative platforms will need to be used to estimate EVI. We compared Landsat 5 (2000\u20132011), 8 (2013\u20132016) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS; 2013\u20132016) to MODIS EVI (2000\u20132016) over a 420,083-ha area of the arid lower Colorado River Delta in Mexico. Over large areas with mixed land cover or agricultural fields, we found high correspondence between Landsat and MODIS EVI (R2 = 0.93 for the entire area studied and 0.97 for agricultural fields), but the relationship was weak over bare soil (R2 = 0.27) and riparian vegetation (R2 = 0.48). The correlation between MODIS and Landsat EVI was higher over large, homogeneous areas and was generally lower in narrow riparian areas. VIIRS and MODIS EVI were highly similar (R2 = 0.99 for the entire area studied) and did not show the same decrease in performance in smaller, narrower regions as Landsat. Landsat and VIIRS provide EVI estimates of similar quality and characteristics to MODIS, but scale, seasonality and land cover type(s) should be considered before implementing Landsat EVI in a particular area.",

    "abstract": "In the midst of a global pandemic and heightened national attention to the pervasiveness and impact of systemic racism, the 13 Annual Conference on the Science of Dissemination and Implementation in Health focused on the theme of \u201cDissemination and Implementation Science in a Dynamic, Diverse, and Interconnected World: Meeting the Urgent Challenges of our Time.\u201d Cohosted by the National Institutes of Health and AcademyHealth in collaboration with our co-sponsors the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), and the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the conference was held virtually December 15-17, 2020. While many virtual events attract fewer attendees than their in-person counterparts, the 2020 conference had the highest number of registrants: 1,587. As in prior years, a majority of attendees work in academic settings while 100 were students, 28 were patient scholarship recipients, and 133 participants joined us from 29 lowand middle-income countries. Over the three-day agenda, we hosted keynote and plenary sessions, concurrent podium and poster sessions, workshops and discussion forums, and multiple networking events. The call for abstracts generated 767 submissions, including individual paper presentations, individual posters, and panel presentations spread across nine thematic tracks. Over two hundred reviewers from multiple disciplines, sectors, settings, and career stages comprehensively assessed the abstracts within each track, coordinated by the track leads. New this year, we piloted a streamlined process for developing concurrent sessions for multiple tracks: We increased the number of reviewers per abstract for more robust scores, which were then used by track leads to assemble thematically relevant concurrent sessions among the most rigorous submissions. Both track leads and reviewers were extremely positive about the new process which we will fully implement going forward. This supplement includes 112 abstracts from the concurrent paper and panel sessions which represents a variety of dissemination and implementation research funded by our conference sponsors as well as other agencies, organizations, and systems. As in previous years, the conference was organized into nine thematic tracks: Behavioral Health, Clinical Care Settings (separated into two tracks: Patient-Level Interventions and System-Level Interventions), Global Dissemination and Implementation Science, Promoting Health Equity and Eliminating Disparities, Health Policy Dissemination and Implementation Science, Prevention and Public Health, and Models, Measures and Methods, and Building the Future of D & I Science: Training, Infrastructure, and Emerging Research Areas. This supplement is organized by these track themes. Slides and recordings of plenary and concurrent sessions (with the agreement of the authors) were posted on the conference website for 90 days after the conference. The additional 402 abstracts from the poster sessions are not included here but can be viewed at https://academyhealth.confex.com/academyhealth/2020di/meetingapp.cgi/ModulePosterSessions/0. The scientific programming for the conference was driven by the ongoing partnership between the NIH and AcademyHealth with substantial support from a multidisciplinary program planning committee which informed the plenary sessions, recruited key speakers, and helped to develop the topics for workshops and discussion forums. Our keynote and three plenary panels all turned their attention to the challenges of and opportunities in addressing the global health crises and how D&I science can provide direct benefit to ongoing issues of access, implementation and scale-up of evidence-based care. Dr. Ashish Jha opened the conferences with a talk on \u201cThe Pandemic Response: Misadventures in Evidence, Communication, and Implementation\u201d highlighting the challenges of effective communication and implementation in the face of rapidly evolving evidence, as well as the limitations in that evidence, particularly regarding systematically documenting health disparities. Dr. Jha highlighted the challenges of actions in the face of limited evidence as well as the challenges of misinformation and disinformation and emphasized the importance of humility particularly among our public health leaders. He concluded with three recommendations for the Implementation Science 2021, 16(Suppl 1):49 https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-021-01110-6",

    "abstract": "Higher education is at a crossroads (Blumenstyk 2015; DeMillo 2013). Students face unfathomable debt (Mitchell 2019; Tatham 2019), the liberal arts are under siege (Caplan 2018; Dutt-Ballerstadt 2019), and there is a growing number of less expensive educational alternatives to a university education (Craig 2018; Schroeder 2019). Compounding this is the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, which has amplified budget shortfalls and declining student enrollments, forcing higher-education institutions to lay off and/or furlough staff and faculty (Bauman 2020;Nietzel 2020). Colleges and universities are rethinking their modus operandi. Academic disciplines, particularly those in the liberal arts, should as well. Yet, it has been three decades since the American Political Science Association (APSA) commissioned guidelines for the political science major (Wahlke 1991). APSA recognizes that the discipline needs updated guidelines; it sponsored a conference on the topic in June 2019. Why now? The 2000s experienced record highs in political science degrees awarded, eclipsing 40,000 per year multiple times. In contrast, numbers in the past five years have fallen dramatically by more than 5,000 or approximately 12.5% (Jackson 2018). Historically, degrees awarded have followed a cyclical pattern; numbers could rebound. However, higher education did not face such dire challenges in the past. Exploring ways that the discipline can attract new (probably minority, likely Hispanic) political science majors is imperative (Fraga et al. 2011).",

    "title": "Training Teaching Assistants by Offering an Introductory Course",
    "abstract": "Teaching assistants (TAs) are often used in computer science (CS) courses to conduct tutorials in smaller groups and to be able to provide students with one-to-one help sessions. TAs can also assist with the assessment, which can be time-consuming in large classes. Previous research does, however, indicate that TAs can be poorly prepared for their work tasks. In this experience report, we present a TA training course that addresses this issue and prepares new TAs for their responsibilities. This includes conducting tutorials, tutoring and providing students with useful feedback in lab settings, and conducting assessments. In addition, we also aimed at creating a safe space for our TAs to discuss challenges and fears that they foresee or have already experienced as TAs. To do this, we developed an introductory course consisting of five modules, that are based on previous research on TAs in CS and in the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework. The modules are: HR questions, classroom teaching, helping and supervising in lab sessions, assessment, and reflection and discussion. The course is given in a blended learning format, where the first three modules are student-paced online modules, while the last two are synchronous meetings. To evaluate the training, we present course evaluation results from 53 TAs who enrolled in this 6-hours course during the 2020/2021 academic year. We conclude that this TA training course has been well appreciated by almost all the participants, discuss lessons learned and future plans.",

    "abstract": "Background: In this first article of what is planned to be an annual series, we examine the history of cancer prevalence reporting and the role that these annual figures play in guiding the direction of cancer control research, and specifically the science of cancer survivorship. For this inaugural year, we focus on the confluence of the growing number of survivors and population aging, and the impact these combined trends will have on cancer survivorship in the future. Methods: State or metro area-level cancer incidence and prevalence data were collected from 9 registries via the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. The complete prevalence method was used to estimate prevalence for 2008 and the Prevalence, Incidence Approach Model method was used to project prevalence data through 2020, assuming flat cancer incidence and survival trends but dynamic U.S. population projections. Results: As of January 2008, the number of cancer survivors is estimated at 11.9 million. Approximately 60% of cancer survivors are age 65 or older, and by the year 2020, it is estimated that 63% of cancer survivors will be age 65 or older. Conclusions: Improved survival and population aging converge to generate a booming population of older adult cancer survivors, many of whom have multiple complex health conditions and unique survivorship needs. This demographic shift has important implications for future health care needs and costs of the U.S. population. Impact: The findings provide information critical for guiding cancer prevention and control research and service provision.

    "title": "Automating the Acoustic Detection and Characterization of Sea Ice and Surface Waves",
    "abstract": "Monitoring the status of Arctic marine ecosystems is aided by multi-sensor oceanographic moorings that autonomously collect data year-round. In the northeast Chukchi Sea, an ASL Environmental Sciences Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler (AZFP) collected data from the upper 30 m of the water column every 10\u201320 s from 2014 to 2020. We here describe the processing of the AZFP\u2019s 455 kHz acoustic backscatter return signal for the purpose of developing methods to assist in characterizing local sea ice conditions. By applying a self-organizing map (SOM) machine learning algorithm to 15-min ensembles of these data, we are able to accurately differentiate between the presence of open water and sea ice, and thereby characterize statistical properties surface wave height envelopes and ice draft. The ability to algorithmically identify small-scale features within the information-dense acoustic dataset enables efficient and rich characterizations of environmental conditions, such as frequency of sparse ice floes in otherwise open water and brief open-water leads amidst the ice pack. Corrections for instrument tilt, speed of sound, and water level allow us to resolve the sea surface reflection interface to within approximately 0.06 \u00b1 0.09 m. By automating the acoustic data processing and alleviating labor- and time-intensive analyses, we extract additional information from the AZFP backscatter data, which is otherwise used for assessing fish and zooplankton densities and behaviors. Beyond applications to new datasets, the approach opens possibilities for the efficient extraction of new information from existing upward-looking sonar records that have been collected in recent decades.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to investigate the methodological quality and the effects of fundamental motor skills and physical activity interventions on cognitive and academic skills in 3- to 7-year-old children with special educational needs. The review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) statement. A literature search was carried out in April 2020 (updated in January 2022) using seven electronic databases, including ERIC, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed with Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool. Cohen\u2019s d effect sizes and post-hoc power analyses were conducted for the included studies. Altogether 22 studies (1883 children) met the inclusion criteria, representing children at-risk for learning difficulties, due to family background (nstudies = 8), children with learning difficulties (nstudies = 7), learning disabilities (nstudies = 5), and physical disabilities (nstudies = 2). Two of the included 22 studies displayed strong, one moderate, and 19 studies weak methodological quality. The intervention effects appeared to be somewhat dependent on the severity of the learning difficulty; in cognitive and language skills, the effects were largest in children at-risk due to family background, whereas in executive functions the effects were largest in children with learning disabilities. However, due to the vast heterogeneity of the included studies, and a rather low methodological quality, it is challenging to summarize the findings in a generalizable manner. Thus, additional high-quality research is required to determine the effectiveness of the interventions.",

See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ. Data extraction is the process of a systematic review that occurs between identifying eligible studies and analysing the data, whether it can be a qualitative synthesis or a quantitative synthesis involving the pooling of data in a metaanalysis. The aims of data extraction are to obtain information about the included studies in terms of the characteristics of each study and its population and, for quantitative synthesis, to collect the necessary data to carry out metaanalysis. In systematic reviews, information about the included studies will also be required to conduct risk of bias assessments, but these data are not the focus of this article. Following good practice when extracting data will help make the process efficient and reduce the risk of errors and bias. Failure to follow good practice risks basing the analysis on poor quality data, and therefore providing poor quality inputs, which will result in poor quality outputs, with unreliable conclusions and invalid study findings. In computer science, this is known as \u2018garbage in, garbage out\u2019 or \u2018rubbish in, rubbish out\u2019. Furthermore, providing insufficient information about the included studies for readers to be able to assess the generalisability of the findings from a systematic review will undermine the value of the pooled analysis. Such failures will cause your systematic review and metaanalysis to be less useful than it ought to be.",

    "abstract": "\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Reuse permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ. INTRODUCTION The emergence of SARSCoV-2 in the end of 2019, an aetiologic agent responsible for the SARS plunged the world into an unprecedented sanitary crisis. Papers on COVID-19 have been fasttracked since then. Accelerated time from submission to publication and qualitative changes in peer review, associated with empirical evidence that duplicate and implausible clinical trials have been carried out during the pandemic, could perhaps imply lower quality of peer review in COVID-19 research. Accumulating empirical evidence has also been indicating the pandemic era output to be less reliable than its prepandemic counterpart. 10\u201314 A systematic review to evaluate the methodological quality of COVID-19 peerreviewed clinical studies compared with historical controls found methodological quality scores to be lower in COVID-19 articles across all study designs. Meanwhile, data sharing practices remained largely unchanged during the first year of the pandemic. 14 With no mandates of data sharing in place for COVID-19 studies, the reproducibility of these data on COVID-19 is yet to be independently verified as well. However, more efficiency in scientific publication did manifest in accelerated publication, journals tearing down their paywalls for their COVID-19 output, an increased usage of life and medical sciences preprint servers to increase speed and transparency, not to mention the intense international collaboration that resulted in the development of multiple highefficacy vaccines within the first year of the pandemic. On the other hand, some pratices that reduce the reliability of clinical trials may have gained some traction during 2020, such as executing underpowered studies with small samples, multiplicity of trials testing ideas with low prior probability of being true, forgoing blinding to test interventions 11 14 17\u201320 and incomplete reporting of findings, which was already an issue before the pandemic. 21 To what extent that has dominated the general output in medical interventions for COVID-19 and how much of it turned into actual clinical pratice is something that has not yet been thoroughly assessed and is, thus, still open for debate. 14 Notwithstanding, it is likely that poor science, even if it being the exception within an overall output, when carelessly amplified within a context of sanitary crisis and political polarisation, may be consequential, as it has been the case of the now infamous hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) study, that strengthened a trend in nonevidencebased interventions for COVID-19 and divided the Brazilian medical community to this date. 24 The mechanism of how that type of misinformation plays out in the current media environment is the topic of interest of this brief communication as disseminating scientific findings through press releases and press conferences but without timely access to the study nor to its data has also gained some traction in 2020 in Brazil. 14 25 Below, we briefly discuss how a small set of exceptionally poorly designed studies disseminated through the press, weeks or months before publication and without access to the data sets used to generate these studies for a more thorough assessment, played into a cycle of misinformation in Brazil in the first year of the pandemic. And, to conclude, we suggest a programme of scientific investigation aimed to properly examine and address coright.",

    "abstract": "Energy-efficiency has become a critical parameter in the design of high-performance computing systems. Typically, compute elements consume the most energy in current systems, with memories and interconnect networks close behind. This paper proposes an energy-efficient, high-connectivity, petascale computing system for the year 2020 timeframe by addressing the energy requirements of these three components. We start with projections based on purely evolutionary computer system design trends, then include the impact of breakthroughs in processor design, memory packaging and optical interconnect technologies. Based on these projections, we motivate the development for a 1-pJ/b optical intrasystem interconnect technology that significantly increases system interconnect bandwidth and relieves the distance-based energy dependence of electrical alternatives. We show that improvements in compute, memory, and IO, when simultaneously applied, become a vision for many-chip photonically-interconnected modules that could lead to an order of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency in the 2020 timeframe. The vision hinges on a high-density, energy-efficient optical link that can connect electronic compute and memory elements across short chip-to-chip distances while also capable of kilometer or longer spans across data centers. We discuss the power budget to enable such a link and review experimental progress toward creating an ultra-dense, hybrid-integrated low-power silicon photonic link that will enable this vision.",

    "abstract": "Continuous remote-sensing monitoring of sand in desert areas and the exploration of the spatio\u2013temporal evolution characteristics of soil\u2013wind erosion has an important scientific value for desertification prevention and ecological restoration. In this study, the Kubuqi Desert was selected as the study area, and the Landsat series satellite remote sensing data, supplemented by satellite remote sensing data such as GE images, SPOT-5, ZY-3, GF-1/2/6, etc., integrated object-oriented, decision tree, and auxiliary human\u2013computer interaction interpretation methods, developed the Kubuqi Desert area dataset from 1990 to 2020, and established a soil erosion intensity database of the past 30 years based on the soil\u2013wind erosion correction equation. The results show that the application of the training samples obtained by a high-score collaborative ground sampling to land use/cover classification in desert areas can effectively improve the efficiency of remote-sensing mapping of sand changes and the accuracy of change information identification, and the overall accuracy of the classification results is 95%. In general, the sandy area of the Kubuqi Desert area has decreased year by year, during which the mobile sand in the hinterland of the desert has expanded in a scattered distribution. The overall soil\u2013wind erosion intensity showed a downward trend, especially since 2000; the ecological improvement trend after the implementation of desertification control projects is obvious. Changes in the sand type contributed the most to the reduction of soil\u2013wind erosion intensity (contribution 81.14%), ecological restoration played a key role in reducing the soil\u2013wind erosion intensity (contribution 14.42%), and the increase of forest and grass vegetation covers and agricultural oases played a positive role in solidifying the soil- and wind-proof sand fixation. The pattern of sandy land changes in desert areas is closely related to the national ecological civilization construction policy and the impact of climate change.",

    "abstract": "While the neuroanatomical correlates of impulsivity in youths have been examined, there is little research on whether those correlates are consistent across childhood/adolescence. The current study uses data from the age 11/12 (N = 7,083) visit of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study to investigate the replicability of previous work (Owens et al., 2020) the neuroanatomical correlates of impulsive personality traits identified at age 9/10. Neuroanatomy was measured using structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, and impulsive personality was measured using the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale. Replicability was quantified using three Open Science Collaboration replication criteria, intraclass correlations, and elastic net regression modeling to make predictions across timepoints. Replicability was highly variable among traits: The neuroanatomical correlates of positive urgency showed substantial similarity between ages 9/10 and 11/12, negative urgency and sensation seeking showed moderate similarity across ages, and (lack of) premeditation and perseverance showed substantial dissimilarity across ages. In all cases, effect sizes between impulsive traits and brain variables were small. These findings suggest that, even for studies with large sample sizes and the same participant pool, the replicability of brain-behavior correlations across a 2-year period cannot be assumed. This may be due to developmental changes across the two timepoints or false-positive/false-negative results at one or both timepoints. These results also highlight an array of neuroanatomical structures that may be important to impulsive personality traits across development from childhood into adolescence.

    "title": "Bioethanol Producing from Sorghum Crops",
    "abstract": "The relevance of the article lies in a comprehensive analysis of the trend in the production of biofuels from crop products in Ukraine and other countries of the world. The purpose of the research was to justify on the basis of research by both their own and many authors that sorghum varieties are extremely important in cultivation due to changes in soil and climatic conditions. When conducting research, we used generally accepted methods, techniques and DSTU, in particular: the method of comparison, analysis and synthesis, laboratory and field. Computer methods of information processing and visualization of research results using the Microsoft Office program were also used. According to the results of research, it was found that with less favorable temperature conditions and moisture supply in 2020 yr., grain sorghum crops formed a yield depending on the hybrid in the range of 2.1-6.9 t/ha, in a more favorable year for these indicators in 2021 yr. it was at the level of 6.9-14.5 t/ha, and on average for two years it was in the range of 4.5-10.7 t/ha. Performance stability was determined in the U 60117 IG and Bianca hybrids. On average, over two years, the theoretical yield of biofuels, depending on the hybrid, ranged from 2216 up to 5199 l/ha with a starch content in the grain of more than 75%. The highest estimated alcohol yield per unit area was in the grain sorghum hybrid U 60116 IG, which combines a stable yield (10.7 t/ha) with a high starch content in the grain (75%). Treatment of sugar sorghum crops with biologics and microfertilizers had a positive effect on the yield of structural units per hectare: compared to the control, the yield of leaves during organic balance processing increased by 2.66 t/ha, the yield of panicles \u2013 by 1.56 t/ha, and stems \u2013 by 3.64 t/ha. The increase in the conditional yield of sugars relative to the control of treatment with Quantum microfertilizers was 0.354 t/ha, organic balance \u2013 0.417 t/ha, and with their combined action \u2013 1.143 t/ha, which was the maximum value",

    "abstract": "India is ranked fifth in the world in terms of COVID-19 publications accounting for 6.7% of the total. About 60% of the COVID-19 publications in the year 2020 are from United States, China, UK, Italy, and India. We present a bibliometric analysis of the publication trends and citation structure along with the identification of major research clusters. By performing network analysis of authors, citations, institutions, keywords, and countries, we explore semantic associations by applying visualization techniques. Our study shows lead taken by the United States, China, UK, Italy, India in COVID-19 research may be attributed to the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in those countries witnessing the first outbreak and also due to having access to COVID-19 data, access to labs for experimental trials, immediate funding, and overall support from the govt. agencies. A large number of publications and citations from India are due to co-authored publications with countries like the United States, UK, China, and Saudi Arabia. Findings show health sciences have the highest number of publications and citations, while physical sciences and social sciences and humanities counts were low. A large proportion of publications fall into the open-access category. With India as the focus, by comparing three major pandemics\u2014SARS, MERS, COVID-19\u2014from a bibliometrics perspective, we observe much broader involvement of authors from multiple countries for COVID-19 studies when compared to SARS and MERS. Finally, by applying bibliometric indicators, we see an increasing number of sustainable development-related studies from the COVID-19 domain, particularly concerning the topic of good health and well-being. This study allows for a deeper understanding of how the scholarly community from a populous country like India pursued research in the midst of a major pandemic which resulted in the closure of scientific institutions for an extended time.",

    "title": "Development of an Anatomy Attitude Scale for Medical School Students and Analysis of Their Attitudes",
    "abstract": "Anatomy is one of the most fundamental areas of medical sciences. When medical education is given in its \"normal\" course, primarily macroscopic anatomy education and other basic medical sciences form the foundation, and then the clinical medical sciences are built on top of this foundation. Due to its importance, as mentioned above, it is known to be a course feared by students newly starting their medical education. A literature search showed that there was not an \"Anatomy Attitude Scale\" that questions the views of medical school students in our country about anatomy. This study aims to develop a scale to reveal the attitudes of medical school students towards anatomy validly and reliably and to investigate anatomy attitudes of medical school students using this scale in a pilot administration. This study included 700 Term 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 students studying in the School of Medicine of \u00c7anakkale Onsekiz Mart University (\u00c7OMU) in the academic year 2020-2021 who agreed to take part in the study. Of these students, 345 were recruited for factor analysis and 355 for investigation of attitudes. In the study, an Anatomy Attitude Scale was developed first in line with the literature, which consisted of 14 items and 3 subfactors, \"Value of Anatomy\", \"Hating Anatomy\", and \"Time Allocated to Anatomy\". The results of construct validity were also verified by confirmatory factor analysis. Then, the scale was administered to 355 students. The results obtained from the data showed that the students of \u00c7OMU Medical School were aware of the importance of anatomy as a fundamental medical science, and the physician candidates who intended to become a specialist in any branch in the future attributed more value to Anatomy. We believe that the \"Anatomy Attitude Scale\" we have developed as a result of this study will help shape medical education in our country.",

    "title": "Review of Cashless Economy in Nigeria and the Challenges of Network Infrastructures",
    "abstract": "The central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) conceptualized the idea of Cashless Economy in 2011 as part of its blueprint to drive economic development and modernise our payment system in line with the Nation\u2019s Vision 2020 goal of being amongst the twenty most developed economies by the year 2020. The Apex bank of Nigeria then came up with a cashless policy with the view of pegging the amount of physical cash to be withdrawn or deposited at a time in commercial banks. The pilot scheme kick started in Lagos, Kano, Anambra and some other states of Nigeria\u2019s major commercial cities with intention of spreading across all the states of federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It was designed to reduce but not eliminate the amount of physical cash in circulation and encourage more electronic driven transaction channels. A number of researchers agree that this initiative by the CBN is anchored on the fact that an efficient and digitized payment system positively correlates with economic development, which is believed to be a key indicator for economic growth provided that all other factors are constant. This policy involves deployment of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) gadgets through Computer Network Infrastructures. The Policy aims at reducing cost of banking services, improving the effectiveness of monetary policy in managing inflation as well as driving economic growth and development. However, since its inception, the policy has witnessed a number of challenges such as transaction failures resulting from poor network availability, hidden bank charges by commercial banks and cyber crime attacks. This research, therefore, is an opinion paper in which the researcher presents the challenges facing cashless policy in Nigeria and as well as proffer solutions to the identified challenges. A good number of cashless transaction channels were equally discussed and these include Electronic Cards, Automated Teller Machines (ATM), Mobile Banking, Online banking, Point of Sales (POS), and Near Field Communication (NFC). However, they all seem to have a common challenge (Network failures). The study recommends Five Nines availability (Network uptime of 99.999 percent) and Mesh Network design topology amongst others as recommendations.",

    "title": "Deep state phobia: Narrative convergence in coronavirus conspiracism on Instagram",
    "abstract": "Recent scholarship has established that conspiracist narratives proliferated in mainstream online discourse during the coronavirus pandemic. This proliferation has been provocatively characterized as a \u2018conspiracy singularity\u2019 in which previously divergent conspiracy narratives converged into a single, overarching narrative. Yet while the idea of narrative convergence has long figured in conspiracy theory research, empirical evidence has been scarce. The present article aims to address this gap by means of an investigation of an archive containing over 470,000 conspiracy-related Instagram posts from 2020. Given the size and conceptual complexity of the dataset, the paper introduces a \u2018digital hermeneutics\u2019 approach, which combines data science methods with qualitative interpretation and theorization. Operating across three levels of observation (hashtag analysis, text analysis, and image analysis) we identify patterns of convergence among different conspiracy narratives (including anti-vax, QAnon, anti-5G, and \u2018The Great Reset\u2019) over the year 2020 as well as the apparent role of protagonists and antagonists (notably Donald Trump and Bill Gates) in creating connections. In interpreting these findings we focus on the concept of \u2018the Deep State\u2019 as a bridge between various conspiracist narratives, which seems to cut diagonally across political ideologies.",

    "abstract": "To assess a future scenario of the world without a WTO, the present chapter projects the reader into the distant future of the year 2048 by which time the global community is aiming to establish GAIA, the so-called \u201cGlocal Agency in Anthropocene\u201d. GAIA is designed as the first truly integrated global institution with a universal character with the aim to tackle the complex and multiversal governance challenges of humanity and the planet as a whole. This chapter marks both a legally and a scientifically fictitious account of the years from 2020 until 2048, from a dystopian and a utopian perspective, with the aim of highlighting the importance of cognition for legal and institutional change. The need for cognitive change is driven by changes in the environment, and by the challenges resulting from a perceived acceleration of the pace of change and the unprecedented levels of technological complexity. Both change and complexity increase the relevance of cognition, as laws and policies adopted in one area are more likely to affect their success or failure and that of the global governance system as a whole. Thus, this chapter predicts that the foremost necessity for law in the future is to build on novel and enhanced modes of human cognition to deal better with complexity and rapid change.",

    "title": "An integrated approach to improve clinical trial efficiency: Linking a clinical trial management system into the Research Integrated Network of Systems",
    "abstract": "Abstract Low-accruing clinical trials delay translation of research breakthroughs into the clinic, expose participants to risk without providing meaningful clinical insight, increase the cost of therapies, and waste limited resources. By tracking patient accrual, Clinical and Translational Science Awards hubs can identify at-risk studies and provide them the support needed to reach recruitment goals and maintain financial solvency. However, tracking accrual has proved challenging because relevant patient- and protocol-level data often reside in siloed systems. To address this fragmentation, in September 2020 the South Carolina Clinical and Translational Research Institute, with an academic home at the Medical University of South Carolina, implemented a clinical trial management system (CTMS), with its access to patient-level data, and incorporated it into its Research Integrated Network of Systems (RINS), which links study-level data across disparate systems relevant to clinical research. Within the first year of CTMS implementation, 324 protocols were funneled through CTMS/RINS, with more than 2600 participants enrolled. Integrated data from CTMS/RINS have enabled near-real-time assessment of patient accrual and accelerated reimbursement from industry sponsors. For institutions with bioinformatics or programming capacity, the CTMS/RINS integration provides a powerful model for tracking and improving clinical trial efficiency, compliance, and cost-effectiveness.",

Setting: Single private institute, India \nMethods : Data from patients who underwent a laparoscopic primary dMGB from August 2020 to August 2021 by one surgeon were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were followed up at 3,6,9, and 12 months from the surgery date. Data were assessed using the Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System- II (BAROS- II) form based on three major areas: percentage weight loss, comorbidity resolution, and QoL. The variation in QoL was assessed using the Moorehead Ardelt QoL questionnaire, which addresses self-esteem, physical activity, social gathering, and sexual life. \nResults: Forty-one patients were included in the final analysis. The average age and pre-operative body mass index (BMI) was 45.5 yrs. and 44.5 kg/m2, respectively. The cohort had 60.9% of males and 39.1% females. The pre-operative average total QoL score was 0.65 \u00b1 0.2. At 12 months, the average BMI and average total QoL were 28.03 kg/m2 and 5.35 \u00b1 0.3, respectively, p<0.001. \nConclusion: At one year, the dMGB surgery effectively improves the overall QoL. \nBangladesh Journal of Medical Science Vol. 22 No. 04 October\u201923 Page : 759-767",

    "title": "Constraining the atmospheric limb of the plastic cycle",
    "abstract": "Significance Microplastic particles and fibers generated from the breakdown of mismanaged waste are now so prevalent that they cycle through the earth in a manner akin to global biogeochemical cycles. In modeling the atmospheric limb of the plastic cycle, we show that most atmospheric plastics are derived from the legacy production of plastics from waste that has continued to build up in the environment. Roads dominated the sources of microplastics to the western United States, followed by marine, agriculture, and dust emissions generated downwind of population centers. At the current rate of increase of plastic production (\u223c4% per year), understanding the sources and consequences of microplastics in the atmosphere should be a priority. Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental and social issues of the 21st century. Recent work has highlighted the atmosphere\u2019s role in transporting microplastics to remote locations [S. Allen et al., Nat. Geosci. 12, 339 (2019) and J. Brahney, M. Hallerud, E. Heim, M. Hahnenberger, S. Sukumaran, Science 368, 1257\u20131260 (2020)]. Here, we use in situ observations of microplastic deposition combined with an atmospheric transport model and optimal estimation techniques to test hypotheses of the most likely sources of atmospheric plastic. Results suggest that atmospheric microplastics in the western United States are primarily derived from secondary re-emission sources including roads (84%), the ocean (11%), and agricultural soil dust (5%). Using our best estimate of plastic sources and modeled transport pathways, most continents were net importers of plastics from the marine environment, underscoring the cumulative role of legacy pollution in the atmospheric burden of plastic. This effort uses high-resolution spatial and temporal deposition data along with several hypothesized emission sources to constrain atmospheric plastic. Akin to global biogeochemical cycles, plastics now spiral around the globe with distinct atmospheric, oceanic, cryospheric, and terrestrial residence times. Though advancements have been made in the manufacture of biodegradable polymers, our data suggest that extant nonbiodegradable polymers will continue to cycle through the earth\u2019s systems. Due to limited observations and understanding of the source processes, there remain large uncertainties in the transport, deposition, and source attribution of microplastics. Thus, we prioritize future research directions for understanding the plastic cycle.",

    "abstract": "A considerable range expansion of Dermacentor reticulatus has been observed in several European countries, which is concerning in the light of its vector function for several pathogens, including Babesia canis and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). The present study provides an update on the distribution of Dermacentor ticks in Germany, using a citizen science approach. Ticks were collected by citizens from March 2020 to May 2021, and submitted along with information on the date and location of collection, potential hosts and details about the circumstances of discovery. In total, 3,292 Dermacentor specimens were received, of which 76.4% (2,515/3,292) were identified as D. reticulatus and 23.0% (758/3,292) as D. marginatus, while 0.6% (19/3,292) were too damaged for species-level identification. Dermacentor reticulatus was received from all federal states of Germany. Maxent species distribution models predicted suitable environmental conditions for D. reticulatus throughout Germany. Findings on the vegetation or on pastured animals without travel history confirmed the occurrence of this tick species as far north as the most northern German federal state Schleswig-Holstein. In contrast, the distribution of D. marginatus still appears to be limited to southwestern Germany, although the northward shift of the distribution limit observed in the preceding citizen science study, as compared with previous published distributions, was confirmed. This shift was also predicted by Maxent species distribution models, reflecting the broader distribution of the tick occurrence data contributed by citizens. Most D. reticulatus ticks were found on dogs (1,311/1,960, 66.9%), while D. marginatus was mainly discovered on hoofed animals (197/621, 31.7%) and humans (182/621, 29.3%). Human tick bites were reported in 0.7% (14/1,960) of host-assigned D. reticulatus and 3.4% (21/621) of host-assigned D. marginatus. Further studies to investigate an increasing endemisation of Babesia canis in Germany as well as the relevance of D. reticulatus for TBEV spread throughout the country, e.g., by traveling dogs, are urgently needed. In view of the activity of D. reticulatus during winter or the colder months, which complements that of Ixodes ricinus, a year-round tick protection of at least dogs is strongly recommended.",

    "abstract": "Workplace spirituality provides an opportunity to understand the relationship between self and the workplace. The current study plans to explore the bibliometric analysis of workplace spirituality research papers that have been indexed in the Scopus database. Excel sheets were used to analyze the data in terms of frequency and percentage including the VOS viewer software tool used to create maps. Total 445 research papers were selected for this investigation which was published between the 2000 to 2020 span period. The analysis of the findings revealed instrumental knowledge, including annual publications, top contributing countries in publication, affiliation, top contributing authors, subject area, and type of publication. It is observed from the analysis that a high volume of the research was initiated from the United States of America followed by India and most of the research papers published in the year 2020 and the trend is showing inconsistency. The highest research area related to workplace spirituality comprises Business, Management and Accounting, Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, Economics Econometrics & Finance, Nursing, Medicine, and psychology. These findings will provide greater opportunities for future researchers to consider as a baseline before initiating a study on workplace spirituality research work.",

    "title": "Perceptions of stem students on the theory of evolution",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to describe how the STEM students perceive the relationship between their beliefs about science and religion or Christian beliefs. The respondents of this study are the grade 12 students of Antipolo City Senior High School during the school year 2020-2021. A questionnaire was administered in two sections of grade 12 STEM students. The researcher also conducted interview from 15 selected STEM students. This qualitative method was used to examine the learning experiences and perceptions of students on the theory of evolution and creationism. The findings of this study show that STEM students viewed science and religion as different ways of understanding the world. Teachers should make a clear distinction between the roles of science and religion; the two need not be in conflict. Teachers that develop a depth of knowledge beyond what is actually expected of students will be able to confidently adjust instruction in response to students' needs and inquiries. Despite scientific evidence presented by scientists on the legitimacy of evolution, many people still adhere to their religious or Christian beliefs. The researcher recommends that each of us should have given much respect to people's different beliefs because of different cultures and traditions. The researcher also recommends that if someone feels that the theory of evolution contradicts his/her belief, he needs to be open-minded for an in-depth understanding and to weigh things right for the enlightenment of oneself. Science and religion may provide answers to our existence in different approaches but for the well-being of everyone.\"",

    "abstract": "Pregnant women have a higher risk of serious illness during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This raises concerns about COVID-19 infection in pregnant women. Other than COVID-19, pregnant women are also a high-risk group for influenza infection. Influenza vaccination is used to prevent coinfection with COVID-19. Thus, this study examined the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women based on factors of worry about COVID-19 infection and a history of influenza vaccination. This study was a systematic review that assessed cross-sectional articles of the year 2020-2021 from the Pubmed, Science Direct, and Medrxiv databases with narrative analysis. There were three articles that met the criteria. The three articles showed significant relationships between concerns of being infected with COVID-19 and receiving COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in pregnant women, while a significant relationships between a history of influenza vaccination and accepting COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women were only found in two articles. Compared to the history of influenza vaccination, the concerns of being infected with COVID-19 in pregnant women were significantly more related to accepting COVID-19 vaccination, so it can be the focus of intervention to increase the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women.",

    "title": "Debates About EdTech in a Time of Pandemics Should Include Youth\u2019s Voices",
    "abstract": "The EdTech debate continues to gather attention among academia, digital rights and privacy advocates, and the general public. While much ink is spilled by EdTech critics, with best interest for students facing a datafied and platformised education at heart, youth\u2019s voice is rarely present. Much is written about what EdTech means for education processes and what they might do to students or for them than is said in their own words. With the pandemic having kept children and youth at a computer distance from each other and society for over a year, what has been happening in their lives during this time should be heard \u2013 in their own words. This article follows on two emergencies gripping education globally as highlighted during the 2020 United Nations Internet Governance Forum (IGF), emphasised by two IGF youth representatives. On one hand, the pandemic crisis has exacerbated digital inequalities worldwide; on the other, the \u2018overdigitisation\u2019 of education has increased the risks of dataveillance and privacy loss. These two extremes intersect in their techno-deterministic drive, which risks side-lining students\u2019 perspectives. To counter this risk, this paper brings these youths\u2019 perspectives and reflections over the dichotomy of \u2018none\u2019 versus \u2018too much\u2019 EdTech and what \u2018works\u2019 and does not in their learning in a time of pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Laryngology and laryngeal surgery have been in the vanguard of minimally invasive human procedural interventions for approximately 150 years. The natural passages through the oral cavity, nose, and pharynx have provided an accessible gateway to the larynx that has allowed for rapid translation of a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. Transoral and transcervical laryngeal surgery have been further facilitated by progressive advancements in local, topical, intravenous, and general anesthesia. With rapid developments in engineering disciplines (ie, tissue, chemical, mechanical) and voice science, there are a variety of current and near-term opportunities to advance our field. This report represents a panel at the 2005 American Broncho-Esophagological Association meeting that sought to use present perspectives, combined with cutting-edge research insights, to provide foresight into key aspects of laryngology that we believe will be developed by the year 2020. We hope that aspiring laryngeal surgeons will find elements of this discussion valuable for devising a strategic roadmap for research initiatives in laryngology and laryngeal surgery.",

    "abstract": "The potential of big science research infrastructures to make contributions far beyond their scientific purview has long been acknowledged. However, less consensus exists about the specific mechanisms with which such value can realised. This paper describes the ATTRACT project. A novel approach funded with \u20ac20 million by the European Commission Horizon 2020 programme, ATTRACT represents a consortium of leading European scientific centres, academic institutions, and industry associations formed to harness their world-class scientific instrumentation technologies towards entrepreneurship within European economies. ATTRACT will award 170 projects centred on breakthrough imaging and detection technologies \u20ac100,000 each to develop a proof-of-concept within one year. With the goal of scaling a select few of the most promising projects, ATTRACT will facilitate additional iterations of public and private funding along with relevant commercial and legal support to bridge the gap between supply-push and demand-pull innovation policy instruments. The paper describes the ATTRACT project: its motivation, philosophy, design, and results to date.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Investing in maintaining the trust of blood donors, the safety of blood and blood products and the effectiveness of health professionals is vital because it can enhance the attraction of donors.\nPurpose: The main purpose of this research is to highlight the most prevalent motivational factors of blood donation.\nMethodology: A mixed research project was conducted after quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used in the blood donation unit of the hospital with a sample of 416 blood donors, volunteers and nonvolunteers. Research questionnaires were formulated for the year 2020.The data was collected in the form of a specially designed questionnaire. The statistical analysis was performed with the software program\nStatistical Package for Social Sciences (IBMSPSS), version 22.0.\nResults: In a percentage of 70.7%, the majority of blood donors were men, aged 36-50 years old. The evaluation of the study results showed that the blood donors were volunteers in a percentage of 82.95%, while the remaining percentage of 17.1% were urged to donate blood, due to a need of a relative.\nConclusions: The findings of the study show the need for substantial interventions, application of better techniques and approach methods as well as maintenance of blood donors. The urge of people to donate blood constitutes a procedure of great importance which requires constant efforts. The sufficiency of blood is ensured only with constant, systematic blood donors.",

    "abstract": "Aims: The present investigation was carried out at SKUAST-Kashmir during the year 2020 to improve the seed vigour and germination potential of okra through pre-sowing seed treatments. \nStudy Design: The experiment was laid in completely randomized design (CRD) with three replications \nPlace and Duration of Study: The present investigation was carried out at the division of Basic Sciences and Humanities, SKUAST-Kashmir during the year 2020 \nMethodology: There were nine pre-sowing seed treatments comprised of simple seed soaking and seed priming with water (T1 and T5), -1.0MPa solution of PEG (T2 and T6), 100ppm solution of GA3 (T3 and T7) and 1.5% solution of KH2PO4 (T4 and T8), respectively along with untreated control (T0). Fifty seeds of each treatment were cultured in 14.0cm Petri dishes lined with 10 layers of moist filter paper. Observations on various germination parameters were recorded at (25\u00b12\u00b0C). \nResults: Findings of the study revealed that seed soaking in water (T1) resulted in maximum FGP (93.3%) and GI (16.29) compared to other treatments. Discrete middling of different soaking (AvS) and priming (AvP) treatments indicated the novelty of seed priming over simple soaking. However, unlike FGP and GI, all other parameters viz., CVG, MGT, MGR, T50 and Z-index were found superior when seeds were primed in water (T5) with their recorded values of 87.34%day-1, 1.15day-1, 0.614 day-1, 1.18 day, 0.790, respectively. Values of CVG, MGR and Z index with respect to separate means of simple seed soaking, AvS (69.5%day-1, 0. 0.566day-1 and 0.53) and priming, AvP (75.6%day-1, 0.573day-1 and 0.63) further confirmed the dominancy of seed priming technique over simple seed soaking. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis revealed strong relationship between different quantities of seed germination attributes. \nConclusion: Seed priming resulted in better germination attributes in okra compared to tradirional seed soaking and as such priming treatments should be practiced instead of traditional seed soaking in okra.",

    "abstract": "Although vehicles may be used in a wide variety of suicides, this has not been a focus in the forensic literature. Thus, an analysis of coronial autopsy reports at Forensic Science SA, Adelaide, South Australia over a 16-year period from January 2005 to December 2020 was undertaken to provide an overview of cases in which it was considered that a vehicle had been integral to the successful completion of a suicide. De-identified details were collected from all cases in which a vehicle had facilitated or been used as a method of suicide. A number of different types of vehicle-related suicide methods were identified, including cases where vehicles had been used as secure places for suicide or where the vehicle had been used to cause significant blunt force trauma or to enter a lethal environment such as water. Specific examples were taken from the following categories: (1) inhalation of gas, (2) drug toxicity, (3) hanging or ligature strangulation, (4) self-immolation, (5) drowning, (6) vehicle collision, (7) driving off a cliff, (8) jumping or lying in front of a vehicle and (9) the use of more than one method (i.e. complex). This report is not intended to provide an epidemiological analysis of car-related suicides. Instead, the details of selected cases have been used to illustrate the spectrum of methods that may be used in vehicle-assisted suicides.",

    "title": "Editorial: Recent Advances in Natural Methane Seep and Gas Hydrate Systems",
    "abstract": "Marine hydrocarbon seep emissions of methane, oil, and other trace gases can profoundly impact the marine, regional, and global environment. Cold seeps arise from petroleum hydrocarbon fields (thermogenic), biogenic sources, and gas hydrates (thermogenic and biogenic). Deeply sourced, energy-laden fluids percolate through the sediment column, undergoing continual alteration (Figure 1). Seeps come in many flavors and varieties, ranging from highly active mud volcanoes to relict hardgrounds of authigenic carbonates (Joye, 2020). This global geological methane source is estimated to be 63\u201380 Tg CH4 year , with marine seepage contributing 20\u201330 Tg CH4 year \u22121 (Etiope et al., 2019) or 5\u201310 Tg CH4 year (Saunois et al., 2020). An estimate of pre-industrial CH4 emissions\u2014which are not confounded with fossil fuel production emissions from ice core CH4 suggests an emission rate of 1.6 Tg CH4 year \u22121 (Hmiel et al., 2020). This lower estimate appears inconsistent with several recently published emissions from larger seep fields. Underlying this debate is the paucity of quantitative studies, with challenges arising from the known spatial and temporal heterogeneity in seepage and the difficulty of doing seep science in some areas (e.g., the Arctic). Geological controls underlie these heterogeneities\u2014particularly geological structures such as anticlines and faults that allow hydrocarbon accumulation and faults that allow migration to the seabed and atmosphere.",

    "title": "The integration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles into the power system of the Dubrovnik region",
    "abstract": "In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, governments seek to replace conventional fuels by renewable ones. Nowadays, most attention is paid to electric vehicles in the transport systems and the use of renewable energy in the power systems. The aim of this work is to achieve a 100 % renewable and sustainable system and to examine the impact of electrification in the transport sector on the power curve and the integration of renewable energy into the power systems of the Dubrovnik region up to 2050. The analyses of different charging regulation models for the electric vehicles were derived in the EnergyPLAN, which is a computer model for Energy Systems Analysis of the major energy systems and runs on an hourly basis. Calculations were done for selected years\u20142020, 2030 and 2050. Charging models provided in the EnergyPLAN were dumb charge, flexible demand, smart charge and smart charge with vehicle-to-grid. For each year, two different charging models were selected. Charging regulations according to three tariff models, based on a lower and higher electricity price, with different distributions, were also done for 2050, i.e. tariff model 1, 2 and 3. The results for the year 2020 showed no difference between the models. In 2030, smart charge gained better results than a flexible demand. In 2050, the flexible demand allowed to achieve better results than the smart charge with vehicle-to-grid and the tariff model 1, while tariff model 3 provided the best results for 2050. It is also shown that the energy systems which include electric vehicles have a greater impact on the reduction of a critical excess electricity production than the systems excluding electric vehicles. The power system of the Dubrovnik region was set up as an isolated system, and the electric vehicle batteries are the only storage provided. The results showed that each scenario yielded an excess in electricity produced in the system, which means that the available storage was insufficient and there was a need for more storage capacities in order to achieve a 100 % renewable and sustainable power system.",

    "title": "Ecological civilization: a revived perspective on the relationship between humanity and nature",
    "abstract": "This is a prodigious year for introspection by humanity about our relationship with nature.The year 2021 is marked with four important global meetings: the 44th session of the World Heritage Committee of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) scheduled in July, China; the IUCNWorldConservationCongress in September, France; the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in October, China; and the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in November, UK. All four meetings are germane to biodiversity conservation, and all will contribute to setting the future global agenda for conservation and sustainable development. In particular, CBD COP 15 will take the leading role in this regard, to review and adopt the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and associated implementation mechanisms for the 2030 mission and for the 2050 vision. These global targets aim to bend the curve of biodiversity loss [1] by effective efforts in conservation, restoration and sustainable production and consumption. How to formulate SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timebound) GBF targets to support and meet the goals is the major focus, and these targets must reflect and accommodate multiple viewpoints from different parties and relevant organizations. As the host party for CBD COP 15, China is working hard in cooperation with the CBD Secretariat and relevant parties and organizations to promote the preparation of the meeting, and the associated negotiations on key documents for COP 15.The theme for the COP, \u2018Ecological Civilization: building a shared future for all life on Earth\u2019, was officially released to reflect Chinesewisdom and philosophy. China promotes the development of ecological civilization and has made remarkable progress in realizing this vision. As Xi Jinping said, \u2018We need to take up our lofty responsibility for the entire human civilization, and we need to respect Nature, follow its laws and protect it. We need to find a way for man and nature to live in harmony, balance and coordinate economic development and ecological protection, and work together to build a prosperous, clean and beautiful world\u2019 [2]. COP 15 offers an opportunity for the world to better know and understand China. In this sense, we organized a special collection of papers to showcase the critical views and research progress in biodiversity science and conservation by the academic community of China together with international colleagues. Wei et al. presents the philosophical underpinnings, institutional frameworks and accomplishments of ecological civilization in China. Serving as an agent for transformative change, the concept of ecological civilization and associated actions in China provides important insights and great potential to build a shared future for all life on Earth. We hope that China\u2019s experiences can stimulate a global conversation onhowbest to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the goal of living in harmonywith nature in amanner that respects diverse national contexts [3]. Ecological civilization is an eco-innovation, rooted in the traditional wisdom of Unity of Nature and Humanity, to harmonize the apparent contradiction between economic development and environmental protection, including biodiversity conservation. As biodiversity is a multifaceted issue intertwined with human development, integrated approaches are needed to simultaneously achieve the conservation goals and related human well-being improvements, and to seek a balance in the conceptual framework of Unity of Nature and Humanity [4]. As a critical priority, countries need to design and implement integrated national strategies to achieve the goals of the three RioConventions (including theUNConvention toCombatDesertification\u2014UNCCD,UNFCCCandCBD)using spatially explicit analyses and policies. This integration can maximize co-benefits and help manage trade-offs to meet the SDGs, and maximize the retention of biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Nature-based solutions (NBSs) provide an important framework for such integration. Countries can learn from experiences in China and elsewhere, such as Brazil\u2019s forest code to integrate nature, climate and sustainablemanagementof land and ocean, and work to include targeted conservation and restoration of nature into their long-term low-emission development strategies [5]. Setting targets for addressing major global concerns such as biodiversity loss is an essential prerequisite for concerted global action (both inside and outside multilateral environmental agreements). However, most operational targets are socio-political choices rather than science-based decisions. Andersen et al. defined what \u2018science-based\u2019 means in relation to \u2018science-based targets\u2019, and to differentiate between overall science-based targets (for the world) and specific science-based",

    "abstract": "How much is better information about climate change worth? Here, I use PAGE09, a probabilistic integrated assessment model, to find the optimal paths of CO2 emissions over time and to calculate the value of better information about one aspect of climate change, the transient climate response (TCR). Approximately halving the uncertainty range for TCR has a net present value of about $10.3 trillion (year 2005 US$) if accomplished in time for emissions to be adjusted in 2020, falling to $9.7 trillion if accomplished by 2030. Probabilistic integrated assessment modelling is the only method we have for making estimates like these for the value of better information about the science and impacts of climate change.",

    "title": "Explorations in quantum computing",
    "abstract": "By the year 2020, the basic memory components of a computer will be the size of individual atoms. At such scales, the current theory of computation will become invalid. A new field called \"quantum computing\" is emerging that is reinventing the foundations of computer science and information theory in a way that is consistent with quantum physics - the most accurate model of reality that is currently known. Remarkably, this new theory predicts that quantum computers can perform certain tasks breathtakingly faster than classical computers, and, better yet, can accomplish mind-boggling feats such as teleporting information, breaking supposedly \"unbreakable\" codes, generating true random numbers, and communicating with messages that betray the presence of eavesdropping. \"Explorations in Quantum Computing\" explains these burgeoning developments in simple terms, and describes the key technological hurdles that must be overcome in order to make quantum computers a reality. This book draws upon the very latest research and uses executable software simulations to help explain the material and allow the reader to experiment with the ideas behind quantum computers. This is the ideal text for anyone wishing to learn more about the next, perhaps \"ultimate,\" computer revolution.",

    "title": "Workshops Without Borders: Building an Online Community of Japan Scholars",
    "abstract": "DOI:10.1017/S1049096522000270 In June 2020, the Project on Middle East Political Science (POMEPS) launched a virtual research workshop for junior scholars to fill the void left by the cancelation of so many conferences and workshops due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 2021\u20132022 academic year, we expanded the virtual workshop dramatically to include 18 workshops dedicated to book manuscripts or journal-article manuscripts. Because of the format\u2019s flexibility, efficiency, and advantages for diversity and inclusion, we plan to continue it even when travel becomes possible again. There are costs and risks, however, that require attention. Overall, the move to virtual research workshops has been a resounding success. Since its launch, POMEPS has conducted 24 workshops, including 82 junior-scholar authors and 58 seniorscholar discussants. Each two-hour article workshop typically features three papers, each with one assigned discussant. The authors are asked to read the other two papers, whereas discussants may but are not required to do so. As the convener and moderator, I read all of the papers and provide a second set of comments to supplement the assigned discussant. Book workshops, which are more intense, typically last 90 minutes for one paper or three hours for two papers on related themes. Each book manuscript has two dedicated readers, in addition to myself and typically one other member of the selection committee. We conducted 11 virtual bookworkshops for the 2021\u20132022 academic year. The buy-in from theMiddle East political science (and broader Middle East studies) community has been phenomenal. Although we cannot offer honoraria, almost all invited discussants usually agree to participate. If they are unavailable, they often offer suggestions for alternatives\u2014which is useful when the topics of the papers or books are outside of the organizers\u2019 areas of expertise. A Zoom meeting will never be as much fun as an in-person seminar, but the relatively small size of the group keeps everyone engaged and allows for personal interactions. Authors do not present their manuscript, assuming that it has been read in advance, which maintains a high level of engagement because there are few long spans of only listening. The virtual format allows us to more fully include scholars based in theMiddle East and Europe, for whom it otherwisemight be prohibitively expensive and pose complicated visa issues. We can offer invitations without regard to physical distance or national location. As a result, scholars from the Middle East and Europe who otherwise might have been excluded for logistical or cost reasons can participate at a high level: 40 of the 82 article authors and eight of the 11 book authors participated from outside of the United States. This also allows us to forego extensive advance planning, travel arrangements and logistics, andmultiday disruptions. The selection process actively seeks applicants from outside of the usual elite institutional networks, on the assumption that junior scholars from top schools already have support from their institution and are networked into the scholarly community. POMEPS has definite plans to continue these workshops even after the world heals; however, there are disadvantages to the format. In general, we have not heard the common complaint that online sessions are alienating, non-interactive, or unproductive. The small size and engagement-oriented organization has resulted in dynamic and productive sessions. Zoom burnout is real, however. We have found that a session lasting more than a few hours is difficult to sustain, even for the most dedicated of us. Time zones also have been an issue\u2014we sometimes struggle to find workable times for participants who might be calling in from the West Coast of the United States and from Doha, Qatar. Moreover, there is no substitute for the informal time after inperson workshops sharing cocktails or dinner or an evening walk through a new city. We are concerned that the ease of virtual workshops will lead to a two-tier system in which non-U.S. based scholars benefit from feedback and professional development but remain excluded from the more informal social benefits of inperson events. A more significant concern about the potential for a selfdestructive dynamic is the tendency to overschedule because it is so easy and inexpensive to do so. The sheer volume of workshops enabled by the virtual format can be overwhelming, not only for the organizer who reads and comments on all of the papers almost weekly but also for the larger community. If we exhaust the pool of plausible readers and return multiple times to the same senior scholars, at some point, their enthusiasm for being a discussant inevitably will wane. Furthermore, it is possible that funders will observe the success of online models and become unwilling to fund the more expensive and unwieldy in-person events. That would be very disappointing because many new ideas and enduring partnerships are developed in those informal spaces of inperson conferences and workshops.\u25aa",

    "abstract": "This week the White House offered a more detailed look at its 2020 budget request to Congress. Last week9s outline promised savage cuts to science, and the additional numbers don9t soften the blow. President Donald Trump9s $4.7 trillion plan would slash federal spending on basic research by at least 10.5% for the fiscal year that begins 1 October. No major science agency is spared. The National Institutes of Health would see a cut of $5 billion, or 13%, to $34.4 billion, translating to the loss of about 3800 competitive research grants. The National Science Foundation (NSF) drops by $1 billion, or 12%, to $7.1 billion; the impact includes some 400 fewer research fellowships for graduate students. A 16.5% cut at the Department of Energy9s Office of Science, to $5.5 billion, would strike renewable energy and environmental research programs particularly hard. NASA9s science portfolio would see an 8% cut, to $6.3 billion, with the agency proposing to cancel the flagship Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as well several earth science missions. Numerous climate and environmental science programs at the Environmental Protection Agency and interior and agriculture departments also get the ax. Even basic science at the Department of Defense\u2014which the budget favors with an overall 5% increase\u2014would feel the pain, dropping 8% to $2.3 billion.",

Vision 20: 2020 seeks to position Nigeria among the 20 largest economies in the world by the year 2020. The theoretical element of this study is comprised of a comprehensive literature review that focuses on research pertinent to the topic of this inquiry. To this end, it offers an opportunity to define terms systematically and to view problems as always interrelated with other components of society. The empirical part of this study (N = 222) involved using the statistical package of the social sciences (SPSS) version 18 to evaluate and interpret the quality of ECE objectives that can be achieved when governments play an active role in establishing access and equity, standards and quality assurance, teacher training and funding, and the elimination of resource wastage. We explored the perception of respondents as expressed while completing the questionnaire for this study. We recognised the respondents as agents who were able to appreciate discourses to build a perspective that has a continuous and constant renegotiated quality.",

    "abstract": "Scientific ideas and hypotheses may be accepted, refuted, criticized, or subject to rebuttal by researchers (e.g., Mayo and Spanos, 2008). Dogmas do not belong to the territory of science, and ending up in uncharted territories should be the most encouraging and hopeful achievement for a researcher (Lampel, 2016). However, modern science is quite different than the ideal image of a scientist in a lab coat looking for new results or staring to the horizon. The scientific world, instead of being supported by inspiration in search of new ideas or deep thinking, is now dominated by other aspects (Byers, 2014; King et al., 2018). Scientists are meticulously evaluated by their work, i.e., scientific contributions, funded projects, student tuition, and outreach activities, among others (Bornmann and Marx, 2014). To be promoted or to get a permanent position, several \u201ctick boxes\u201d need to be filled, especially those concerning paper production and funding securing (e.g., Moher et al., 2018; Schimanski and Alperin, 2018). These are often disconnected from the genuine goals of science, such as producing out-of-the-box ideas that are generally difficult to spread and accept (Wang et al., 2017; Mairesse and Pezzoni, 2021) or subjecting previous proposals to empirical testing to explore their reliability, a type of task that Scheiner (2013) considered as deficient in ecology. Thus, most researchers spend their time trying to get the ball rolling in this environment (Milem et al., 2000; Link et al., 2008). We are living in a zeitgeist where the number of scientific contributions is steadily increasing year after year, with hundreds of thousands of available journals to showcase our work (Larsen and Von Ins, 2010; To and Yu, 2020). However, this spectacular increase of production is not correlated to the number of new ideas, ways of thinking, or, at least, \u201cdiscoveries\u201d (Fried, 2020; Bhattacharya and Packalen, 2020). Slicing papers, multi-author contributions, revisions of reviews, meta-analyses, and empirically untested modeling approaches solely based on pure mathematics (Vora, 2018; Tolsgaard et al., 2019; Lee-Yaw et al., 2021) are on the spot, dominating the issues in elite journals (Ketcham and Crawford, 2007; Fontelo and Liu, 2018). So, the point is\u2014why are we not developing new ideas in science as fast as we are publishing papers? Particularly, why are unconventional theories lacking despite the enormous scientific production? Let us go to the current model of peer review and see a common situation of a flawed process (Smith, 2006) and how it affects the development of new ideas or theories\u2014for example\u2014a review or a paper with meta-analysis that compiles information from previous papers is a \u201cshining diamond\u201d for journals if the topic is sound and timely.

    "title": "Socioeconomic status determines COVID-19 incidence and related mortality in Santiago, Chile",
    "abstract": "Urban socioeconomics and mortality Santiago, Chile, is a highly segregated city with distinct zones of affluence and deprivation. This setting offers a window on how social factors propel the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in an economically vulnerable society with high levels of income inequality. Mena et al. analyzed incidence and mortality attributed to SARS-CoV-2 to understand spatial variations in disease burden. Infection fatality rates were higher in lower-income municipalities because of comorbidities and lack of access to health care. Disparities between municipalities in the quality of their health care delivery system became apparent in testing delays and capacity. These indicators explain a large part of the variation in COVID-19 underreporting and deaths and show that these inequalities disproportionately affected younger people. Science, abg5298, this issue p. eabg5298 The consequences of health care inequalities have been exacerbated during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a large, economically vulnerable city. INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 crisis has exposed major inequalities between communities. Understanding the societal risk factors that make some groups particularly vulnerable is essential to ensure more effective interventions for this and future pandemics. Here, we focus on socioeconomic status as a risk factor. Although it is broadly understood that social and economic inequality has a negative impact on health outcomes, the mechanisms by which socioeconomic status affects disease outcomes remain unclear. These mechanisms can be mediated by a range of systemic structural factors, such as access to health care and economic safety nets. We address this gap by providing an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. RATIONALE Combining publicly available data sources, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of case incidence and mortality during the first wave of the pandemic. We correlated COVID-19 outcomes with behavioral and health care system factors while studying their interaction with age and socioeconomic status. To overcome the intrinsic biases of incomplete case count data, we used detailed mortality data. We developed a parsimonious Gaussian process model to study excess deaths and their uncertainty and reconstructed true incidence from the time series of deaths with a new regularized maximum likelihood deconvolution method. To estimate infection fatality rates by age and socioeconomic status, we implemented a hierarchical Bayesian model that adjusts for reporting biases while accounting for incompleteness in case information. RESULTS We find robust associations between COVID-19 outcomes and socioeconomic status, based on health and behavioral indicators. Specifically, we show in lower\u2013socioeconomic status municipalities that testing was almost absent early in the pandemic and that human mobility was not reduced by lockdowns as much as it was in more affluent locations. Test positivity and testing delays were much higher in these locations, indicating an impaired capacity of the health care system to contain the spread of the epidemic. We also find that 73% more deaths than in a normal year were observed between May and July 2020, and municipalities at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum were hit the hardest, both in relation to COVID-19\u2013attributed deaths and excess deaths. Finally, the socioeconomic gradient of the infection fatality rate appeared particularly steep for younger age groups, reflecting worse baseline health status and limited access to health care in municipalities with low socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION Together, these findings highlight the substantial consequences of socioeconomic and health care disparities in a highly segregated city and provide practical methodological approaches useful for characterizing the COVID-19 burden and mortality in other urban centers based on public data, even if reports are incomplete and biased. Effect of socioeconomic inequalities on COVID-19 outcomes. The map on the left shows the municipalities that were included in this study, colored by their socioeconomic status score. For the comparison between COVID-19 deaths and excess deaths (top right), COVID-19\u2013confirmed deaths are shown in light green and COVID-19\u2013attributed deaths in dark green. Excess deaths, shown in gray, correspond to the difference between observed and predicted deaths. Predicted deaths were estimated using a Gaussian process model. The shading indicates 95% credible intervals for the excess deaths. The infection fatality rates (bottom right) were inferred by implementing a hierarchical Bayesian model, with vertical lines representing credible intervals by age and socioeconomic status. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected cities particularly hard. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. Our analyses show a strong association between socioeconomic status and both COVID-19 outcomes and public health capacity. People living in municipalities with low socioeconomic status did not reduce their mobility during lockdowns as much as those in more affluent municipalities. Testing volumes may have been insufficient early in the pandemic in those places, and both test positivity rates and testing delays were much higher. We find a strong association between socioeconomic status and mortality, measured by either COVID-19\u2013attributed deaths or excess deaths. Finally, we show that infection fatality rates in young people are higher in low-income municipalities. Together, these results highlight the critical consequences of socioeconomic inequalities on health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A promising candidate for sensitive imaging of breast cancer is 3D Ultrasound Computer Tomography (3D USCT). So far its clinical applicability for diagnosis has been limited by the duration of the demanding image reconstruction. In this paper we investigate how signal processing and image reconstruction can be accelerated for diagnosis by using heterogeneous hardware. Additionally, the time and costs for real-time system for a future diagnosis and therapy device is estimated. Reusing the device's built-in FPGA-based data acquisition system (DAQ) through reconfiguration results in a speed-up by a factor of 7 for signal processing and by a factor of 2 for image reconstruction. Applying cutting-edge single FPGAs and GPUs, speed-ups by a factor of 10 (FPGA) and 6 (GPU) for signal processing and 15 (FPGA) and 37 (GPU) for image reconstruction were achieved compared to a recent quad-core Intel Core-i7 CPU. Using quad-core CPUs and a cluster of eight GPUs allowed us for the first time to calculate volumes in less than 30 min with an overall speed-up by a factor of 47, enabling a first clinical study. Based on these results we extrapolated that real-time reconstruction for a therapeutic 3D USCT will be possible in the year 2020 if the trend in density follows the ITRS roadmap.",

    "abstract": "Surface radio refractive gradient and k-factor are very imperative in observing propagation conditions, designing and planning of microwave communication links in the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer. The measurement of weather variables (air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity and wind speed) were conducted in this study at the School of Science, Emmanuel Alayande College of Education, Oyo (7.83\u00b0N, 3.95\u00b0E), Oyo State, Nigeria. The research was carried out for a period of one year (January to December, 2020) using self-designed cost effective portable weather monitoring systems. The systems were sited from the ground to a height of 200 m on a 220 m Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) UHF channel 37 tower at Oke-Apitipiti in Oyo Town of Oyo State. The calculated daily and monthly averages data are employed to investigate the vertical surface radio refractivity and its refractivity gradient. The highest value of -1.093E+26 N-units/km was recorded in January, while the month of July experienced the least of about -9.305E+19 N-units/km. The months of January\u2013July verified sub-refractive conditions with propagation conditions having varying degree of occurrence. On the other hand, super-refraction and ducting were recorded mostly between August\u2013December from the study. The results also find applicability in radio engineering for refining VHF/UHF terrestrial links based on clear-air considerations which will support operational planning of terrestrial radio networks in Oyo, South Western Nigeria \nKeywords: Microwave; k-factor; refractivity gradient; sub-refractive; super-refraction",

In this context, the purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing indoor air quality and to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the studies on the subject. The method of bibliometric analysis was used to examine academic publications on indoor air quality published between 1975 and 2020. A total of 2398 academic studies from the Web of Science database were examined. According to the findings of the analyses, academic research has primarily been conducted in the fields of construction technology and environmental sciences, public environmental occupational health, and environmental engineering. Since 2010, there has been a significant increase in the number of publications. The year with the most publications was 2017, and especially after 2010, publications have been cited more and more. One-fourth of the publications were produced solely in the United States. Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Denmark Technical University had the most publications. It has been determined that ventilation and air flow rate are the most heavily researched factors affecting indoor air quality. On the other hand, a substantial amount of research has been conducted to investigate the effects of pollutants. Furthermore, publications on temperature, humidity, bacteria, and thermal comfort were discovered. There have been studies on indoor air quality in residential buildings, houses, schools, and hospitals.",

    "title": "Identifying Needs of Research Faculty Based on the Characteristics of Their Publications and Their Cited References at a Research Institution",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper provides information on the characteristics of the research output from the chemistry and biochemistry faculty publications at the University of Arkansas over a ten-year period (2011\u20132020). The faculty publications were used to identify (a) a core set of journals and other resources they are publishing in and citing over this period; (b) the characteristics of the journals in which they publish and cite (i.e., scatter of publications, Bradford distribution, major publishers, ranking and subject categories based on the Journal citation Reports (JCR); (3) the degree of openness of their publications; their citation advantage, if any, using both the Web of Science and SciFinder; and (4) the age of resources that are referenced. Based on the findings, the authors were able to gain a very good overview of the characteristics of the research publications and were able to identify how well the library is catering to those needs. We were able to demonstrate based on information obtained from both Web of Science and SciFinder, that the non-OA papers from this department had higher citations.",

    "title": "Welcome to volume 6 of Future Science OA",
    "abstract": "Welcome to the first issue of volume 6 from Future Science OA! In this Foreword, I will take a look over both the highlights of 2019 in Future Science OA and what we can expect from 2020. The year of 2019 was a fantastic year for the journal, with it becoming indexed on Scopus and seeing an average of 38,000 full-text readers a month across our approximately 450 publications. Those readers come to access great research and we published some really interesting articles in 2019 from a wide range of topics. My personal highlight was an article entitled \u201c\u2018Academic periodization\u2019: using approaches from elite sport to benefit early career academics\u201d by J Gonzalez and K Deighton [1]. This article was part of a special issue focused on early career researchers and discussed how periodization \u2013 a method used by athletes to maximize performance while minimizing risk of overtraining and injury \u2013 can be applied to early career researchers. This article formed part of an excellent issue guest edited by L Heaney (Loughborough University, UK), one of our panel of Young Ambassadors, and is well worth a read for any researcher looking to advance their career without burning out [2]. Another fantastic article was a review entitled \u201cBromodomain and extra-terminal motif inhibitors: a review of preclinical and clinical advances in cancer therapy\u201d by Alqahtani et al [3]. This is our second most-read article from 2019 (after [1]) and makes for a fascinating read. These articles are by no means my only highlights from this year \u2013 it is hard to pick from the over 70 new research, review and opinion pieces we have published this year, as well as the novel methodologies and data notes! We also supported the third iteration of the Future Science Early Career Research Award, which has been renamed the Future Science Future Star Award. This year, M Pizarro-Guajardo (Universidad Andr\u00e9s Bello, Santiago, Chile) won, following stiff competition from 28 candidates [4]. She will be guest editing a special issue of Future Science OA, which will be published in 2020. In the meantime, you can find out more about her fantastic career so far in our winner\u2019s podcast [5]. This year also saw the publication of a research article from last year\u2019s winner, V Mucci [6]. Mucci\u2019s study examined the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy for patients with Mal de Debarquement syndrome. We are delighted with how winning the award has increased visibility of research into this rare neurological disorder.",

    "abstract": "Objective. The ability of peer review to improve the scientific endeavour, e.g., conduct, reporting, and validity of study findings, is increasingly being questioned (Tennant & Ross-Hellauer, 2020) and calls have been made to showcase changes that occurred to each study due to peer review (Limbu, 2020). Until such transparency is achieved, our objective is to identify and collect studies that analysed differences between preprints or submitted manuscripts and peer reviewed journal articles. \nDesign. We identified studies based on our knowledge of the field and by checking all research at peer review conferences (presented as podium presentations or posters). We also checked references of identified studies. For all included studies we then extracted the year of publication, sampling method, conflicts of interest, funding, data and protocol sharing, number of analysed version-pairs, sample size calculation, scholarly discipline, method used to compare versions, variables (i.e., manuscript sections) analysed for changes, and metric with which the changes were quantified or qualitatively classified. Future steps will include a search of bibliographic databases (and preprint servers) and launching of an online form that will allow anyone to submit missed studies for inclusion in the review. Current findings are only descriptive, but meta-analyses are planned. \nResults. Of 25 studies published from 1990 till the end of 2021, 16 analysed changes between submitted and published papers and 9 between preprints and published papers. Changes were most often analysed by filling out questionnaires or scoring each of the two manuscript versions separately (n=11) or by comparing them visually (n=6). Median number of analysed version-pairs was 59 (IQR, 41- 122). Most studies analysed changes in health (n=18) or social sciences (n=4) manuscripts. Overall, they find a very high similarity between version-pairs, with largest changes occurring in introduction and discussion sections. \nConclusions. Current results indicate that submitted or pre-printed manuscript versions and their peer-reviewed journal version are very similar, with main (analysis) methods and main findings rarely changing. Quantification of these results is pending. Large differences between studies, type of changes, and methods with which they were measured indicate greater need for collaboration in the peer-review field and for core outcome measures for manuscript version changes.",

We focus on the perception of stress among the students who took a calculus basics course in the academic years 2020/21 and 2021/22. The data were collected using an anonymous online questionnaire and was analysed using a t-test of independent samples. The results show that there are not many differences between the two generations and between the males and females, but some differences are highlighted. We have noticed that the students are concerned with the well-being of their families and loved ones, while their financial well-being is not a bigger worry than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Observed differences in the minor feelings of discomfort such as stress, social isolation, etc., are expected. Still, it is also indicated that the students have become more resilient with the length of the situation and the predictions of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The experiment was laid out in Factorial randomized block design with three replications each consisting of two cultivation system i.e., hydroponics system and pot culture, each having 12 treatments with T0 (control). The two type (Pot Experiment + Hydroponic Experiment) of planting system, and their interaction have a significant effect on the growth and yield of the plants. According to the findings, plants cultivated in hydroponic system along T7 (with Grow, Micro & Bloom) at 24 hours interval of 42 days maximize yield while also performing best in growth, quality, and yield contributing attributes. The hydroponic system yielded 20.92 per cent and 16.91 per cent higher than soilless media and soil, respectively. The nutrient uptake was also recorded highest under this treatment leading to conclusion that nutrients are more readily available to the plants under hydroponic system as compared to soilless media or soil and gave the maximum net returns and maximum benefit: cost ratio.",

    "abstract": "The main problems that will be solved through this Classroom Action Research are: Are The \u201cAWAS (Activity Watch And See)\u201d Learning Model Can Increase Learning Motivation Geography In Class XI 1 IPS SMA NEGERI 1 GANTUNG for the 2020/2021 academic year. The \"AWAS (Activity Watch And See)\" learning model was chosen with the assumption that it is very relevant to environmental subject matter, with the aim of being able to motivate students to be active, innovative, creative, effective and fun, as well as easy to manufacture and use.The goal to be achieved is to increase student learning motivation in the subject of Geography. The research subjects were students of class XI IPS 1 at SMA Negeri 1 Gantung, totaling 21 students. Research data were collected through daily observations and tests. Sources of data obtained from teachers, peers and students. The action hypothesis is UseThe \"AWAS (Activity Watch And See)\" Learning Model Can Increase Motivation to Learn Geography in Class XI 1 Social Studies at SMA Negeri 1 Gantung for the 2020/2021 Academic Year. The results showed that the use of the \"AWAS\" learning model in subjects in Geography on basic environmental competencies could increase students' learning motivation in class XI IPS 1 SMA Negeri 1 Gantung. This is evident from the learning achievement test data also shows an increase, namely in the pre-cycle as many as 11 students (47.6%) achieved the KKM with an average of 75.76, in the first cycle students who achieved completion were 61, 9% or 13 students. with an average of 76.57 and in the second cycle of 85.7% or 18 students with an average of 79.90.So after the whole cycle is done, it can be concluded that the use of The \"AWAS (Activity Watch And See)\" Learning Model Can Increase Learning Motivation Geography In Class XI 1 Social Sciences at SMA Negeri 1\u00a0 for the 2020/2021 academic year. The obstacles faced in this AWAS learning are the lack of time allocation, the lack of mastery of using the Windows Movie Maker application (other applications). However, this obstacle can be anticipated by using a powerpoint that is already familiar to students",

    "title": "What is happening in Sweden?",
    "abstract": "Sweden has witnessed significant, fast, and sustainable evolution in the optometry profession over the past 3 decades. We recommend a visit to the webpage of Sancta Lucia Gilles for a fantastic compilation of the history of optometry in Sweden \u2014 https://www.sanctaluciagille.se/optikeryrkets-historia. In this editorial we share some exciting news about the optometry education and extended responsibilities for optometrists. After about 20 years of solid first-cycle bachelor education, Linnaeus University opened a new master program in optometry and vision sciences in 2021 (Linnaeus University, 2022). From September 2023 the bachelor education at Linnaeus University will be available from Campus Kalmar and Campus Gothenburg. Thatmeans an annual intake of about 75 first-cycle students and up to 25 second-cycle (masters) students per year. With an annual intake of 100 new students Linnaeus University will be a big player in optometry in theNordic countries. In parallel, the responsibilities of Swedish optometrists are expected to be extended by the Swedish authorities. We aim to shed some light on the impact of these developments on optometry education in Sweden and the rest of the Nordic countries. Recognising the evolving healthcare landscape and, probably, appreciating optometrists as a major asset for the chain of eye care, Socialstyrelsen (the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare) is planning to extend optometrists responsibilities. Socialstyrelsen is an agency under the Swedish Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Socialstyrelsen, 2019; 2020) and is responsible for ensuring the quality, accessibility, and equity of healthcare and social services. From January 2024 the main planned changes to the law that controls optometric practice are: (a) optometrists will be allowed to perform eye exams and prescribe refractive correction to children of any age (currently Swedish optometrists cannot prescribe to children under the age of 8 years), (b) the text \u201coptometrists cannot touch the eye\u201d will be removed from the law, and (c) the \u201ccontact lens license\u201d will cease to exist as a speciality, that is, all optometrists will be licensed to work with contact lenses. In addition, despite it not being mentioned in the law, the current consensus amongst all eye care professionals is that optometrists must be more selective when referring patients to hospital care. In many cases, optometrists can follow up their patients themselves instead of referring them to hospital. This seems particularly relevant for conditions such as non-exudative age-relatedmacular degeneration and glaucoma (Landgren & Peters, 2021). The law will also include some updates about the vision assessment for driving licenses, but that has less impact on the scope of practice.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that computational thinking, composed of the skills of abstraction, decomposition, algorithmization, debugging, and problem-solving, is the fundamental skill for scientific, technological, and economic development for the twenty-first century. However, this diagnosis that is unveiled in rich countries remains nebulous for poor countries. The problem is that education in computational thinking is fundamental for countries to insert themselves in the international arena in an advantageous way and thus achieve the welfare goals for the population of each country. The objective of this research was to make a bibliographic review that shows the state of the art in the teaching of computer programming and computational thinking in the 5 continents. In the review, the advances in the countries of Europe, North America, Oceania, and Asia were observed, whereas in Latin America and Africa, the advances are still basic in some countries and non-existent in others. This review is based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The main search terms were \u201cComputational thinking\u201d and \u201cTeaching computer programming.\u201d The search was performed in the ACM, Conference on Computational Thinking Education (Hong-Kong), Google Scholar, WOS, and SCOPUS databases, from October until December 2020, whose publication year was from 2016 onward. One of the main results found is that the teaching of computational thinking in England was implemented in schools in 2014; in Germany, it has been implemented since 2016 at a transversal level in universities; in South Korea, China, and Taiwan, it has been implemented since 2016. However, in Latin America and Africa governments, the subject is still not considered.",

    "abstract": "Mobile Application is the software that is used for portable devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. It is compatible with Android, iOS, Harmony OS, and Windows phones. People nowadays prefer to order food via existing applications or platforms. Especially during movement control orders (MCO) of the year 2020 in Malaysia as the epidemic spreads globally. In this paper, the functionality of Fruity Healthy as fruit ordering application that allows customers to purchase fruits with only one click will be discussed. Users can shop from an online store rather than going to the physical store. Moreover, to assist farmers to expand their market sales, a fruit ordering application will help to promote their fruits through an online platform. The objectives of this project are to help farmers increase their sales market, to develop a mobile application that is used for ordering fruit and compare the scalability of the new application with the existing applications. Android Studio is the software that has been chosen to propose the application and will be written in the Java programming language. At the end of this project, users able to utilize the application for ordering and promoting fruit. It makes it easier for farmers to earn their expected salary by using the internet as a secondary platform. Customers\u2019 information will be recorded in the database so that sellers can choose who to target and how to enhance sales in the future.",

    "abstract": "Purpose\nThis study aims to identify the most important factors affecting the usability of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and present these factors in the form of a comprehensive and practical framework and validate the framework.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIn this research, a mixed research method and sequential exploratory research design were used. In the qualitative section, the qualitative meta-synthesis method was utilized to extract usability factors from the research literature and formulate the framework of factors, and in the quantitative section, the survey method was employed to validate the framework. In the qualitative section, the research field included the research available in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, and the data collection tool included electronic and printed documents on the usability factors of LMSs. To validate the findings, in addition to citing research literature and theoretical foundations, the audit trail, consensual validity and expert peer review methods were used. Also, to analyze the data, the thematic analysis method and thematic network via MAXQDA 2020 software were used. In the quantitative section, the statistical population was students of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences at Allameh Tabatabai University in Iran, and the sample included undergraduate students of this faculty with a volume of 200 people. The tool for collecting information was a researcher-made questionnaire that was provided to students in the first half of the academic year 2022\u20132023. To validate the findings, content-related validity through Content Validity Ratio (CVR) and Content Validity Index (CVI) and construct validity through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Convergent Validity were examined. Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient and Composite Reliability (CR) were also used to check reliability. To analyze the data one-sample T-test via SPSS 27 software was used, and the PLS-SEM was utilized via SmartPLS 4 software to validate the framework proposed by the researcher.\n\nFindings\nThe findings from the qualitative part of this research include basic themes and organizing themes related to the global theme of usability. Based on the findings from the qualitative part, it can be concluded that the factors in terms of frequency in the research literature have the following ranks: interaction (first rank), ease of use and usefulness (second rank), learnability (third rank), navigation (fourth rank), satisfaction and enjoyment, visual design and accessibility (fifth rank), help and assessment and feedback (sixth rank) and content, errors correction and privacy and security (seventh rank). The findings of the quantitative part include the external fit indexes of the framework and the internal fit index of the framework; based on the obtained values, it can be concluded that the framework of LMS usability factors has a good fit.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis research is the first comprehensive study of all theories on the usability of LMSs, in which a framework is proposed that combines the important factors mentioned in the relevant theories and models for the first time. Additionally, practical and applicable suggestions are provided in this study to enhance each of the usability factors of LMS.\n\nOriginality/value\nTo the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this research presents a framework for the first time in which all important factors of usability theories and models are combined and prioritizes these factors based on their importance in relevant research. It also provides practical recommendations for enhancing these factors in LMSs for system developers and instructional designers.\n",

    "abstract": "As we know 2020 is a year which created lots of issues with every type of the business. Even it affects the agricultural eco system. Due to COVID-19 there is very less man power is available and farmers who are doing forming in larger way, they need lots of man power to monitor & maintain their farmers. Due to lack in man power its very difficult for the formers to monitor their farms from remotely, so there is need of system which is able to provide smart agricultural features like temperature & humidity monitoring remotely apart from that farmer have the power to monitor the quality of their leaves. So, in this paper we present an IoT enabled system which is able to track the temperature & Humidity from the remotely apart from that it is also able to capture the image of the leaf and send to server where in server using Computer vision & machine learning system, we will track the leaf quality. In this paper we proposed a hardware unit which is basically using ESP32 Cam and DHT11. Here ESP-32 work as smart CAM which is able to track the image of the leaf and send those real time image to the server. Here we are using think speak to store the accuracy level parameters of each leaf record. Similar we will store temperature & humidity real time data on the think speak server. Think speak server is powered by math work.",

    "title": "Postharvest horticulture: a multidisciplinary science field that enables global fresh produce trade",
    "abstract": "New Zealand is located in a unique position, while also being unique for developed countries in that a major part of the economic success relies on the production and sale of food to the world. The first shipment of frozen meat from New Zealand to the United Kingdom in 1881 by the ship Dunedin signalled the importance of being at the cutting edge of technology in order to develop and operate the supply chains of perishable products. As such, postharvest scientists within New Zealand have and continue to make important contributions to support horticultural industries, and the unique additional challenges in the supply chain that occurs when you have a live respiring product with inherent biological variability. With rapidly expanding horticultural production within New Zealand and societal drivers to reduce meat and animal product consumption, the need for postharvest horticulture skills and technologies to ensure that products meet consumer\u2019s needs, remains as important as ever. Postharvest science in itself represents a wide scientific skill base allowing the solutions to problems and the generation of knowledge to occur from multiple disciplines. Work presented in postharvest problems ranges from physiology (e.g. gene signalling, metabolomics and cell wall degredation) to technology (e.g. appropriate maturity definition, atmospheric manipulation, heat treatments, etc.) to engineering (e.g. sorting and packaging technologies, cool chain design and mathematical prediction systems). Each component of the postharvest science field plays a role in identifying the causes of problems, narrowing in on the mechanisms and designing solutions to solve the problem as best as possible. The Covid19 pandemic has had many impacts on society. One very noticeable effect on scientists was the inability to travel and meet our colleagues with the same intellectual passions as our own. In particular 2020 was to be a flagship year for postharvest science in New Zealand, with the return of the ISHS Postharvest Symposium, the most important conference of the field, to be held in Rotorua, New Zealand in November 2020. Unfortunately, that was not to be, with the conference delayed until 2024 (https://www.scienceevents.co. nz/postharvest2024). The biannual Plant Science Central held at Massey University in Palmerston North in 2021 was a notable relief in the midst of the pandemic. New Zealand\u2019s tight border controls and elimination policy had led to no cases in the community for a prolonged period and created a unique opportunity for New Zealand-based Plant Scientists to be able to come together, share their work and enjoy the science and social discussions. This special issue was spun out of this conference and the fact that opportunities had been lost over the pandemic, especially for our early career colleagues, where the formation of relationships with other experts of their chosen field is an important part of their career development. This special issue comprises of a group of works, some of which were presented at Plant Science Central 2021, while others were submitted independently of the conference. Twelve (12) high-quality papers are a result of the call for the formation of a postharvest special issue.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The objective of this evaluation is to show how the STEP.UP program promoted the professional development at Michigan Medicine by providing clinical and translational research staff an experienced research staff mentor in a structured 9-month program. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Participant and mentor data was collected from application forms, online surveys, and interviews with both participating mentors and mentees. Validated assessments of mentoring competencies were administered. Participants were tracked over a period of four years with regular reviews of institutional records. Mentor and mentor data was also collected at the point of application each year and the application forms were aligned with NIH definitions for underrepresented populations in science in 2020. As part of a process of continuous programmatic improvement, a STEP.UP Advisory Board consisting of senior research staff and past mentors was involved in the identification, operationalization and evaluation of programmatic outcomes and is involve din the ongoing governance of this mentoring program. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Four cohorts of mentees and mentors have participated in this program since its inception. Mentees gained the greatest abilities in, Active listening, Establishing a relationship based on trust, Considering how personal and professional differences may impact expectations, and Working effectively with mentors/mentees whose personal background is different. Mentees reported the program contributed to their Career planning, Professional advancement, networking, personal growth, professional networks, and communication skills. Mentors reported learning about new professional techniques and areas of expertise. As of 2021, 75% the first cohort changed their job-classification since participating as did 25% of the second cohort and 100% of mentees have maintained research careers. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The creation of this program in 2019 marked the beginning of a novel professional development opportunity at Michigan Medicine. The evaluation results show how STEP.UP contributes to advancing clinical and translational study teams and how it can inform and the identification of best practices in clinical and translational workforce development.",

    "title": "The Pomeps Virtual Research Workshop",
    "abstract": "DOI:10.1017/S1049096522000270 In June 2020, the Project on Middle East Political Science (POMEPS) launched a virtual research workshop for junior scholars to fill the void left by the cancelation of so many conferences and workshops due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 2021\u20132022 academic year, we expanded the virtual workshop dramatically to include 18 workshops dedicated to book manuscripts or journal-article manuscripts. Because of the format\u2019s flexibility, efficiency, and advantages for diversity and inclusion, we plan to continue it even when travel becomes possible again. There are costs and risks, however, that require attention. Overall, the move to virtual research workshops has been a resounding success. Since its launch, POMEPS has conducted 24 workshops, including 82 junior-scholar authors and 58 seniorscholar discussants. Each two-hour article workshop typically features three papers, each with one assigned discussant. The authors are asked to read the other two papers, whereas discussants may but are not required to do so. As the convener and moderator, I read all of the papers and provide a second set of comments to supplement the assigned discussant. Book workshops, which are more intense, typically last 90 minutes for one paper or three hours for two papers on related themes. Each book manuscript has two dedicated readers, in addition to myself and typically one other member of the selection committee. We conducted 11 virtual bookworkshops for the 2021\u20132022 academic year. The buy-in from theMiddle East political science (and broader Middle East studies) community has been phenomenal. Although we cannot offer honoraria, almost all invited discussants usually agree to participate. If they are unavailable, they often offer suggestions for alternatives\u2014which is useful when the topics of the papers or books are outside of the organizers\u2019 areas of expertise. A Zoom meeting will never be as much fun as an in-person seminar, but the relatively small size of the group keeps everyone engaged and allows for personal interactions. Authors do not present their manuscript, assuming that it has been read in advance, which maintains a high level of engagement because there are few long spans of only listening. The virtual format allows us to more fully include scholars based in theMiddle East and Europe, for whom it otherwisemight be prohibitively expensive and pose complicated visa issues. We can offer invitations without regard to physical distance or national location. As a result, scholars from the Middle East and Europe who otherwise might have been excluded for logistical or cost reasons can participate at a high level: 40 of the 82 article authors and eight of the 11 book authors participated from outside of the United States. This also allows us to forego extensive advance planning, travel arrangements and logistics, andmultiday disruptions. The selection process actively seeks applicants from outside of the usual elite institutional networks, on the assumption that junior scholars from top schools already have support from their institution and are networked into the scholarly community. POMEPS has definite plans to continue these workshops even after the world heals; however, there are disadvantages to the format. In general, we have not heard the common complaint that online sessions are alienating, non-interactive, or unproductive. The small size and engagement-oriented organization has resulted in dynamic and productive sessions. Zoom burnout is real, however. We have found that a session lasting more than a few hours is difficult to sustain, even for the most dedicated of us. Time zones also have been an issue\u2014we sometimes struggle to find workable times for participants who might be calling in from the West Coast of the United States and from Doha, Qatar. Moreover, there is no substitute for the informal time after inperson workshops sharing cocktails or dinner or an evening walk through a new city. We are concerned that the ease of virtual workshops will lead to a two-tier system in which non-U.S. based scholars benefit from feedback and professional development but remain excluded from the more informal social benefits of inperson events. A more significant concern about the potential for a selfdestructive dynamic is the tendency to overschedule because it is so easy and inexpensive to do so. The sheer volume of workshops enabled by the virtual format can be overwhelming, not only for the organizer who reads and comments on all of the papers almost weekly but also for the larger community. If we exhaust the pool of plausible readers and return multiple times to the same senior scholars, at some point, their enthusiasm for being a discussant inevitably will wane. Furthermore, it is possible that funders will observe the success of online models and become unwilling to fund the more expensive and unwieldy in-person events. That would be very disappointing because many new ideas and enduring partnerships are developed in those informal spaces of inperson conferences and workshops.\u25aa",

    "abstract": "2021 was declared the Year of Science and Technology by the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 812 of December 25, 2020. The main purpose of its holding is the development of science and technology in our country. Support and improvement of the effectiveness of scientific research are directly related to libraries \u2014 scientific-research institutions. Within the framework of the Year of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation resumed the All-Russian competition of scientific works in the area of library science, bibliography and book studies, which took place in 1978\u20142014. The competition has established itself as one of the most effective methods of evaluating and encouraging the results of research work in librarianship. In 2021, it was organized and conducted by the National Library of Russia and the Russian State Library. On November 18, 2021, within the framework of the Annual Meeting of the Heads of federal and central regional libraries of Russia, the solemn awarding of the winners took place.In 2021, the jury of the competition considered 105 works (42 \u2014 in library science, 17 \u2014 in bibliography, 22 \u2014 in book studies, 24 works related to other categories). 150 authors from 41 subjects of the Russian Federation presented their works.The article presents in tabular form the winners in six nominations (\u201cBest scientific work in the field of library science\u201d; \u201cBest scientific work in the field of bibliography science\u201d; \u201cBest scientific work in the field of book studies\u201d; \u201cBest scientific multimedia project\u201d; \u201cBest scientific work of regional libraries\u201d; \u201cBest scientific work of young specialist under the age of 35\u201d). The article also presents the winners in additional nominations established by national libraries.The competition has shown significant scientific-research potential; and the materials presented are of great importance not only for the development of libraries and the branch as a whole, but also largely serve to solve social and humanitarian problems set out in the \u201cFundamentals of State Cultural Policy\u201d, established by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 808 of December 24, 2014.It is advisable to consider the holding of the All-Russian competition of scientific papers in library science, bibliography and book studies in conjunction with other major scientific events in the library field that took place in 2021: publication of the collective monograph \u201cScientific research in libraries: topics, organization, presentation of results\u201d and the International scientific and Practical Conference \u201cLibrary science in the XXI century: content, organization, digitalization and scientometrics\u201d. These events contributed to the support and development of science in librarianship in the framework of implementation of the \u201cStrategy for the Development of Librarianship in the Russian Federation for the period up to 2030\u201d.",

    "abstract": "The contributions in this spotlight of \u201cFrom the Sections\u201d were published in the Legislative Studies Section (LSS) newsletter, The Legislative Scholar in the Fall of 2020. This spotlight explores research on racial and ethnic politics (REP) as it applies to legislative studies. Few REP scholars in political science identify as legislative scholars or maintain membership in the LSS, yet so many do important and timely research on legislative politics. Therefore, our goal is to highlight cutting-edge research at the intersection of REP and legislative politics\u2014illuminating and reinforcing connections between the two areas of scholarship. It is a critical time to examine the intersection of REP and legislative studies. By the year 2040, the United States is expected to become a majority-nonwhite country; today, a few states already are. This suggests that moving forward, more nonwhites will serve in legislatures across the country and in multiple levels of government (i.e., federal, state, and national). Moreover, this increased diversity should influence the way in which white legislators behave, given that the composition of a legislator\u2019s district has been shown to affect legislative behavior. Thus, the study of race and ethnicity in legislative studies is critical for understanding the current and future state of representation in America\u2019s democracy. This spotlight showcases a range of scholarship that directly engages questions that are relevant to both minority representation and legislative studies. In reviewing this research, two observations are clear: (1) there already is copious research being conducted at the nexus of legislative studies andREP; and (2) these scholars\u2019 creativity, insights, and cutting-edge approaches are the foundation for an exciting stream of future work in this area. It is important to draw explicit attention to work that spans these two fields. Even though this research exists, many scholars tackling questions at the confluence of these fields tend primarily to identify with and speak to only one of the two fields. Yet, the LSS would be much stronger, have a wider reach, and be of greater relevance if more scholars working at the nexus of legislative studies and REP identified with the section.",

    "title": "Influence of soil and relief on productivity of clover-timothy herbage",
    "abstract": "Relevance. The article is devoted to the topical problem of studying the influence of soil conditions and the relief of an agricultural landscape on the yield of clover-timothy herbage on drained soils, knowledge of which makes it possible to optimize the production process of crops in the mode of adaptive landscape farming.Methods and results. The studies were carried out in 1998\u20132020 at the test site of the All-Russian Research Institute of Reclaimed Lands (VNIIMZ) \u2013 a branch of the Federal Research Centre Soil Science Institute named after V.V. Dokuchaev (Tver region), located within the end-moraine hill. The purpose of the research is to study the influence of soil conditions and the relief of the agricultural landscape on the yield of clover-timothy herbage of 1 year of use. Grass productivity monitoring was carried out on a transect \u2013 a field crossing the main microlandscape positions (relief elements) and elementary soil combinations of the agrolandscape. Crop productivity and other parameters of the vegetation and soil cover on the transect were taken into account on 30 systematically located plots, within which there are 4 replicates, 23 m2 in area, spaced 10 m from each other.Results of studies on productivity were processed by correlation and multivariate analysis of variance. Studies have shown that the relief and soil features of the agricultural landscape have almost the same effect on the crop yield. Each of these factors, on average, determined 18\u201316% of the spatial variability in productivity. About 2/3 of the variability in the yield of herbs depends on factors that are difficult to take into account. It was found that the degree of influence of the relief and soils on the yield of grasses is not constant over time and ranges from 2 to 33%. In the time series of observations, periods of synchronous and asynchronous fluctuations in the degrees of influence of soil and relief on the yield were distinguished. Synchronization of temporal fluctuations in the degrees of impact on the productivity of grasses of different elements of the landscape occurs with a decrease in the amount of precipitation and active temperatures. On the basis of the revealed patterns, it is possible to develop measures to adapt technologies for growing perennial grasses to the natural conditions of farms in the mode of adaptive landscape fodder production.",

    "title": "EXAMINATION OF PARENTS' FAMILY NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ATTITUDES IN TERMS OF VARIOUS DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES (ELAZI\u011e EXAMPLE)",
    "abstract": "Individuals who do not have balanced nutrition during childhood encounter the problem of obesity. The most important environmental risk factors in the emergence of obesity are: changing dietary habits, increased screen time spent with technological devices such as computers, tablets, phones, and televisions, adopting a sedentary lifestyle as a result, and a decrease in physical activity. In addition, factors such as increased academic stress on children, socio-economic level, and residing in major cities are also risk factors. In line with this information, the purpose of our research is to examine the relationship between parents' family nutrition and physical activity attitudes and the eating behaviors of high school students. First, the universe was determined in our study, followed by the use of the general survey model from quantitative research methods. Parents of 375 high school students studying in the 2022-2023 academic year participated in the research. The relationships between the variables in our research were analyzed statistically. The \"Family Nutrition and Physical Activity Screening Scale\" (\u00d6zdemir, 2020) was used to collect data. Our application form consists of two sections. The first section contains the demographic information form containing the data to be collected from the participants. The second section contains the scale form to be used in the research. The scale consists of five sub-dimensions: physical activity, parental behaviors, unhealthy eating habits, healthy food intake, and sedentary behaviors, restriction/reward sub-dimensions. SPSS 21 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) was used in the study. First, the analysis of descriptive statistical data of the participant group was performed. Then, the internal consistency coefficient was calculated. After that, t-tests and ANOVA tests were conducted to analyze the differentiation of scale results. Under the Post-Hoc heading, the Tukey test was performed for scale scores showing homogeneous distribution, and the direction of differentiation was determined. In the research, when the average values of the groups were examined, it was observed that the family nutrition and physical activity attitudes of males were higher than those of females. There was no significant differentiation for variables such as age, class, monthly income status, school type, success status, and parental education status. When the variable data on breakfast habits were examined, it was found that the participants who answered \"I have breakfast at home\" significantly differed from those who answered \"I have breakfast at school\" and \"I do not have breakfast.\"",

    "title": "Associations of physical activity, alcohol and nicotine consumption with diet types in secondary and tertiary education students: Results of two Austria nation-wide studies",
    "abstract": "Introduction & Purpose\nBased on consensus on the tremendous health benefits through physical activity (PA) & exercise at all ages, it is a sound recommendation for health promotion, maintaining good health and the prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) incl. risk factors. However, since health is a complex state that has to be earned over a lifetime, one single measure to promote sustainably good health seems insufficient, particularly in childhood, adolescence and emerging adulthood since inherited health-related behaviours, habits and lifestyles track over time resulting in (good or worse) the adult state of health. Both studies aimed to investigate health-related behaviours of Austrian secondary pupils and tertiary University/college students, with a focus on PA & exercise (days per week) linked to different diet types (mixed, vegetarian, vegan).\nMethods\nFrom science 2 school (Wirnitzer, n.d.b) and From science 2 highschool & university (Wirnitzer, n.d.a) were designed as interdisciplinary cross-sectional studies, with data collection Austria nation-wide (pupils: academic year 2019/2020; students: summer semester 2021). Participation in these standardized online questionnaires was anonymous and voluntary; based on self-report, data on sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle characteristics (PA & exercise, diet, alcohol and nicotine) were collected. Both studies were approved by the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research and all 9 Austrian Federal Education Authorities.\nResults\nIn total, 8,799 pupils (63% girls) and 6,148 students (65.3% females) provided complete data sets. Generally, 82.4% of pupils (15.0 \u00b1 2.3 years; 2.9 \u00b1 2.0 days/week) and 79.3% of students (24.8 \u00b1 6.2; 3.6 \u00b1 1.5 days/week) reported PA & exercise as leisure time activity. Compared to non-actives, they showed significantly higher daily intakes of fruit and fluids and less smoking (p < 0.05). A mixed diet was reported by the majority of pupils and students (84.3% at age 15.2 \u00b1 2.2 years and 71.2% at age 25.3 \u00b1 6.9 years) versus vegetarian (8.5% and 22.8%) and vegan diets (7.2% and 6.0%), respectively. In both populations, the vegan diet (3.2 for pupils; 3.9 for students; p < 0.01) was associated with more days/week of PA & exercise compared to vegetarian (2.9 for pupils; 3.4 for students) and mixed diets (2.8 for pupils; 2.9 for students), with a significant increase in leisure sports participation across diet types: up to 86.4% in pupils (p = 0.03) and 92.9% in students (p < 0.01) for the vegan diet. More vegan pupils (74.7%; p = 0.001) and students (32.5%; p < 0.01) reported not drinking alcohol compared to non-vegan pupils (range: 51.2-53.7%) and students (range: 26.7-30.7%), while there was no difference in smoking habits across dietary subgroups.\nDiscussion\nBoth studies were the first to examine the dual approach to sustainable health based on the prevalences of PA & exercise linked to different diet types. Key results are: (1) active vs. inactive pupils and students show lifestyle behaviours more beneficial to health, and (2) vegan vs. non-vegan youth are more active and report healthier behavioural choices. A strength of both studies is that the findings are based on large samples, especially the school study was conducted on a sample size nicely in line with the Austrian WHO HBSC study. Given the detrimental health effects of insufficient PA and poor dietary choices, attention should be focused on policies and educational curricula to improve healthy lifestyle choices, at best through a dual approach to health by permanently combining the personally modifiable and most natural lifestyle factors: (1) regular PA & exercise with (2) a healthy diet, in order to shape better public health by improved individual youth health. Although there is consensus on the tremendous health benefits through PA & exercise as a single measure, lifelong health seems impossible to be achieved by a 1-dimensional approach in the long-term.\nConclusion\nThe present research shows an interplay between PA patterns and dietary habits, not only influencing each other but also affecting other health-related behaviors. In this study, especially adopting a vegan diet is linked with healthier lifestyle behaviour, highlighting the importance of healthy dietary choices for overall health and well-being. Therefore, and since there is huge potential left untapped (Figure 1), the promising dual approach to sustainable health is recommended as a minimum and starting point in secondary and tertiary educational settings.\nReferences\nWirnitzer, K.

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Federal grant funding to support infrastructure development of translational biomedical research centers is a form of public health intervention. Establishing rigorous methods for measuring center success and outcomes is essential to justify continued funding. Methods: Bibliometric data compiled from a 5-year funding cycle of neurodegeneration and translational neuroscience research center were analyzed using the package bibliometrix for open-source software R and the NIH-developed research tool iCite. Results: The research team and their collaborators (n = 485) produced 157 grant-citing publications from 2015\u20132020. The science was produced by small research teams clustered around three main communities of topics: Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, brain imaging, and neuropsychological testing in the elderly. Using the relative citation ratio, the publications produced by the research team were found to be influential when compared to other R01-funded publications. Conclusion: Recent developments in bibliometric analysis expand beyond traditional measurement capabilities to better understand the characteristics, outcomes, and influences of research teams. These findings can be used to inform researchers and institutions about research team composition, productivity, and success. Measures of research influence may be used to justify return on investment to funders.",

    "title": "Editorial for Weed Science, Volume 68",
    "abstract": "This is the first issue of 2020, the end of a decade or the beginning, depending on how one counts. Nonetheless, it is an appropriate time to reflect back on how the journal has changed over the past 10 years. The biggest change has been the switch from Allen Press to Cambridge University Press as our publisher in 2016. The editorial board has tried to keep up with publishing trends this past decade. Notable changes have included the move to a digital-only presence, the addition of more color to published articles, and the implementation of plant name notation reflecting the international nature of the journal. Weed Science continues to be one of the premier journals in the discipline and in the agronomic sciences. The editorial board and the staff strive to improve the efficiency of the publication process and improve the scope of the journal. Weed Science seeks to publish more reviews and symposium articles. For the 12 months preceding September 1, 2019, 221 manuscripts were submitted to Weed Science compared with 231 in the previous 12-month period. Of the manuscripts submitted, 37% were accepted compared with 39% the previous year. The time from submission to first decision was 38.1 days this past year compared with 38.5 days for the previous year. The time from submission to first decision has been reduced by 40% since 2010 (Figure 1). To illustrate how the 38.1 days of the review process break out, I have included a flow diagram showing the time for each step in the editorial process (Figure 2). We continually strive to improve turnaround time during reviews as well as after manuscript acceptance. The impact factor forWeed Science was 2.00 in 2019, down slightly from the 2.004 mark this past year. The 5-year impact factor also declined from 2.351 to 2.301. Over the past 10 years, the single-year and 5-year impact factors have been positive (Figure 3). It has been interesting to see how submissions have changed over the past 10 years (Figure 4). In 2010, 42% of submissions came from the United States and 53% were from North America. This past year, submissions from the United States and China were almost at parity (32% vs. 31%). Two-thirds of submissions to Weed Science are from international researchers. For the year preceding September 1, 2019, the journal depended on 267 unique reviewers. Each year, approximately 800 to 900 reviewers are invited to review manuscripts for Weed Science. Figure 5 shows values for the percentages who accept, decline, or are uninvited (no response within 4 days). The excellent reputation of the journal would not be possible without the cutting-edge research submitted by authors and the diligent work of the editorial board and the hundreds of referred reviews that are submitted annually. I wish to thank the members of the editorial board and reviewers for their efforts this past year.",

    "title": "Experience of Teaching a Course on Software Engineering Principles Without a Project",
    "abstract": "This paper summarizes an experience in designing and delivering a course \"Software Development Essentials\", a second year computer science course designed to teach software engineering skills without a project component. This paper describes the motivation, design, and implementation of the course. This course was offered as a pilot course that enrolled approximately 65 students at the University of Virginia. The need for the course emerged as we found many later project-centric courses assumed students already had knowledge and skills related to build configuration, database usage, design, version control, and incremental development, despite none of them materials being covered in our intro programming sequence. Further, in the project-centric software engineering course (typically a third-year course), students often were expected to start on a project before concepts such as design principles, design patterns, and incremental development were covered. Thus, students were often learning these principles and techniques after they had already been working on a project for weeks, and often too late to implement these into the project naturally. This course is not intended to replace a software engineering course. Rather, this course is intended to prepare students for future project courses, including a software engineering course. In this paper, we describe our experience designing and delivering this course in the Spring semester 2020. We review both student and faculty feedback of the course, and what changes may be made when this course is made available in the future to a large population of students.",

    "abstract": "We present an experience report on moving face-to-face classes in a large CS1 course to an online format, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The course is based on the flipped classroom approach and team-based learning. Students prepare for classes by reading specific chapters of the textbook and/or by watching pre-recorded videos. The classes are synchronous, in which students take quizzes and work on programming assignments in teams, with the guidance of tutors. To evaluate the implementation, we compared the results from surveys and exams between 2019 and 2020. The results show that students were at least as satisfied with the online classes in 2020 in comparison with face-to-face classes from the previous year, and generally satisfied with the organization of the course and the learning experience. Moreover, we found no discernible change in the grades on the midterm exams and the final exam between the two years. In the future, we might allow the students to choose the class format that best fits their individual needs. \u00a9 Hrafn Loftsson and \u00c1sr\u00fan Matth\u00edasd\u00f3ttir;licensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0 Second International Computer Programming Education Conference (ICPEC 2021).",

    "abstract": "Research relevance: in 2020 year, due to COVID-19 conditions, educational institutions of all levels began to be forced to organize the educational process using e-learning and distant learning technologies. This process was not easy for students nor for teachers. It was especially difficult to study natural sciences, for example, chemistry from a distance. Research materials and methods: e-learning is based on distant learning technologies, electronic libraries, scientific materials in electronic format, as well as on use of information and telecommunication networks and many programs for remote communication with students. Research results: organization of learning process with using e-learning and distant learning technologies has some advantages. Conclusions: in distant learning of chemical disciplines, the course consists mainly of same stages as in traditional education: activation of fundamental chemical concepts; explanation of topic, expected results and new material; reflection or generalization, student assessment and homework.",

The purpose of this research is to know the implementation of the Institution\u2019s E-Learning Platform and to know the strengths and weaknesses of the implementation of the Institution\u2019s E-Learning Platform of ITB AAS Indonesia. This research applies descriptive qualitative research. The result of the study shows that ITB AAS Indonesia began implementing e-learning to support face-to-face classrooms in the academic year 2020/2021. E-learning\u2019s platform was made based on Learning Management System (LMS) that can be accessed at the website https://elearning.itbaas.ac.id/ Based on the implementation of the e-learning, there are several menus found such as \u201cHome, Message, Teaching Schedule, Material, Task, My Comment, Lecturer\u2019s Filter, Student\u2019s Filter, Video Conference, and Logout\u201d. But, during the observation of the implementation of the e-learning platform, there are several strengths and weaknesses. In strengths are 1) Multi Users, 2) Online Application. 3) Several menus available. In the weaknesses, 1. This application contains a lot of data, 2. This application\u2019s design will only look good when opened by using a laptop or a computer, 3. In making the material, it can only be shared into the Study Program categorySemester, and it cannot be shared with each class. 4. There may be the possibility of sending the material incorrectly. 5. This application does not have the facilities for importing and exporting user data. 6. In making multiple-choice question assignments, there is still a manual import feature, 7. E-learning does not have a Video Conference feature, 8. In printing grades into a file pdf, an additional application is required. 9. E-learning cannot record learning and participants in a video. 10. This application does not have an installer version on the android/smartphone.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWe studied the impact of several smoking cessation-based scenarios on future pancreatic cancer incidence in the European Union by means of computer simulation.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nAmong other data, published data on pancreatic cancer incidence rate and smoking prevalence in ten member states of the European Union, and on the relative risk of smoking were entered into a simulation model. Four different scenarios were simulated: one reference scenario, one based on theoretically maximal smoking reduction and two feasible scenarios based on WHO's Health for All targets. In each scenario, pancreatic cancer incidence was computed from 1994 up to the year 2020. Results were extrapolated to the European Union as a whole.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhen the percentage of smokers remains unchanged, 627,000 and 588,000 newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer cases among males and females respectively will arise in the European Union up to 2020. Theoretically, if all smokers would give up smoking instantly, this number can be reduced by 133,000 cases among men and 43,000 cases among women. In more feasible scenarios up to 35,500 male and 32,500 female pancreatic cancer cases can be prevented.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGiving up smoking substantially reduces future burden of pancreatic cancer up to almost 68,000 patients in the European Union up to the year 2020.",

Original research articles made between 1941-2021 containing the keywords \"diabetic\", \"DM\" and \"retinopathy\" and \"article\" in the title, abstract, and keywords were found. Publications were evaluated in terms of the institution, author, publication year, subject, number of citations, and the journal in which they were published.\nResults: It was determined that there were 58,516 publications on DR, and the first publication was published in 1941. 41,996 of them were research papers. Only research articles were evaluated in our study. It was determined that there was an increase in the number of articles after the 1960s and that the year 2020 was the year in which the highest number of articles were published (6.3%). The United States (21.9%) and China (10.6%) were the countries with the highest number of articles. Turkey ranked 13th. The journals in which the highest number of articles were published were Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science (3.1%) and Ophthalmology (1.9%). The third leading institution with the most articles; Harvard Medical School (1.4%), University of Melbourne (1.1%), and Wilmer Eye Institute (1%). \nConclusion: The increase in scientific research on DR, both on treatment and prevention, causes an increase in the number of publications. The ranking of our country should be raised to higher levels in this regard.",

    "abstract": "Music visualization is a visual art form for understanding, analyzing and comparing the internal structure and expressive features of music. It meets the aesthetic demand of the masses in the digital age. This paper reviews the development and research status of the music visualization literature in the past 20 years, comprehensively analyzes the research process and current hotspots of music visualization, and speculates the future development trend. We have used Web of Science (WoS) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) as data sources, used CiteSpace software to compare and analyze the year, country, subject distribution and hot keywords of music visualization literature at China and the world from 2000 to 2020 by the method of Mapping Knowledge Domain. The results show that the research on music visualization at China and other countries is showing an upward trend, and it presents the characteristics of multi-disciplinary integration. Different application scenarios, research methods and development stages lead to different research hotspots between different countries. The shortcomings of Chinese research in this field lies in that the research content needs to be deepened, the interdisciplinary content needs to be integrated, and applications of music visualization needs to be popularized.",

    "title": "Physical Health Status Analysis of Elementary School Students and the Countermeasures under the Background of Informatization : \u2014A Case Study of Huayang Elementary School, Tianhe District, Guangzhou City",
    "abstract": "As mentioned, the first time, in National Education Reform and Development of Long-Term Planning Programs (2010-2020) printed and distributed by the State Council in 2010, information technology, which was of revolutionary significance to education development, must arouse high attention. In Ten-Year Development Plan of Educational Informatization (2011-2020) issued by the Ministry of Education in 2012, the educational modernization should be driven by education informatization. The development of big data, artificial intelligence, and science & technology has facilitated the information-based teaching. Elementary school students (7-12 years old) in Huayang Elementary School, Tianhe District, Guangzhou City, were selected as the study objects and analyzed via the literature review method, mathematical statistics, etc. The physical heath data in 2020 were chosen and compared with the mean value of national physical health in 2014. The factors restricting the physical health of elementary school students were found with the help of information technology, thus providing a method for further improving their physical health. The results showed that the body shape indexes of students who were 7-13 years old from Huayang Elementary School, Tianhe District, Guangzhou City, were all slightly lower than national mean level. Most of their body functions and physical qualities, such as vital capacity, 50 m race, sit and reach, sit-ups and 50 m*8 endurance running, were higher than national mean values, and obvious differences were manifested. Those who reached outstanding performance in rope skipping accounted for over 50%. Conclusion: Based on the information technology, the overall physical health status in Huayang Elementary School, Tianhe District, Guangzhou City, was superior to the national mean level in 2014, but their body shape index was still poorer than national mean value. Therefore, the elementary school students\u2019 sport performance should be improved by means of informatization, but moreover, they should be guided by the information technology to cultivate correct concepts of sports and good consciousness of voluntary exercise, in an effort to improve the physical health of Chinese adolescents fundamentally.",

    "abstract": "The need for innovative changes in the fight against crime and the necessity to revise the established paradigms of forensic science was bound to reflect in forensic didactics. The academics\ufffd expectations of practice not only call for a new approach to the content and forms of legal education but also for a dialogue with students, who are increasingly shifting from passive consumers of knowledge to active participants in the study process to eventually become the future initiators and implementers of innovation. Although the authors of the present article have been working with forensic didactics for decades, they are constantly looking for new forms and methods of didactics to apply the achievements of forensic didactics in the practical activities of law enforcement institutions as effectively as possible. One of the examples is the new study programme Law and Forensic Science, available at Mykolas Romeris University as of 2020. This bachelor\ufffds study programme was designed upon holding a discussion with the Lithuanian Ministry of Education, Science and Sports and taking into account the National Courts Administration\ufffds request to step up the teaching of forensic science and forensic examination at Lithuanian universities; furthermore, as the study process has been launched, a student opinion survey is now carried out on a regular basis. The questionnaires, as well as this publication, aim to not only analyse and evaluate students\ufffd reasoning behind choosing this programme, their attitude towards the study process, and their expectations regarding their future profession, but also to promptly improve the online study process. Surveys are carried out upon enrolment and after each year of study, or even after each semester, to find solutions and accordingly adjust some elements and processes of the curriculum. The present article introduces the key results of three questionnaires. The surveys indicated a further increase in the level of relevance of forensic classes, a pragmatic understanding of the role of forensic knowledge and skills in future employment, the relationship between theoretical and practical classes, and the directions of professional competence development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Advances in computer technology, the development of GIS application software, and the ability to access various geographic data through open-source data sources have allowed police and law enforcement agencies to use it effectively. Crime mapping and spatial analysis using GIS tools such as hotspot generation, zoning, crime navigation and profiling, mobile location recognition, and various web applications are clearly recognized and can be scientifically applied to improve citizenship while being effectively used to predict and control crime. The present study analyzed the trends and patterns of crime data (murder, rape, robbery, theft, kidnapping, engraving, and gambling) in Ajmer Zone from 2015\u20132022 (till October) to understand the trends of crime data (IPC crime registered). I also used the demographic data of Ajmer to understand crime trends towards various crime types The study focused on the most common crimes reported, which were theft and gambling, as opposed to murder, rape, kidnapping, and robbery. All crimes were reported in 1,009 incidents in 2015. In 2016, 1,064 cases were recorded. In 2017, 1081 cases were reported. In 2018, 1034 cases were reported. In 2019, 1415 cases were reported. In 2020, 829 cases were reported. In 2011, 1120 cases were reported. In 2022, 1268 cases were reported. The highest number of cases occurred in 2017, 2019, and 2022, and the lowest number of cases occurred in 2015 and 2016. According to the crime study for 2015\u20132022 (till October), I found that many areas where crime is increasing or that are crime hotspots are found every year.",

This research was carried out in a state high school in Jakarta, Indonesia. The test is carried out during the first semester of the 2019/2020 school year. The research method implemented in the study is a quasi-experiment with treatment design by level 2x2, then the data acquired are analyzed with two-way ANOVA. The research sample consists of 40 science students in grade 10, and then the sample is divided into two categorized, namely the experiment class of 20 students and the control class of 20 students. They are selected by a multi-stage random sampling technique. In the experiment class, the learning process used mobile learning media while in the control class, the learning process used traditional or conventional media. Scientific reasoning tests and creative thinking tests are the test instruments used in this research. The result shows that students who learn through mobile learning have higher creative thinking skills than those who learn through traditional media. The result also shows that there is an effect of mobile learning media interaction and scientific reasoning ability on students\u2019 creative thinking. The use of mobile learning media has positive impacts on students\u2019 creative thinking for students who have high scientific reasoning. On the other hand, it has negative impacts on students' creative thinking for students who have lower scientific reasoning.",

Without mitigation and adaptation measures, sea level rise scenarios project annual losses of 0.3\u20139.3% of global GDP by 2100 (IPCC, 2019;equivalent to ~US$0.25 to US$7.88 trillion per year based on 2020 GDP, World Bank, 2021), while losses from declines in ocean health and services by 2050 are projected to be US$428 billion per year, and by 2100 US$1.979 trillion per year. Over the last decade, a number of programmes and projects have driven international efforts to develop the integration of human systems in global ocean ecosystem science, including the Integrated Marine Biosphere Research (IMBeR) project (Hofmann et al., 2015) to which the authors contribute. To help meet this challenge, the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030 (UNESCO-IOC, 2021) provides an opportunity to build global support systems for informing decision making on the critical time scales of the coming years and decades.",

    "title": "Seed Hydropriming Duration for Potential Seedling Vigour in Pigeon Pea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.], Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and Rice (Oryza sativa L.)",
    "abstract": "Background: In the climate change scenario, the increasing frequency of drought is the major constraint for crop yields. Under rainfed conditions, the most vulnerable stage of the crop cycle is seed germination and seedling establishment. One of the approaches to enhance the seedling establishment is hydropriming or seed hardening. Hydropriming is a recommended practice for rainfed crops to improve the appropriate crop stand and productivity. For effective hydropriming, the priming duration is crucial because a lesser duration of priming will be ineffective, a longer duration will damage the seed coat, embryonic axis and the seed will fail to germinate. The detailed investigation on optimal priming duration in major pulse (pigeon pea), oilseed (sunflower) and cereal (rice) is scanty. Methods: Hence, the effect of priming duration on the imbibition rate and seedling establishment in major pulse (pigeon pea, cv. BRG-5), oilseed (sunflower hybrid, KBSH-78) and food crop (rice, cv. MTU-1001) was conducted in the laboratory, Department of Crop Physiology, University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, India during the year 2020. The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design with 14 soaking period treatments and five replications for imbibition studies and three replications for seedling establishment in the field. Result: The imbibition rate was rapid in the beginning hours and reached zero by 10 to 12 hours. The cumulative imbibition of 30-40% was attained in the first 2-3 hours of priming in pigeon pea and sunflower and 11 hours in rice. Similarly, 2-3 hours of hydropriming resulted in higher SVI-II (field establishment), but a 7-8 hour period of priming showed the highest seedling growth and seedling vigor index in all three crops. Therefore, 3-hour hydropriming is critical and can be extended to 7-8 hours for better seedling establishment in pigeon pea, sunflower and rice.\n",

    "abstract": "The issue of research deals with the volume of changes that may occur in the level of mechanical inflammatory activities of skeletal muscle (CRP), and whether these changes are related to the level of physical efficiency and the accomplishment for anaerobic effort post weekly training course. Moreover, there is no field data or it could be conflicting if any, which deals with the level of inflammatory activities for muscles within a week of repeated exposure to codified physical effort and its relationship with the level of physical accomplishment of a 100-meter running. Goal of research: Revealing the level of mechanical inflammatory activities of skeletal muscle between pre and post-tests, as well as revealing the relationship between inflammatory activities and the level of physical accomplishment of a 100-meter running. Researchers hypothesized: The presence of immaterial differences in the circumstances of pre, and post weekly training course, that could affect the level of physical accomplishment of a100-meter running. They also hypothesized the presence of immaterial differences in the circumstances of pre, and post weekly training course, that would represent a demolishing muscle tissue indicator. This research was conducted on: A sample of practitioners of sports activities, where the researchers had used experimental method designed for one group of both tests (pre and post) given its suitability for the nature of research. The sample of research consisted of (11) individuals whom intentionally selected, as their rate of ages, weights, and heights ranged between (19 years.), (65 kg), and (173 cm) respectively. The experiments took place at university of Mosul stadium for the period from 18-1-2020 to 26-1-2020, where the sample members had conducted the physical performance of 100- meter running pre and post the training course. Having conducted first main experiment of a 100-meter running, pre-test of (CRP) was taken (pre- course), and the same procedure was followed in second main experiment, post weekly training course.The researchers discovered :Repetition of physical effort during a weekly training course had improved the level of indication of muscular tissue inflammation, and enhanced the level of physical achievement of a 100-meter freestyle running. The researchers recommended: Taking advantage of current study and should be widely invested particularly in the practical classes for the College of Physical Education and Sports Science where its syllabus depends on the repetition of exciting performance to enhance the performance during the academic year .",

    "abstract": "Introduction. The article is devoted to the study of the relationship of students\u2019 creativity and their emotional well-being during the period of forced distance learning. It was found that students with a higher creative potential easier coped with periods of social restrictions, felt less anxiety, were better satisfied with the distance learning process, while experiencing a lack of face-to-face communication with the instructor.Aim. The aim of the current research was to identify the relationship between students\u2019 creativity and their emotional well-being during the period of forced self-isolation in 2020\u20132021.Methodology and research methods. The research was carried out within the framework of health care pedagogy. The methodological basis of the study included pedagogical principles of promotion, maintenance and restoration of emotional health; development of knowledge, skills and abilities to maintain emotional health especially during online studies. Creativity was measured with the Torrance test of creative thinking; emotional state \u2013 with a well-being questionnaire created by the authors on the Google Forms platform. The study population was represented by 387 1\u20134-year bachelors studying the humanities (Philology, Linguistics, History, Sociology and Pedagogy) and technical sciences (Petroleum Engineering, Computer Science) at the Tyumen Industrial University, Tyumen State University and South Ural State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University.Results. Statistical analysis confirmed the hypothesis about the relationship of students\u2019 creativity and their emotional well-being during the quarantine period. Students with higher scores on the Originality scale experienced less anxiety and stress during the quarantine period (r = \u20130.36*). A negative relationship was found between the variables \u201cOriginality\u201d and \u201cComfort in using PPE\u201d (r = \u20130.38*), \u201cDevelopment\u201d and \u201cSatisfaction with communication with the instructor\u201d (r = \u20130.41**), \u201cFluency\u201d and \u201cComfort of using PPE\u201d (r = \u20130.49**). The ways of stress relief used by students during the period of self-isolation were identified and described. It was found that more than half of the students intuitively chose creative activities (61.3%) to improve their well-being.Scientific novelty. The scientific novelty lies in an attempt to present students\u2019 creativity as a resource that requires special activation during the period of forced self-isolation within the general framework of health care pedagogy.Practical significance. Eleven forms and methods of creative interaction with students are suggested. Research findings aim at forming health preserving skills in students, especially during distance learning, by stimulating their creative resources.",

    "title": "STUDIES ON THE IMPACT OF WORK FROM HOME DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW",
    "abstract": "When the pandemic outbreak happened back in the year 2020, the Government and the policymakers took preventive steps and directive measures to sustain social movement and infection among the citizens. Common action that has been taken globally was the implementation of lockdown. Consequently, non-essential businesses or organizations had to resolve to transition from central office to work-from-home for as long as the lockdown period ended. This has brought a greater change in the world of work and boosted the experimentation of work-from-home arrangements worldwide. Despite it being a practice that some may have experienced before, it is still relatively uncommon and unusual to be done on such a large scale for some countries. Therefore, many are interested to see the outcome of work-from-home, the impact it had on employers, employees, and companies. However, the ample amount of works of literature made it hard to distinguish the direction and trend of this research. This paper aims to identify and highlight the major findings on the impacts of work-from-home by reviewing 55 published papers in the year between 2020 to 2021 and analyze them through a thematic analysis. The results show 60 percent of these studies are covered by the field of social sciences which both involve developed and developing countries. Nevertheless, the impact of work-from-home was found common as the problem used to arise even before the pandemic happened. This gives an opportunity in future studies to finally resolve some of these problems if work-from-home soon becomes the 'new norm' in the world of work.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background dialogue between the teaching profession and researchers regarding pedagogical strategy is sometimes problematic. Pedagogy research may benefit from incorporating research methods that can investigate teachers\u2019 and pupils\u2019 interpretations. Purpose this research expands the Pedagogy Analysis Framework (Riordan, 2020) by explaining in detail the meso-strategies (tactics) and a macro-strategy (grand strategy) used by participants in three school science lessons about chromatography. The research design builds on previous work by using full lessons and introducing pupil group verbal protocols. In addition, Pedagogy Analysis Notation is introduced to help understand and explain macro-strategic behaviours. Sample one class of thirty 13-year-old pupils and one science teacher. Design and method four research methods were used (lesson video analysis, teacher verbal protocols, pupil group verbal protocols and researcher group interviews). Data were video recorded (managed using NVivo). Fourteen hours of video data were analysed using Grounded Theory Methods by two educational researchers and the class teacher. The interpretivist theoretical perspective (symbolic interactionism) was underpinned by a social constructionist epistemology (hence the methodology is Straussian Grounded Theory). Appropriate criteria for evaluating the emergent grounded theory were used. Data were recorded in 2017. Results the Pedagogy Analysis Framework uses the concepts: means (human and non-human), strategy (a spectrum from micro-strategies (actions), through meso-strategies (tactics) to macro-strategies (grand strategies)), ends (regarding the self, another person or a thing, or a group of people or things), and accidents. Types of tactics identified in these data were: inform (misinform and disinform), question, instruct, use space/time, repeat, train, assess, and interact. Pedagogy Analysis Notation is used to understand and explain \u2018the stationary [sic] cupboard\u2019 incident. Conclusion the extended Pedagogy Analysis Framework, combined with the Pedagogy Analysis Notation, improves strategic dialogue between teachers, pupils and educational researchers. This research design facilitates comparison of interpretations of classroom pedagogy by a teacher, pupils and two researchers.",

    "title": "Comparing graduate occupational therapy students\u2019 perceived time use, temporality, and tempo of occupational participation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The study of time use, habits, routines, and rituals is significant to occupational science inquiry, with established research techniques and numerous published reports documenting the temporal nature of human occupational behavior. Occupational therapy graduate students are therefore instructed on time use analysis methods. In a large public American university graduate program, self-evaluation of time use is used as a learning strategy, providing students rich opportunities to apply what they learn in class to gain a better understanding of their own lives. Following didactic instruction, the students in an introductory theory course were asked to document and reflect upon their time use on a recent day or week in spring 2019. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a statewide stay-at-home order and widespread school closures, including the conversion of all coursework to alternative online methods. In this context, the students in the following cohort completed the time use documentation and reflection assignment in spring 2020. The data from these assignments provide a unique opportunity to compare time use in the midst of a global pandemic to time use in the prior year. Anonymous data were compared between graduate student cohorts from the spring 2020 semester (n\u2009=\u200959) and spring 2019 (n\u2009=\u200958). Data were compiled and analyzed using NVivo software for qualitative analysis, and SPSS software for quantitative investigation. Results indicate that students attempted to self-organize their time with an emphasis on maintaining or correcting perceived shifts in temporarily and tempo. Students cited concern for their health and reported adjusting patterns of occupational engagement in studying, sleep, rest, and community mobility. Future research should query students\u2019 motivations and feelings related to time use and perception of time.",

    "title": "Socioeconomic status determines COVID-19 incidence and related mortality in Santiago, Chile",
    "abstract": "Urban socioeconomics and mortality Santiago, Chile, is a highly segregated city with distinct zones of affluence and deprivation. This setting offers a window on how social factors propel the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in an economically vulnerable society with high levels of income inequality. Mena et al. analyzed incidence and mortality attributed to SARS-CoV-2 to understand spatial variations in disease burden. Infection fatality rates were higher in lower-income municipalities because of comorbidities and lack of access to health care. Disparities between municipalities in the quality of their health care delivery system became apparent in testing delays and capacity. These indicators explain a large part of the variation in COVID-19 underreporting and deaths and show that these inequalities disproportionately affected younger people. Science, abg5298, this issue p. eabg5298 The consequences of health care inequalities have been exacerbated during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a large, economically vulnerable city. INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 crisis has exposed major inequalities between communities. Understanding the societal risk factors that make some groups particularly vulnerable is essential to ensure more effective interventions for this and future pandemics. Here, we focus on socioeconomic status as a risk factor. Although it is broadly understood that social and economic inequality has a negative impact on health outcomes, the mechanisms by which socioeconomic status affects disease outcomes remain unclear. These mechanisms can be mediated by a range of systemic structural factors, such as access to health care and economic safety nets. We address this gap by providing an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. RATIONALE Combining publicly available data sources, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of case incidence and mortality during the first wave of the pandemic. We correlated COVID-19 outcomes with behavioral and health care system factors while studying their interaction with age and socioeconomic status. To overcome the intrinsic biases of incomplete case count data, we used detailed mortality data. We developed a parsimonious Gaussian process model to study excess deaths and their uncertainty and reconstructed true incidence from the time series of deaths with a new regularized maximum likelihood deconvolution method. To estimate infection fatality rates by age and socioeconomic status, we implemented a hierarchical Bayesian model that adjusts for reporting biases while accounting for incompleteness in case information. RESULTS We find robust associations between COVID-19 outcomes and socioeconomic status, based on health and behavioral indicators. Specifically, we show in lower\u2013socioeconomic status municipalities that testing was almost absent early in the pandemic and that human mobility was not reduced by lockdowns as much as it was in more affluent locations. Test positivity and testing delays were much higher in these locations, indicating an impaired capacity of the health care system to contain the spread of the epidemic. We also find that 73% more deaths than in a normal year were observed between May and July 2020, and municipalities at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum were hit the hardest, both in relation to COVID-19\u2013attributed deaths and excess deaths. Finally, the socioeconomic gradient of the infection fatality rate appeared particularly steep for younger age groups, reflecting worse baseline health status and limited access to health care in municipalities with low socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION Together, these findings highlight the substantial consequences of socioeconomic and health care disparities in a highly segregated city and provide practical methodological approaches useful for characterizing the COVID-19 burden and mortality in other urban centers based on public data, even if reports are incomplete and biased. Effect of socioeconomic inequalities on COVID-19 outcomes. The map on the left shows the municipalities that were included in this study, colored by their socioeconomic status score. For the comparison between COVID-19 deaths and excess deaths (top right), COVID-19\u2013confirmed deaths are shown in light green and COVID-19\u2013attributed deaths in dark green. Excess deaths, shown in gray, correspond to the difference between observed and predicted deaths. Predicted deaths were estimated using a Gaussian process model. The shading indicates 95% credible intervals for the excess deaths. The infection fatality rates (bottom right) were inferred by implementing a hierarchical Bayesian model, with vertical lines representing credible intervals by age and socioeconomic status. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected cities particularly hard. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. Our analyses show a strong association between socioeconomic status and both COVID-19 outcomes and public health capacity. People living in municipalities with low socioeconomic status did not reduce their mobility during lockdowns as much as those in more affluent municipalities. Testing volumes may have been insufficient early in the pandemic in those places, and both test positivity rates and testing delays were much higher. We find a strong association between socioeconomic status and mortality, measured by either COVID-19\u2013attributed deaths or excess deaths. Finally, we show that infection fatality rates in young people are higher in low-income municipalities. Together, these results highlight the critical consequences of socioeconomic inequalities on health outcomes.",

    "title": "Analog Church: Why We Need Real People, Places and Things in the Digital Age",
    "abstract": "ANALOG CHURCH: Why We Need Real People, Places and Things in the Digital Age by Jay Y. Kim. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2020. 192 pages. Paperback; $18.00. ISBN: 9780830841585. *There is a thought-provoking irony about this book. Analog Church: Why We Need Real People, Places and Things in the Digital Age by Jay Y. Kim was written prior to the 2020 pandemic, and published at its first peak around March of that year. The book serves as a creative warning about the church \"over-embracing\" modern technology and all that the digital age offers, at the cost of stifling its original purpose, a purpose steeped in analog principles of empathetic relationship. Fair enough! But along come the COVID-19 restrictions, and the church (and every other part of our institutionalized life) jumps full steam ahead as digital technology becomes essential. My own perspective is from Canadian Presbyterianism. It, with some exception, has been slow to embrace many technological advances when it comes to \"doing church.\" Nonetheless, it and many other churches have been dragged into the twenty-first century with near abandon. The number of churches doing meetings and Sunday worship via YouTube, Zoom, Facebook, and other platforms has skyrocketed. *The prophetic voice inherent in Analog Church is speaking to the church community at a time when it is relying on digital technology to continue functioning. The introductory section of the book focuses on how technology, in and of itself, is not adequate to reach those who are searching for a transcendent meaning and purpose in life, and may, in fact, steer people away from such a relationship. In an introductory section entitled \"When Values Turn Vicious,\" the author notes that \"the digital age's technological advancements boast three major contributions to the improvement of human experience ...\" (p. 15). These are speed, choices, and individualism. He notes that when such values unduly influence the church and aren't held accountable, \"they turn vicious.\" Speed has made us impatient, choices have made us shallow, individualism has made us isolated. *It is on this premise that the author uses the remainder of the book to detail his warnings and his reasons for hope. The chapter titles are provided here, as they are descriptive of the content. Part 1 has two chapters which examine worship: \"Cameras, Copycats and Caricatures: Worship in the Digital Age\"; and \"To Engage and to Witness: Analog Worship.\" Part 2 considers community: \"Rebuilding Babel: Community in the Digital Age\"; and \"A Tax Collector and a Zealot Walk into A Crossfit: Analog Community.\" Part 3 looks at scripture: \"Jackpot: Scripture in the Digital Age\"; \"HowToReadABook: Analog Scripture\"; and \"The Meal at the Center of History: Communion.\" *An example of the author's approach can be taken from the section on worship. He has the reader consider \"how the digital age and technology's influence have subverted much of what worship life of the gathered people of God is meant to be\" (p. 35), in part in the church's effort to reach new generations. Here he invokes the wisdom of Canadian philosopher and media guru Marshall McLuhan. He notes how McLuhan's 1960's prophetic voice is making a return due to the precise nature of his pronouncements, and how they match current circumstances. He summarizes McLuhan's \"Four Laws of Media\" (media in a very broad sense), as applicable to our use of technology today in the church, and, in this case, worship. The laws are summarized as follows: what does it enhance, what does it push aside, what does it retrieve that was previously pushed aside, and, what does it turn into when pushed to an extreme? As Kim moves into the value of analog worship, he notes that \"digital informs,\" but \"analog transforms,\" and similarly, \"digital entertains, analog engages.\" *The author works into his narrative a number of stories based on his own life experiences, and pastors and speakers will find these worthy of using in their own teaching. While there are biblical references scattered throughout, this reviewer particularly appreciates the detailed way some scriptural passages are handled. For example, in the section regarding analog community, the author takes an extended look at the list of the first disciples in Matthew 10:2-4. He pays particular attention to the unique descriptors for two of them: Matthew, a tax collector; and Simon, a zealot. These two would have been bitter enemies, yet we read nothing of the animosity that would have existed between them. There was something, a force, contained in their leader that was much stronger than their own histories and opinions of one another. Kim later notes that there is the need for this kind of communal relationship, as \"the digital age has disconnected and detached us from one another in ways completely unique to our current moment in history. True analog community is what the world is hungry for, whether they know it or not\" (p.113). *The author is certainly no luddite. He applauds the use of digital technology when properly focused. He himself lives in the heart of Silicon Valley, and, in many ways, he has been at the cutting edge of digital technology and its use in the church. He is the lead pastor of teaching at WestGate Church in the same area, and until recently was teacher-in-residence at Vintage Faith Church in Santa Cruz. He cohosts The Regeneration Podcast. He has a very useful website (jaykimthinks.com), and he makes himself readily available via Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. All this is to say that Jay Kim has considerable credibility concerning the subject matter of this book. In fact, on the March 22, 2020, version of Regeneration Podcast, there is a specific commentary about the book, with some pandemic perspective as well. One of the book's phrases which is featured in the podcast discussion is \"the temptation to pursue relevance at any cost.\" The podcast is a good resource for those considering getting the book. *ASA/CSCA members might well be wondering if the book is primarily for pastors and church leaders (which group, of course, includes a number of our members). As for those involved with the scientific endeavor, there are also some worthy considerations. This reviewer has long considered scientific activity as a form of worship, and the work of the ASA as an important ministry in itself. Many of the warnings that Jay Kim provides in his book can be easily transferred to those who share the importance of a vital science and faith relationship. In fact, it is about relationship. Digital \"spectacle\" may be a useful and inspiring aspect of short-term events and conferences, but the purpose of both church and our individual witness is quite different. It requires an analog approach, enhanced by a subtle and reflective use of technology which builds upon the purpose of churches and congregations, but does not replace it. In conclusion, I would recommend this book to ASA members interested in how digital technology shapes the church. *Reviewed by Bob Geddes, a geologist and minister (retired) in the Presbyterian Church in Canada, Hamilton, ON L9A 4Y2.",

    "abstract": "Seed germination, following seedling growth are basic but crucial steps in a plant life cycle which includes proper seed germination which is a basic pre-requisite for a better crop growth and yield. The experiment was conducted in Vegetable Science Department under the Defence Institute of Bio-Energy and Research (DIBER), (DRDO), Pithoragarh, Uttarakhand in the year 2020-2021 to standardize the best treatment of seed priming specific to Spinach (Spinacia oleracea). An investigation was conducted both in a laboratory and on the field with the same treatment that was: (T1) Distilled water, (T2) 1%NaCl, (T3) 1%H2O2, (T4) 1%Na2CO3, (T5) Tap water, (T6) 1%DAP, (T7) Control. Seeds were soaked for 16 hrs and then dried to original moisture content for 2 days. It was found that all the priming treatments showed a significant difference with the control and the highest germination %(lab) with 71% was observed in seeds treated with DAP (T6) and the highest crop yield (field) were observed for 1% Na2CO3. Na2CO3 showed the best result in the field as well as in lab conditions based on different quality parameters followed by DAP. This study showed that seed priming treatments help in the enhancement of seed quality parameters, proved cost-effective and the most economical method. The experiment helps to improve the seed quality using different priming treatments which are cost-effective, economic, environment friendly and one of the quickest methods used for seed enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Grafting technology in vegetable crops is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative tool to improve the biotic and abiotic resistance besides improvement in horticultural traits. By utilizing the right combination of resistant rootstock and scion, desired variability can be achieved to improve the yield and quality of vegetables. A study was conducted at the College orchard, Department of Vegetable science, Horticultural College and Research Institute, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore during the year 2020-2021 to evaluate the graft compatibility with two chilli rootstocks. The experimental material consisted of two perennial rootstocks viz., CC-CBE-001 and CF-CBE-007 and three scion materials viz., TNAU Chilli Hybrid CO 1, Ranga hybrid and Bangaram hybrid. Wedge grafting was done using 60 days old rootstock and 45 days old scion seedlings with nine treatments. The adhesion line wall thickness of pith cells were determined at different stages after grafting. The wound healing of the scion-rootstock union was studied using microscopic examination of the grafting region on the 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th day after grafting. It was observed that ten days after grafting, vascular bundle was formed and a large amount of callus was produced to bridge the scion and rootstock. Despite interspecific grafting, callus formation, subsequent cell differentiation and vascular connection were established, resulting in effective graft compatibility, according to the anatomical and histological analysis.",

    "abstract": "Research and Development (R&D) measurements are widely used in the formulation of evidence-based policies to boost a country\u2019s innovation performance. This paper showcases how traditional (Expenditure and Number of Researchers) and country specific R&D data were used for the first time in Mauritius to formulate informed policy measures. A national survey covering the financial year 2019/2020 was conducted. Five hundred and fifty-three Researchers (Full Time Equivalence) per million of inhabitants were recorded. Gross Expenditure and Business R&D Expenditures as a percentage of GDP were 0.37% and 0.07% respectively. Highest expenditures for Business, Government and Higher Education sectors were in Engineering & Technology, Agricultural and Natural Sciences respectively, hence demonstrating a lack of synergy between the three sectors. Bibliometric analysis was conducted to evaluate the trend in publication output over the last five years. 6.2% of Mauritian publications were in Ocean Sciences and 21% of international publications were co-authored with a partner from Africa. These call for a realignment of R&D strategies for Mauritius to attain its goals to become a Blue Economy and a regional knowledge hub. Potential policy recommendations include mechanisms to be put in place for enhanced- public/private sector dialogue and targeted Research Funding schemes in relation to country goals.",

    "abstract": "Dear Readers,\n It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to our first regular issue in 2021 covering 3 very relevant and novel articles in various computer science topics.\n There are also many news and changes with the beginning of the new year that I am excited to report on and share. To start with, we are very happy to welcome two new consortium members and editors-in-chief: California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo represented by Prof. Christian Eckhardt from the Department of Computer Science & Software Engineering and the Institute for IDEAS at American University in Washington DC represented by Prof. Krzysztof Pietroszek. On the management side of J.UCS, Dana Kaiser has retired at the end of last year, and on behalf of the journal I want to gratefully thank Dana for her devoted and great work since the foundation of this journal. I also want to give Johanna Zeisberg a warm welcome who will take over the role as Publishing Manager and collaborate and support the whole J.UCS community. On the technical side, our journal has moved to another submission and publishing platform. Since the foundation of J.UCS more than 25 years ago, the journal has offered readers, authors and editors various novel features over the course of the years. In this perspective but also in terms of the visionary view of founding a freely accessibly online journal, I want to express our deep gratitude for the contributions of Prof. Hermann Maurer to the success of J.UCS for almost 20 years. Since beginning of 2021, J.UCS is hosted by Pensoft Publishers Ltd. on the ARPHA Publishing Platform. This allows us not only to offer state-of-the-art publishing features but also to make use of integrated long-time archiving systems and various indexing services. In this context I also want to thank Internet Studio Isser and Photographer Christian Trummer for the kind support in the development of the design update and the J.UCS images.\n In this first issue of the year, I also want to look back on the journal\u2019s achievements in 2020. We are proud to report a total of 11 issues with 74 articles on novel aspects of various topics in computer science; to be more specific, 51 articles have been published in 7 special issues and 23 articles in 4 regular issues. Since last year, J.UCS publishes under the open access Creative Commons License CC BY-ND 4.0 and therefore provides even more value und openness to a broader community. In 2020, we counted more than 87 thousand unique visits and almost 65 thousand paper downloads. This success is only possible due to the great support of the involved institutions, reviewers and authors, and I want to gratefully thank them all for their valuable support and work. Over the years we have not only offered readers open access to our high-quality journal, but we also do not charge our authors publication fees. This adventurous approach together with a rigorous review process and a broad support by the community resulted in a valuable contribution in the field of computer science, which is reflected in the high number of unique visitors and article downloads. In this context I gratefully thank all consortium members for their financial support of J.UCS.\n I am looking forward to continuing the cooperation with our editors, the editorial team and the technical support to maintain the success of J.UCS. I would be very grateful for suggestions and feedback on how we can even improve and develop J.UCS in the future.\n In this regular issue, I am very pleased to introduce 3 accepted papers from 5 different countries.\n On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the J.UCS journal, Nelson Baloian, Jos\u00e9 A. Pino, Gustavo Zurita, Valeria Lobos-Ossand\u00f3n, and Hermann Maurer analyze and discuss a bibliometric overview of the first 25 years of the journal in their collaboration between Austria and Chile. In a collaborative research between China and Spain, Xin Liu, Xiaoying Song, Wei Gao, Li Zou, and Alvaro Labella Romero report on their decision making approach based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic-valued credibility reasoning. And finally, Christian Moreira Matos, Vitor Kehl Matter, Marcio Garcia Martins, Joao Elison Da Rosa Tavares, Alexandre Sturmer Wolf, Paulo Cesar Buttenbender, and Jorge Luis Victoria Barbosa from Brazil discuss a collaborative model to assist people with disabilities and the elderly people in smart assistive cities.\n Enjoy Reading!",

    "title": "Pivoting in a Pandemic: Transitioning from In-person to Virtual K-8 Computing Professional Development",
    "abstract": "This poster reports on year one of a three-year NSF-funded Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP) to develop a K-8 pipeline for computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky : Pikeville Independent School District and Floyd County Schools. Economically devastated by the departure of the coal industry, these communities are committed to developing high-quality computing curricula for all students, beginning in their earliest years. The poster has two components. First, through a mixture of qualitative measures, the poster reports on the genesis and development of the RPP. It focuses on the RPP's origin in leveraging the districts' existing relationship with Pennsylvania's South Fayette School District, which has developed one of the nation's leading programs for teacher professional development (PD) in K-12 computing. The second component of the poster focuses on the development of a series of summer workshops for Kentucky Appalachia K-8 instructors to learn the basics of CS and CT and how to integrate these skills and concepts into existing K-8 coursework. Of course, the RPP faced new challenges with COVID-19 most notably, the need to offer these summer workshops remotely, and adjusting the objectives and research questions accordingly. Through focus groups with the PD instructional team and survey responses from the KY teacher workshop participants, the poster will report on the pedagogical implications of offering teacher PD exclusively online and what the ramifications have been for Pikeville and Floyd County children with the return to school in the Fall of 2020.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this article is to determine and compare the diagnostic accuracies of contrastenhanced FLAIR and T1W sequences of MRI brain in the detection of meningitis keeping lumbar puncture asgold standard.Study Design: Cross-sectional validation study.Place and Duration of Study: The study was carried out at Department of Diagnostic Radiology of POFHospital, Wah Cantt from 23 June 2019 to 22 March 2020.Materials and Methods: A total of 173 patients were included in the study by non-probability purposivesampling. Patients of age between 2-70 years, of either gender with suspected meningitis based on clinicalpresentation are included in our study. Patients in whom contrast enhanced MRI and lumbar puncture wascontraindicated, diagnosed patient of meningitis and non-consenting patients were excluded from this study.All patients received intravenous contrast medium gadolinium at rate of 0.2 ml/second. Post gadolinium T1Wand post gadolinium FLAIR images were acquired and evaluated by a consultant radiologist. Findings wererecorded on a prescribed performa. Patients were followed and results of lumbar puncture were collected fromlaboratory.Result: The mean age was 26.4\u00b123.5 year ranging from 2 to 70 years. Out of 173 patients, 98 patients (56.6%)were male and 75 patients (43.4%) were female. Clinical presentations were as follows: poor feeding, irritabilityand lethargy 86 (49.7%), headache 137 (79.2%), nausea/vomiting 125 (72.3%), neck stiffness 89 (51.4%),altered level of consciousness 132 (76.3%), seizures 78 (45.1%) and local neurological deficit 45 (26%).Diagnostic accuracy of contrast enhanced MRI FLAIR in diagnosing meningitis taking lumbar puncture goldstandard showed sensitivity 91%, specificity 85%, PPV 87.6%, NPV 89.4% and diagnostic accuracy 88.4%.Diagnostic accuracy of contrast enhanced MRI T1W in the diagnosis of meningitis taking lumbar puncture goldstandard revealed sensitivity 60.2%, specificity 77.5%, PPV 75.6%, NPV 62.6% and diagnostic accuracy 68.2%.Conclusion: The sensitivity and specificity of post contrast FLAIR sequence is greater as compared to postcontrast T1W sequence to detect meningeal enhancement. Therefore, for all patients with suspicion ofmeningitis, post contrast FLAIR sequence should be added to MRI brain protocol as a routine sequence.How to cite this: Jawwad S, Gul N, Mehmood K, Iqbal B, Afzal K.

    "abstract": "Introduction. Managing the formal education system during COVID-19 has become an unwanted challenge for the academic community. Without suffi time for preparations, different models of distance education were applied. The aim was to ensure the continuity of teaching, to encourage the process of distance learning, and to enable their evaluation.Aim. This study aimed to analyse the opinions of students from the Department of Early Childhood Education (hereafter ECE) at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences (hereafter Faculty), University of Split, on their study conditions during the COVID-19 from March 2020. It was assumed that learning in an online environment encourages the development of new learning strategies. Family and work status and residence of students (in the place of study or outside it) were taken as predictor variables in assessing the quality and conditions of the study.Methodology and research methods. The research was conducted online at the end of the 2020 academic year when students gathered online teaching experiences. The Google Apps tool was used in the data collection process. The Ethics Committee of the Faculty at the University of Split gave its consent to the implementation of this research. During online teaching, all students are informed about the purpose and course of research. Research included 68,75 % students (n = 156) studying at the ECE Department. The following aspects were investigated: forms and frequencies of distance learning; the possibility of students\u2019 response to study obligations (due to closed libraries); difficulties, advantages and possibilities of conducting online teaching; students\u2019 dissatisfaction with the quality of the organisation and implementation of online teaching, and opportunities for quality development.Results. Findings identified difficulties in the lack of ICT competencies of both students and teachers, mixed-use of different platforms, workload and lack of adequate literature. Students assessed the greater availability of teaching materials and more reachable teachers as positive, and experience of discussions on social networks as one of the useful ways of distance learning. By exchanging the content of teaching materials, they developed new learning strategies and showed possible new adaptations to learning using social networking. Students\u2019 dissatisfaction with online teaching could be interpreted by their subjective reasons and contextual conditions.Scientific novelty. The data processed in this research are triangulated with worldwide research on study conditions during lockdowns. It can be concluded that regardless of the previous lockdowns basic use of ICT (sending and receiving seminar tasks over e-mail), most higher education institutions were not ready for an overall transition to online teaching. The findings point to the need for systematic research into the possibilities of applying new technologies in the study process (learning, availability of relevant sources, networking of scientists, and quality exchange of information).Practical significance. Given that before the COVID-19 at this Faculty there was no similar research, nor experience with any online teaching forms, it is difficult to determine the extent of the change. Nevertheless, it is possible to conclude that the teaching staff did not have adequate ICT competencies for the implementation of quality online teaching. The quality of teaching in this research was contributed by more reachable teaching staff and their willingness to cooperate. In the changed living conditions as a consequence of the pandemic, it is possible to expect further changes in the way of studying. The insight and analysis of students\u2019 opinions through this research could contribute to the development of the quality of the teaching process in any given crisis.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to determine the compliance of intern nurses with isolation precautions in the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic period. Methods: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with 4th-year intern nurses (n=90) receiving education at the vocational school of health of a state university in November 2020. The data were collected by using a Questionnaire Form and the \"Isolation Precautions Compliance Scale\". In data analysis, percentage, mean, Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used in the SPSS software. Results: The mean age of the intern nurses who participated in the study was 22\u00b11.43 years, 74.4% were female, 51.1% were graduates of Anatolian high schools. Intern nurses 95.6% had received training on isolation precautions, and 81.1% received this training from a course instructor during their undergraduate studies. In was determined that 71.1% of the participants provided nursing care for patients who were under isolation during clinical practice, and 91.1% had knowledge that isolation precautions need to be implemented in the nursing care of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean Isolation Precautions Compliance Scale total score of the participants was 71.92\u00b15.74. There was no significant difference in the mean Isolation Precautions Compliance Scale total scores of the participants based on their sociodemographic characteristics and isolation precautions. Conclusion: It was determined that the compliance of the intern nursing students, whose nursing labor could be needed in the COVID-19 pandemic period, with isolation precautions was on a good level.

    "title": "The Future of Work: Exploring the Post-Pandemic Workplace from an Employment Law and Human Resources Perspective",
    "abstract": "In March of 2017, when we were blissfully ignorant of what was to come in that same month a few years later, an associate professor of political science named Robert Kelly was being interviewed on BBC from his home office in South Korea. About a minute into the interview, his four year old daughter pranced into the room, in the most literal sense of the word, followed by her little brother in a baby walker and, shortly thereafter, Kelly\u2019s horrified spouse, Kim Jung-A, who scrambled to collect the kids and close the office door. \n \nThat viral BBC interview, which now has tens of millions of views on YouTube, took place long before our collective experiment in working from home. While Kelly\u2019s experience was truly novel in 2017, it feels like just another day at the office in 2020. If we have not personally had a kid \u201cbust down the door,\u201d as my toddlers like to say, during a Zoom call, then we have seen someone else\u2019s kid do the same. While Kelly\u2019s interview may have still gone viral if it had happened today\u2014this was live on BBC, after all\u2014the whole thing feels far more familiar than it once did. \n \nCOVID-19 has upended the workplace as we know it. Employment experts widely speculate that certain industries have fast-forwarded in the direction of working remotely by years. If the future of work for many employees is primarily virtual, what challenges does this entail for employers? What new rights might employees have coming out of the pandemic? In industries that continue operating in person, how should employers accommodate vulnerable employees who request to work remotely? What about non-vulnerable employees who are simply afraid to come in? \n \nWhile analyzing these and related questions, this article explores the arguments for and against remote work. It goes on to show that the \u201chybrid workplace,\u201d in which more people work from home more of the time, is our likely future. The article considers the new challenges this raises for employers and the new rights that it bestows on employees. The article concludes by arguing that giving employees choice about their work location is a mechanism for employers to avoid potential liability while boosting workplace morale and increasing productivity; creating a win-win for employees and employers alike.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the relationship between learning motivation and learning outcomes of students chemistry of grade XI-MNS (mathematics and natural science). The research design used was quantitative with a correlation approach. The population of this study was all students of class XI-MNS at state senior high school (SHS) 4 Pematangsiantar as many as 205 students for the 2019/2020 Academic Year. The sampling technique for this research was random sampling, which is a random sampling technique with a total sample of 40 students. The instrument used in the study was a non-test (questionnaire) of 20 questions to measure student learning motivation, but measuring chemistry learning outcomes was taken from the odd semester exam scores. The results showed that the percentage of high motivation was 20%, sufficient motivation was 50%, and low motivation was 30%. Student chemistry learning outcomes with a minimum score with a score of 41 and a maximum value with a score of 63 derived from the semester test scores that have been assessed by the field teacher. The correlation coefficient (r) in this study is 0.80 and the value of the coefficient of determination (r\u00b2) amounting to 0.63 which indicates that students' chemistry learning outcomes affect 63% changes in chemistry learning motivation. This results show that the relationship between learning motivation and learning outcomes of students chemistry of grade XI-MNS is very strong.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The Virtual CTSA Visiting Scholars Program allows KL2 scholars to serve as visiting professors at host CTSA consortium institutions. This program facilitates connections with faculty outside scholars home institutions, as well as fostering collaboration among different CTSA hubs. Stanford aimed to incorporate participants into its KL2 program. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Stanford is one of 57 host institutions for the Virtual CTSA Visiting Scholars Program. The program includes a virtual meeting between each participant and a chosen faculty at the host institution. Program participants also give a virtual Grand Rounds lecture, open to the entire CTSA consortium. As well as encouraging Spectrum KL2 Scholars to participate in the virtual exchange, the Spectrum KL2 program incorporated the visiting scholars into weekly activities over the course of 3 months. Visiting scholars were invited to participate virtually in KL2 educational sessions, which provide career development training and mentoring. As meetings transitioned to in-person, KL2 scholars were allowed to attend virtually when needed. Hybrid in-person sessions were also conducive to participation by visiting scholars. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Stanfords Spectrum KL2 program was virtual (Zoom) for academic year 2020-2021 and included 1:1 mentoring sessions, weekly career development seminars, and 1:1 peer virtual lunches to integrate the 9 junior faculty scholars. Visiting scholars joined the weekly Zoom meetings when their schedules allowed. KL2 faculty mentored visiting scholars for 3 months, exchanging ideas and forming collaborations. Each visiting participant was paired with a KL2 Scholar, who provided 1:1 peer mentorship. In addition, visiting scholars presented a work-in-progress seminar, to obtain feedback before the more formal Grand Rounds lecture. For academic year 2021-2022, Spectrum KL2 meetings include virtual and hybrid in-person sessions, allowing visiting scholars to join by Zoom during the 3-month virtual exchange program. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: What set Stanfords Virtual CTSA Visiting Scholars Program apart was faculty engagement and mentorship provided to visiting participants. By incorporating visiting scholars virtually into the ongoing KL2 education program, participants could engage fully with mentors and scholars, even surpassing opportunities of pre-pandemic on-site visits.",

    "title": "Proximity and Political Science: How Distance was Overcome (Partially) by COVID-19",
    "abstract": "DOI:10.1017/S1049096522000312 Akey enemy of understanding is isolation. Distancemakes itmore difficult to craft scholarly insights, to obtain feedback, and to share ideas with other scholars. Because of this, tight-knit communities have long demonstrated advantages in research and learning. In the current globalized world, distance remains a problem for scholars of the Asia\u2013Pacific region. In contrast to Europe and the Americas\u2014regions characterized by continents\u2014the Pacific is an ocean with a diverse set of nations, most of which exist separated from one another, on the rim. This physical geography complicates attempts to study and to communicate insights about regional affairs. Arguably, our understanding of the region is hampered by one of its most important attributes: the physical separation of its component nations. Cyberspace overcomes distance. Its most useful attribute is the ability to transmit ideas and images across space, linking individuals and groups\u2014especially in situations in which geographic separation is a significant impediment. Although they are a distant second-best to actually being in person, virtual meetings through cyberspace for some time have been an alternative or complement to conferences and talks at remote locations. They are most attractive where the physical movement of people is most difficult, such as in the Asia\u2013Pacific region. The Pacific International Politics Conference Online Seminar Series (PIPCOSS) is an online workshop designed to encompass the intellectual interests of international relations (IR) scholars based in or engaging with the Asia\u2013Pacific region. The series emerged in part from the annual meetings of the Pacific International Politics Conference (PIPC), which were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. PIPCOSS\u2019s audience consists mainly of PhD-holding academics, researchers, and political science students, including not only previous PIPC participants but also newcomers. Seminars last about an hour, with a short presentation from the author and formal comments from two discussants, followed by a general Q&A session. Authors are expected to circulate a draft paper to the discussants one week before the presentation. Since June 2020, we have held 38 meetings (as of the end of March 2022). The affiliated institutions of the presenters are located in Australia (four), Canada (one), China (two), Germany (one), Hong Kong (seven), India (one), Japan (four), Singapore (one), South Korea (one), Switzerland (one), Taiwan (one), the United Kingdom (one), and the United States (13). The size of the audience varies between 10 and 35 people, depending on the date and time of the sessions. Thursday and Friday sessions tend to draw a larger audience. Community building is one of the critical tasks for online workshops. We circulate information on upcoming talks, which includes the title of the presentation and author information, to the PIPC listserv and other country-based and IR listservs, about a week before and on the day of the presentation.We also encourage past participants to introduce PIPCOSS to colleagues and serve as discussants to stay connected and build a community. Ironically, the average number of participants was higher during the peak of the pandemic. As vaccinations mitigated the pandemic, institutions have begun in-person teaching, which imposes more time constraints on potential participants and discussants. Once inperson teaching is restored everywhere, wewill increase our efforts to expand the community by reaching out to scholars in countries that have not been included yet (e.g., Southeast Asian countries). If there is a greater demand to set a regular meeting day and time, we will consider doing so as well. In addition, we want to hold an online mixer to receive feedback from previous and potential participants about community building. The PIPCOSS steering committee, which is composed of six members diverse in terms of age, gender, and location, diligently addresses issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The committee works to create an environment in which people from different backgrounds feel comfortable participating. PIPCOSS reduces the barriers for participants from underrepresented groups in that workshop organizers are doing the legwork of networking for the presenter, who may not have the resources to reach out to higherprofile scholars or scholars in another country. PIPCOSS also gives priority to graduate students, who have had fewer opportunities to present their research due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, PIPCOSS sessions usually are held during Asian working hours while also being accessible for those joining from Europe and North America. This addresses issues of equity and inclusion for scholars who otherwise would find it difficult to participate due to their geographic location. Cross-border travel within the Asia\u2013Pacific region is costly because it usually is by air. Therefore, PIPCOSS enables intraregional inclusion by providing an easily accessible and friendly platform to exchange ideas for scholars in distant locations across the region. As vaccination rates increase and the pandemic gradually comes under control, it is important to consider how the community of Asia\u2013Pacific IR scholars can continue to benefit from our online presence and the creative adaptations it has made to date. Although there can be no replacement for in-person meetings, PIPCOSS and similar online seminar series have distinct advantages, three of which are cost, convenience, and reduced carbon footprint. Whereas many universities faced serious financial difficulties\u2014 or at least cost constraints\u2014during the pandemic, web-based meetings provided a lowor no-cost alternative to international travel. Even as our institutions recover financially in the coming years, the perennial challenge of managing what for many is the scarcest resource (i.e., time) will remain. Web-based research meetings are highly efficient in terms of time. We do not need to leave our desks to attend, different time zones usually can be accommodated, chat functions allow a parallel Q&A session that can be downloaded and saved after the meeting, and sessions can be recorded easily for viewing by those who cannot attend in real time. Many political scientists also are greatly concerned about climate change. Online meetings have proven to be a viable tool that has the potential to significantly reduce our collective carbon footprint. Those of us who travel frequently in the Asia\u2013Pacific region typically cover vast distances by air each year. For instance, a roundtrip Los Angeles to Seoul flight produces about 885 kg of carbon, according to the United Nation\u2019s International Civil Aviation Organization web calculator.1 Given the vastness of the",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Ozone depletion by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) was first proposed by Molina and Rowland in their 1974 Nature paper. Since that time, the scientific connection between ozone losses and CFCs and other ozone depleting substances (ODSs) has been firmly established with laboratory measurements, atmospheric observations, and modeling studies. This science research led to the implementation of international agreements that largely stopped the production of ODSs. In this study we use a fully-coupled radiation-chemical-dynamical model to simulate a future world where ODSs were never regulated and ODS production grew at an annual rate of 3%. In this \"world avoided\" simulation, 17% of the globally-averaged column ozone is destroyed by 2020, and 67% is destroyed by 2065 in comparison to 1980. Large ozone depletions in the polar region become year-round rather than just seasonal as is currently observed in the Antarctic ozone hole. Very large temperature decreases are observed in response to circulation changes and decreased shortwave radiation absorption by ozone. Ozone levels in the tropical lower stratosphere remain constant until about 2053 and then collapse to near zero by 2058 as a result of heterogeneous chemical processes (as currently observed in the Antarctic ozone hole). The tropical cooling that triggers the ozone collapse is caused by an increase of the tropical upwelling. In response to ozone changes, ultraviolet radiation increases, more than doubling the erythemal radiation in the northern summer midlatitudes by 2060.",

    "abstract": "Background: Over a year since the first reported case, COVID-19 burden in Ethiopia remains unknown due to limited surveillance. We aimed to investigate seroepidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 among frontline healthcare workers (HCW) and communities in Ethiopia. \n \nMethods: We conducted a population-based, prospective, longitudinal cohort study involving HCW, urban residents, and rural communities in Jimma and Addis Ababa. Serology was performed with Elecsys\u00ae Anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid assay (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) in three consecutive rounds with a mean interval of six weeks between tests to obtain seroprevalence and incidence estimates within the cohorts. \n \nFindings: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among HCW increased dramatically during the study period: in Addis Ababa from 10\u00b79% (95% Credible Interval: 8\u00b73%; 13\u00b78%) in August 2020 to 53\u00b77% (44\u00b78; 62\u00b75) in February 2021, incidence rate 2,223 (1,785; 2,696) per 100,000 person-weeks; in Jimma from 30\u00b78% (26\u00b79; 34\u00b78) in November 2020 to 56\u00b71% (51\u00b71; 61\u00b71) in February 2021, incidence rate 3,810 (3,149; 4,540) per 100,000 person-weeks. Among urban communities, an almost 40% increase in seroprevalence was observed in early 2021, with incidence rates of 1,622 (1,004; 2,429) in Jimma and 4,646 (2,797; 7,255) per 100,000 person-weeks in Addis Ababa.\u00a0 Seroprevalence in rural communities increased from 18\u00b70% (13\u00b75, 23\u00b72) in November 2020 to 31\u00b70% (22\u00b73, 40\u00b73) in March 2021. \n \nInterpretation: SARS-CoV-2 spread in Ethiopia has been highly dynamic among HCW and urban communities. It can be speculated that the greatest wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections is currently evolving in rural Ethiopia and thus requires focused attention in respect to healthcare burden and disease prevention. \n \nFunding Information: Bavarian State Ministry of Sciences, Research and the Arts (Bayerisches Staatsministerium, F.4-V0122.4/3/20), Germany Ministry of Education and Research (MoKoCo19; 01KI20271), EU Horizon2020 program (ORCHESTRA; 101016167), Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SEPAN; HA 7376/3-1), Volkswagenstiftung (E2; 99450). \n \nDeclaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests. \n \nEthics Approval Statement: This research was approved by the institutional review boards of (i) the Jimma University Institute of Health, (ii) St. Paul\u2019s Hospital Millennium Medical College, and (iii) Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.

    "title": "Ultrafast Science to Capture Ultrafast Motions",
    "abstract": "We are living in a dynamic world, where all matter is in a vibrant process, whether it is a giant celestial body or a small atom. Being able to observe, analyze, and manipulate these dynamic processes is undoubtedly essential for scientific discoveries and technical innovations. The evolution of any physical quantity (e.g., displacement, mass, electromagnetic fields, intensity, phase, and spectra) with time gives rise to different time-varying phenomena\u2014some are slow, some are fast, and some are ultrafast, in view of what human beings can sense. With the modern smartphone or camera, fast motions within the microsecond time scale can now be recorded in daily life. However, when we enter into the micro/nanoscale world, what happens often becomes ultrafast. For example, atomic diffusion occurs in a nanosecond (10\u20139s) time scale. Molecular rotation, charge transfer relaxation, and magnetization reversal happen in picoseconds (10\u201312s). Molecule and lattice vibrations can happen even faster, occurring in femtoseconds (10\u201315s). Looking into the depths of an atomic system, electrons move orders faster to the attosecond (10\u201318s), which is currently the fastest process that human beings can observe. Furthermore, when we explore the nucleus of an atom, we will find the ultrafast dynamics happening in zeptoseconds (10\u201321s). These ultrafast processes, which eventually govern the property of matter, need special pulsed probing sources, methods, and instruments to investigate. The related ultrafast technologies play important roles for research and applications in fundamental physics, chemistry, materials, biology, energy, and information science. \n \nUltrafast science is a general term referring to a knowledge system to investigate and explore the phenomena and laws of ultrafast changes in the universe. It involves various disciplines including atom and molecule physics, condensed matter physics, mechanics, optics, chemistry, biology, material science, and information science. Thus, ultrafast science has developed rapidly in the past decades. The Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded for femtosecond laser chemistry in 1999. The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for optical frequency comb laser precision spectroscopy in 2005. The 2018 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for ultrashort super-intense laser pulse technology\u2014chirped pulse amplification. In the last 10 years, over 50,000 research articles have been published in over 1,000 journals, as analyzed by Web of Science using the keyword of \u201cultrafast.\u201d However, there lacks a specific high-impact journal that focuses on ultrafast science. This is the motivation for launching the Ultrafast Science journal. After over 1 year of preparation and discussion with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), we reached a consensus that ultrafast science is an emerging and important direction which covers very broad and leading research fields. \n \nIn 2020, Ultrafast Science became a Science Partner Journal distributed by the AAAS in collaboration with Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics (XIOPM), which is one of the leading organizations in ultrafast science in China, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Ultrafast Science is an Open Access Journal which publishes top-quality original research articles, comprehensive reviews, and perspectives, reflecting significant advances, breakthroughs, and novel applications with considerable potential in ultrafast science and broad interest from scientific communities. Topics include but are not limited to ultrafast physics, ultrafast laser and application, ultrafast imaging, ultrafast spectroscopy, ultrafast measurement, ultrafast materials and devices, ultrafast terahertz photonics, ultrafast electronics, ultrafast chemical physics, and other ultrafast phenomena. Interdisciplinary research demonstrating how ultrafast technology advances physics, chemistry, biology, material science, and other disciplines is especially welcome. \n \nWe are honored to serve as the founding Editors-in-Chief and are grateful to work with the members of the Editorial Board, which currently comprise around 40 famous scientists from all over the world, including Gerard Mourou, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 2018. We believe that Ultrafast Science will become a high-impact journal in the near future with all of your participation and contributions, and that the journal will grow with the continuous breakthroughs in the ultrafast frontier.",

    "title": "How COVID-19 Affected the Journal Impact Factor of High Impact Medical Journals: Bibliometric Analysis",
    "abstract": "Background Journal impact factor (IF) is the leading method of scholarly assessment in today\u2019s research world, influencing where scholars submit their research and where funders distribute their resources. COVID-19, one of the most serious health crises, resulted in an unprecedented surge of publications across all areas of knowledge. An important question is whether COVID-19 affected the gold standard of scholarly assessment. Objective In this paper, we aimed to comprehensively compare the productivity trends of COVID-19 and non\u2013COVID-19 literature as well as track their evolution and scholarly impact across 3 consecutive calendar years. Methods We took as an example 6 high-impact medical journals (Annals of Internal Medicine [Annals], The British Medical Journal [The BMJ], Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA], The Lancet, Nature Medicine [NatMed], and The New England Journal of Medicine [NEJM]) and searched the literature using the Web of Science database for manuscripts published between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. To assess the effect of COVID-19 and non\u2013COVID-19 literature in their scholarly impact, we calculated their annual IFs and percentage changes. Thereafter, we estimated the citation probability of COVID-19 and non\u2013COVID-19 publications along with their rates of publication and citation by journal. Results A significant increase in IF change for manuscripts including COVID-19 published from 2019 to 2020 (P=.002; Annals: 283%; The BMJ: 199%; JAMA: 208%; The Lancet: 392%; NatMed: 111%; and NEJM: 196%) and to 2021 (P=.007; Annals: 41%; The BMJ: 90%; JAMA: 6%; The Lancet: 22%; NatMed: 53%; and NEJM: 72%) was seen, against non\u2013COVID-19 ones. The likelihood of highly cited publications was significantly increased in COVID-19 manuscripts between 2019 and 2021 (Annals: z=3.4, P<.001; The BMJ: z=4.0, P<.001; JAMA: z=3.8, P<.001; The Lancet: z=3.5, P<.001; NatMed: z=5.2, P<.001; and NEJM: z=4.7, P<.001). The publication and citation rates of COVID-19 publications followed a positive trajectory, as opposed to non\u2013COVID-19. The citation rate for COVID-19 publications peaked by the second quarter of 2020 while that of the publication rate approximately a year later. Conclusions The rapid surge of COVID-19 publications emphasized the capacity of scientific communities to respond against a global health emergency, yet inflated IFs create ambiguity as benchmark tools for assessing scholarly impact. The immediate implication is a loss in value of and trust in journal IFs as metrics of research and scientific rigor perceived by academia and society. Loss of confidence toward procedures employed by highly reputable publishers may incentivize authors to exploit the publication process by monopolizing their research on COVID-19 and encourage them to publish in journals of predatory behavior.",

    "title": "Reducing Bias in Wikipedia\u2019s Coverage of Political Scientists",
    "abstract": "One in five political scientists with biographies on Wikipedia are women and almost half are American. Biases onWikipedia can cause real harm, so I created or expanded a political science\u2013related Wikipedia article every day for a year, focusing on writing new pages about political scientists from underrepresented groups. This article shows that Wikipedia\u2019s coverage of political scientists remains skewed by gender and nationality, and I suggest ways for political scientists to improve Wikipedia\u2019s representation of the discipline. Anyone can write an article on Wikipedia, including a biography of another person, but an overwhelming proportion of these biographies are about men from wealthy countries. This has prompted a type of digital activism: for almost as long as Wikipedia has existed, there have been collective efforts to make its coverage of people fairer (Redden 2016).1 Almost a decade of work has focused specifically on increasing the proportion of biographies about women in science (Wade and Zaringhalam 2018). However, whereas thousands of new pages have been written about underrepresented natural scientists, medical researchers, and engineers, Wikipedia\u2019s treatment of social scientists has not received the same level of attention. Yet, Wikipedia\u2019s coverage of social sciences suffers from the same problems as its coverage of natural and medical sciences. Adams, Br\u00fcckner, and Naslund (2019) found that sociologists who are men or who are white are disproportionately likely to be the subject of a biography onWikipedia, and Schellekens, Holstege, and Yasseri (2019) identified similar gender gaps among pages about economists, physicists, and philosophers. As Alter et al. (2020) argued, and as Ackerly and Michelitch (2022) discuss in this symposium, there is reason to expect that these biases also would apply to political scientists. Tomatch the estimated proportion of women among full-time political scientists in the United States, Wikipedia\u2019s biographies of women in political science would need to appear at almost double the overall proportion of Wikipedia biographies about women (APSA 2011).2 These types of biases echo the enduring problems in political science. Gender gaps have been consistently identified in political science citations, syllabi, and books, whereas the academic study of politics historically has focused on a small number of wealthy countries (Dion and Mitchell 2019; Wilson and Knutsen 2020). The prominent initiativesWomen Also Know Stuff and People of Color Also Know Stuff were motivated partly by a closely related bias: publications and events about politics are less likely to include experts who are white women or people of color (Beaulieu et al. 2017; Lemi, Osorio, and Rush 2019). Like other types of bias in the discipline, biased coverage on Wikipedia can have serious effects. In a typical month, Wikipedia articles about politics are viewed hundreds of millions of times.3 Experiments demonstrate that text on highly viewed Wikipedia pages can affect outcomes from the way that scientific topics are described in academic papers to the revenue of tourist destinations (Hinnosaar et al. 2017; Thompson and Hanley 2018). Researchers specifically argue that biased coverage of a profession on Wikipedia can discourage people from joining that profession due to an absence of visible role models (Hinnosaar 2019; Wade and Zaringhalam 2018). To address these issues, I undertook a year-long project to reduce bias among political science\u2013relatedWikipedia articles, in which I focused on gender and regional disparities in biographies about political scientists. Every day in 2020, I created or expanded a Wikipedia article about a political scientist from an underrepresented group. How productive were these efforts, and how much work remains before Wikipedia biographies of political scientists are a fair representation of the field? First, I describe the distributions of gender and nationality among Wikipedia pages about political scientists. I then discuss the limitations of an individual effort like mine that aims to address a systemic problem. Finally, I provide concrete suggestions for how others can contribute.",

Examination of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including 64 patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes, was conducted on the basis of the pulmonology department of the Chernivtsi Regional Clinical Hospital in 2016-2020. Patients were divided into two groups \u2013 the main and the control. Patients with COPD with concomitant type 2 diabetes in the main group (49 patients) were prescribed atorvastatin at a dose of 20-40 mg once a day. The control group (15 COPD patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes) received essential treatment without atorvastatin. Patients received basic therapy depending on the group of patients (A, B, C and D) and the prevalence of shortness of breath or the frequency of exacerbations, long-acting bronchodilators (long-acting \u03b22-agonists and/or long-acting anticholinergic drugs). A separate group of patients received a combination of a long-acting \u03b22-agonist with an inhaled glucocorticosteroid. Some patients were prescribed roflumilast and antibactereal drugs from the group of macrolides (azithromycin or erythromycin). In the presence of sputum, patients were prescribed mucolytic drugs (Lazolvan, ACC, carbocisteine, erdosteine). In case of exacerbation, patients received a short course glucocorticosteroids parenterally, antibacterial drugs (for infectious exacerbation), nebulizer therapy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The effectiveness of therapy was evaluated after six months of treatment using the following diagnostic methods: clinical data (dyspnea, cough, sputum production - according to the BCSS scale; and shortness of breath, cough, sputum production and its color - according to the Paggiaro scale), the number of hospitalizations per year, the number emergency medical calls.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mathematical processing of the obtained data was carried out using programs BioStat 2009 Professional, version 5.8.4.3 (AnalystSoft Inc.), SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science Statistics) 16.0, Statistisa 10.0 StatSoft Inc., Microsoft Excel 2010. Before testing statistical hypotheses were determined coefficients of asymmetry and kurtosis using the Hahn-Shapiro-Wilkie test to analyze the normality of the distribution of values \u200b\u200bin randomized samples. \nResults. When analyzing clinical data in treatment dynamics with atorvastatin, it was found that according to the BCSS, shortness of breath in patients of the main group significantly decreased. Cough in COPD patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes treated with atorvastatin decreased by 25.3% at the end of treatment. A decrease in sputum production was observed in two groups of patients, and the changes were significant. Reduction of the frequency of exacerbations per year, the number of emergency calls, and the number of hospitalizations per year in the dynamics of atorvastatin treatment were also observed in COPD patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes. \nConclusion. the use of atorvastatin in the complex treatment of COPD patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes resulted in a decrease in the frequency of exacerbations per year, the number of emergency calls, and the number of hospital admissions per year.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Sigmoid colon volvulus is a medico-surgical emergency which represents a common cause of colonic occlusion, it is characterized by strangulation of the sigmoid loop around its meso colic axis producing low mechanical occlusion [1]. Apart from this form conventionally described, the volvulus of the sigmoid colon can occur along an organoaxial axis. This form has been highlighted in the literature thanks to the diagnostic contribution of multi-detector scanners [2]. Objective: To determine the hospital frequency of sigmoid colon volvulus; to write the clinical and para-clinical aspects of sigmoid colon volvulus; write down the different treatments used for the management of sigmoid colon volvulus. Material and methods: This was a retrospective and prospective study that took place from January 2008 to December 2020 in the General Surgery Department of Gabriel Tour\u00e9. The retrospective phase ran from January 2008 to December 2019 and the prospective phase from January 2020 to December 2020. Results: From January 2008 to December 2020, we collected 320 cases of patients operated on for sigmoid colon volvulus out of 7989 surgical emergencies over a 12-year period, or 3.64%. In our study, the most represented age group was between 16 and 60 years old, i.e. 81.88%. The mean age was 42.6 \u00b1 17.4 years with extremities of 16 and 90 years. The male sex was the most represented, 89% with a sex ratio of 8.41. The surgical history was found in 13.75% of our patients. The clinic was dominated by abdominal pain (100%), meteorism (100%), and gas and matter arrest (91.3%). The most common radiological image found in the ASP was the double jamb, i.e. 74.69% of cases. We found sigmoid necrosis in 18.13% of cases. We found an absence of necrosis in the majority of cases, i.e. How to cite this paper: Amadou, M., Ibrahima, D., Amadou, B., Boubacar, D.A., Bathio, T., Diassana, M., Yoro, S.B., Tani, K., Adama, D.A., Amadou, T., Zakari, S., Mamadou, D., Moussa, K., H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, S.O., Lassana, K., Madiassa, K., Souleymane, D., Moussa, S., Tientigui, D.B., Alhassane, T. and Ad\u00e9gn\u00e9, T.

    "title": "The Impact of Social Media on the Academic Life and Performance of High School Students in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "Social media has a vital part of an individual's life that allows people to communicate with one another. In recent days the prevalence of addiction to social media among students is a serious issue. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of social media on the academic life and performance of high school students in Saudi schools, in Eastern Province Saudi Arabia. This was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study conducted in a Saudi school over 3 months (Nov 2020 Jan 2021), where 203 high school students were participated in the study. Data collected from the questionnaire included the academic performance in terms of school marks, the duration of social media use, time spend for studying, and social media addiction. Data analysis was performed using a statistical package for social science version 26 (SPSS) was used. \u00a0Most of the participants were male students 131 (64%) and half of them 82 (40.4%) were in their academic second year. The mean time spent by students studying in a week was 18.50(M=18.50, SD = 8.33), while 3.79 mean hours per day were spent by students to use social media (M= 3.79, SD=2.65). A large majority of the participants using WhatsApp 191(94%) followed by snap chat 176 (86.7%).\u00a0 About 171 (84.2%) agreed that the time spend on social networks takes up their time for studying. Based on Internet distraction, 81.3% of the participants agreed that social network is the main reason for their distraction in studies. The time spend on studying per week were significantly associated with gender (P= 0.0001), age (P= 0.0001). Also there was significant difference between male and female in the final exam scoring (P= 0.0001). The results found that the use of social media among Saudi school students\u2019 found high. Additionally, findings reported that the use of social media has distracted students from studying.",

    "abstract": "After more than a year of a pandemic that forced educational institutions of all levels to make changes in teaching practice and continue with the teaching-learning process in a virtual way, the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed experience the needs or limitations of access to Internet connectivity, technological resources, management of digital tools and appropriate strategies; not only in teaching but also in student learning strategies. The following research objective was proposed: to determine the learning strategies used by University students in the time of COVID-19, in a Public University of Peru. A sample of 302 students from the 2020 academic period was considered, for which the ACRA-Abridged learning strategies instrument (ACRA-A) for university students from De la Fuente Arias et al was applied; 65% were students of Health Sciences and 35% students of Social Sciences and Humanities, comprised in two age groups: the Middle includes students from 16 to 19 years old and the Late group includes students from 20 years old and over. The 20% of the students in the area of Health Sciences and Social Sciences and Humanities used comprehension strategies and study habits in online learning, supported by technological resources, provided by the Integrated University Management System (SIGE) of the University.",

    "abstract": "Faculty learning communities (FLCs), established prepandemic to disseminate and discuss evidence-based teaching practices as part of an NSF-funded project, Investigating Student Success Using Evidence-Based Strategies-eXpanded (ISSUES-X), proved effective at facilitating learning during a pandemic. As our university made the decision to operate primarily online for the 2020-2021 academic year in response to COVID-19, the ninefacilitator ISSUES-X team supported faculty and their online teaching by offering weekly synchronous open-house video conferences and providing a one-week summer institute. The institute focused on applying principles of How People Learn (NRC, 1999) to the online environment, and intentionally modeled these pedagogical practices. Practices included: online approaches and tools to developing rapport with students;asynchronous reading and assignments sandwiched around synchronous active learning exercises over video conferencing;office hours and other support outside of regular meeting times;and routines for metacognitive reflection. Our pre-existing FLC structure allowed us to support many faculty during a time of crisis, illustrating the value of FLCs as a normative practice in academia.

    "title": "COVID-19 Border Restriction Reduced Dengue Transmission",
    "abstract": "Background: Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, China implemented strict border restrictions to prevent disease importation. Yunnan, a province of China that shares borders with dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue from 6840 cases in 2019 to 260 cases in 2020. Methods: By using a unique epidemiological and genomic dataset from 2013 to 2020 collected in Yunnan, we reconstruct the dynamics of DENV transboundary transmission and investigate the impact of border restriction on dengue expansion. Findings: Dengue transmission in Yunnan was strongly correlated with historical cases in border countries with a 2-3 months lag ( r = 0.58, P <0.01 with Laos;r = 0.55, P <0.01 with Thailand;r = 0.34, P <0.01 with Viet Nam), while the pattern vanished since the beginning of border restriction in 2020. Our analyses revealed multiple independent DENV transboundary introductions from endemic countries to Yunnan all year round, that likely triggered seasonal outbreaks of dengue in the summer when environmental conditions were suitable for mosquito vectors. This work suggests that Yunnan is a sink of DENV transmission and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting hundreds or thousands of cases. Interpretation: The study reveals that surveillance and management of human movement, particularly of travelers returning from high-risk areas could be an effective method to prevent dengue spread, provided other negative impacts of movement restrictions can be minimized.Funding Statement: Funding for this study was provided by Beijing Science and Technology Planning Project (Z201100005420010);Beijing Natural Science Foundation (JQ18025);Beijing Advanced Innovation Program for Land Surface Science;National Natural Science Foundation of China (82073616);Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST (YESS) (2018QNRC001);H.T. and M.U.G.K. acknowledge support from the Oxford Martin School.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests.",

    "title": "Levels and Correlates of Objectively Measured Sedentary Behaviour\u00a0In Young Children: Sunrise Pilot Study Results from 19 Countries",
    "abstract": "Background: There is a paucity of data from low- and middle-income countries on sedentary behaviour (SB) levels and patterns during early childhood. The purpose of this study was to examine how device-measured SB in young children differed across geographically, economically, and socio-demographically diverse populations, in an international sample. \n \nMethods: This multinational, cross-sectional pilot study included data from 1071 3\u20135-year-old children from 19 countries, collected between 2018 and 2020 (pre-COIVID). SB was measured for three consecutive days using activPAL accelerometers. Sedentary time, sedentary fragmentation and seated transport duration were calculated using PAL Analysis Algorithms and a custom-made analysis program. Linear mixed models were used to examine the differences in SB variables between sex, country-level income groups, caregiver education levels, urban/rural settings, and population density. \n \nFindings: Children spent 56% (7.4 hrs) of their waking time sedentary, and 42% accrued at least one sedentary bout/day lasting \u226560 min. The longest average bout duration was 81.1\u00b145.4 min, and an average of 61.1\u00b150.1 min/day was spent in seated transport. Children from upper-middle-income and high-income countries spent a greater proportion of the day sedentary, accrued more sedentary bouts, had shorter breaks between sedentary bouts, and spent significantly more time in seated transport, than children from low- and lower-middle-income countries. Few differences were found in SB patterns between urban/rural settings and caregiver education levels within each country-level income group, while multiple significant differences were found when comparing between country-level income groups. Higher population density was correlated with several higher SB measures. \n \nInterpretation: These data advance our understanding of young children\u2019s SB patterns globally and the influences of country income, urban/rural setting, caregiver education levels, and population density. Country income levels and population density appear to be stronger drivers of the observed differences, than sex, rural or urban residential setting or caregiver educational attainment. \n \nFunding: American Council on Exercise, USA Beijing Health System High Level Talents Training Project, China 13 Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh Canadian Institutes of Health Research Planning and Dissemination Grant Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq Research Department of National Planning and Monitoring, PNG Government Early Start, University of Wollongong, Australia Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa Global Challenges Program, University of Wollongong, Australia Harry Crossley Foundation, South Africa National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia NIH - International Research Training Grant Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, Vietnam Research University Grant (GUP), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Sasakawa Sports Research Grant, Sasakawa Sports Foundation, Japan Stella de Silva Research Grant, Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians, Sri Lanka The DST-NRF Centre for Excellence in Human Development at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa The International Society of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, Pioneers Program \n \nDeclaration of Interest: The authors have no competing financial or personal interests to declare. \n \nEthical Approval: Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Wollongong, Australia (ref: 2018/044) and the appropriate ethics committee(s) in each country.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Orthognathic surgery has become increasingly accepted as a method of correcting moderate to severe Class III skeletal deformities. The recognition of aesthetic factors and the prediction of the final facial profile play a very important role in the planning of surgical therapy because the majority of patients are generally very sensitive to any changes in facial aesthetics after orthognathic surgery. Objective Evaluate soft tissue changes (Nose, lips and chin) in relation to the underlying hard tissue movements, and surgical changes after different surgical approaches, designed to treat Class III skeletal malocclusions, including different types of two-dimensional analysis and also threedimensional analysis. Materials We adopted a research strategy based on a query of five digital bibliographic databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library over a 13-year period from 2007 to 2020. We limited our research by using several keywords according to the following search equation: orthognathic surgery/skeletal class III/soft tissue/changes. In addition, no exclusion of articles based on language was made. Results Orthognathic surgery in class III skeletal cases causes quite considerable changes in the facial profile and also in the overlying soft tissues, in the anterior-posterior and transverse direction.

    "abstract": "Background: Ganglion cyst is the most common soft tissue tumour of the hand. 60-70 % are present on dorsal aspect of wrist. They may affect any age group, however they are more common in 20s-40s. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, history of trauma is seen in 10% of cases. These cysts are filled with fluids, and most often, they appear and disappear very quickly and majority of them do not require treatment unless the cyst is painful, alters function of the wrist or deformed appearance Aims and Objectives: To study the size of ganglion cyst, symptoms at presentation, management done and outcomes. Materials and Methods: A Retrospective analysis of all the cases of dorsal wrist ganglion presented to Surgical OPD over a period of 1 year, June 2020 to may 2021 at Maharajah\u2019s Institute of Medical Sciences,, Vizianagaram and in them dorsal wrist ganglion cases were studied with respect to the size of the cyst, Symptoms at presentation, management done and outcomes. Results: Total of 94 cases have been presented to Surgical OPD. Of it 60% cases are of size greater 2cm. Symptoms: 14 cases presented with pain, 6 cases presented with tingling sensation others for cosmetic appearance and apprehension of tumour. Management: wait & watch(observation) for 36 cases of size less than 1cm; Immobilization (wrist brace or splint) for 8 cases which are arising from wrist joint; Aspiration &steroid injection(triamcelone) for 35 cases; Surgical excision for 15 cases which were recurrences from previous management and painful cases. Outcome: recurrence is the most common complication. Success by surgical excision was 86% and aspiration &steroid injection was 75%. Conclusion: Recurrence after management was the most common complication of dorsal wrist ganglions. Surgical excision is the most successful form of treatment followed by aspiration &steroid injection into the ganglion.",

    "title": "A New Start: Two Metres at a Time",
    "abstract": "There are a number of points in the year that are considered \u201cnew\u201d starts. The one that I find the most exciting is the new start in September (in some jurisdictions, the start to the new school year is in August or January, but they are all exciting to me). At this time of year, there is a great potential for new experiences. The newness exists everywhere: the students in our courses, the courses that we teach, our roles within education, our research questions, and new writing projects. The 21.3 issue of CJSMTE is also celebrating new and old becoming new. We have restarted the Newsround feature in the journal. This was a feature that appeared during the early inception years of the journal as a way to share news and happenings in the SMT community. After reflections from previous editors (Blades, 2020) and discussions with the editors, we have included this again. Dr. Alexandre Cavalcante of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto is the editor of the Newsround. His inaugural column appears in this issue. There is also a new feature called the Canadian Mathematics Education Matters by Math Editor Egan Chernoff. In his first article, \u201cThe Metre as a Metric: Canada\u2019s COVID-19 Conversion Kerfuffle\u201d, he provides a humourous account of his observations of signs that equate six feet and two metres to describe the social distancing requirements of governments and organizations (Chernoff, 2021). He documents, in written and pictorial form, the poor presentation of the metric system in Canada during the COVID-19 global pandemic. One of the themes in this issue is the creation and use of science textbooks. Kim et al. (2021) interview Canadian science textbook authors to better understand their hopes for textbooks and some of the challenges they encountered. The textbook authors explained how difficult it was to address social issues in their books due to resistance from science teachers. One of their primary hopes was for teachers to develop and use alternate materials, including textbooks, to engage in discussions about socioenvironmental issues, rather than rely solely on science textbooks. Kim et al. (2021) suggest that it is very difficult to shift the discourse of scientific literacy in textbooks, but they are left with a sense of hope of human agency to make some changes.",

    "title": "Levels and Correlates of Objectively Measured Sedentary Behaviour\u00a0In Young Children: Sunrise Pilot Study Results from 19 Countries",
    "abstract": "Background: There is a paucity of data from low- and middle-income countries on sedentary behaviour (SB) levels and patterns during early childhood. The purpose of this study was to examine how device-measured SB in young children differed across geographically, economically, and socio-demographically diverse populations, in an international sample. \n \nMethods: This multinational, cross-sectional pilot study included data from 1071 3\u20135-year-old children from 19 countries, collected between 2018 and 2020 (pre-COIVID). SB was measured for three consecutive days using activPAL accelerometers. Sedentary time, sedentary fragmentation and seated transport duration were calculated using PAL Analysis Algorithms and a custom-made analysis program. Linear mixed models were used to examine the differences in SB variables between sex, country-level income groups, caregiver education levels, urban/rural settings, and population density. \n \nFindings: Children spent 56% (7.4 hrs) of their waking time sedentary, and 42% accrued at least one sedentary bout/day lasting \u226560 min. The longest average bout duration was 81.1\u00b145.4 min, and an average of 61.1\u00b150.1 min/day was spent in seated transport. Children from upper-middle-income and high-income countries spent a greater proportion of the day sedentary, accrued more sedentary bouts, had shorter breaks between sedentary bouts, and spent significantly more time in seated transport, than children from low- and lower-middle-income countries. Few differences were found in SB patterns between urban/rural settings and caregiver education levels within each country-level income group, while multiple significant differences were found when comparing between country-level income groups. Higher population density was correlated with several higher SB measures. \n \nInterpretation: These data advance our understanding of young children\u2019s SB patterns globally and the influences of country income, urban/rural setting, caregiver education levels, and population density. Country income levels and population density appear to be stronger drivers of the observed differences, than sex, rural or urban residential setting or caregiver educational attainment. \n \nFunding: American Council on Exercise, USA Beijing Health System High Level Talents Training Project, China 13 Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh Canadian Institutes of Health Research Planning and Dissemination Grant Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq Research Department of National Planning and Monitoring, PNG Government Early Start, University of Wollongong, Australia Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa Global Challenges Program, University of Wollongong, Australia Harry Crossley Foundation, South Africa National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia NIH - International Research Training Grant Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, Vietnam Research University Grant (GUP), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Sasakawa Sports Research Grant, Sasakawa Sports Foundation, Japan Stella de Silva Research Grant, Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians, Sri Lanka The DST-NRF Centre for Excellence in Human Development at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa The International Society of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, Pioneers Program \n \nDeclaration of Interest: The authors have no competing financial or personal interests to declare. \n \nEthical Approval: Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Wollongong, Australia (ref: 2018/044) and the appropriate ethics committee(s) in each country.",

    "title": "Incidence and Mortality in Emergency Patients Transported by Emergency-Medical-Service Personnel During the First Surge COVID-19 Pandemic in Osaka Prefecture, Japan; A Population-Based Study",
    "abstract": "Background: Novel corona virus (COVID-19) outbreaks have spread worldwide. Although the COVID-19 pandemic affects the emergency medical service (EMS) system, which is one factor of primary care, little is known about its impact. This study aimed to reveal the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the EMS system and outcome of emergency patients transported by ambulance in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. \n \nMethods: This was a retrospective study with a study period from 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. We included patients transported by ambulance who were registered in a population-based registry of emergency patients transported by ambulance. The primary endpoints of this study were the incident number of patients transported by ambulance each month and the number of deaths among emergency patients admitted to hospital each month. We calculated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a Poisson regression model with year 2019 as the reference. \n \nFindings: From January to May 2019, 205,195 patients were transported, whereas from January to May 2020, 180,362 patients were transported, indicating a significant decrease in the number of emergency patients transported by ambulance (IRR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.87\u20130.88). The number of deaths among emergency patients admitted to hospital was 5237 in January-May 2019 and remained unchanged at 5172 in January-May 2020 (IRR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.95\u20131.03). \n \nInterpretation: The first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic had no adverse effect on the EMS system in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. \n \nFunding: Japanese Society of the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (grant no. JP18H02902). \n \nDeclaration of Interests: All authors of this manuscript declared that they have no conflicts of interest that relate to the content of this manuscript. \n \nEthics Approval Statement: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine (approval no. 15003).",

    "abstract": "Faculty learning communities (FLCs), established prepandemic to disseminate and discuss evidence-based teaching practices as part of an NSF-funded project, Investigating Student Success Using Evidence-Based Strategies-eXpanded (ISSUES-X), proved effective at facilitating learning during a pandemic. As our university made the decision to operate primarily online for the 2020-2021 academic year in response to COVID-19, the ninefacilitator ISSUES-X team supported faculty and their online teaching by offering weekly synchronous open-house video conferences and providing a one-week summer institute. The institute focused on applying principles of How People Learn (NRC, 1999) to the online environment, and intentionally modeled these pedagogical practices. Practices included: online approaches and tools to developing rapport with students;asynchronous reading and assignments sandwiched around synchronous active learning exercises over video conferencing;office hours and other support outside of regular meeting times;and routines for metacognitive reflection. Our pre-existing FLC structure allowed us to support many faculty during a time of crisis, illustrating the value of FLCs as a normative practice in academia.

    "abstract": "Preface/Introduction With great pleasure, we would like to present to you the scholarly selected articles presented in the Regional Conference in Civil Engineering and Sustainable Development Goals in Higher Education Institutions 2020 (RCCE 2020), held between 23 rd and 24 th January 2021 conducted virtually via Whova Virtual Conference Platform in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia. This conference was sponsored by ASEAN Universiti Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-NET) under the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Technical Cooperation Project. RCCE 2020 strategized to combine the transformation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) implementation in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) based on the requirements of United Nation for the year 2030 as well as to support the specific agenda in \u201cThe World in 2050\u201d (TWI 2050). This aspiration was the global research and fact-based knowledge in transforming the indicated SDGs in a better way. Therefore, all the keynotes/ invited/ guest speakers explained their roles and contribution to the society, with SDGs related to R&D, innovation, technology and knowledge-transfer. Most of the issues and challenges were connected to the environmental application thereby strengthening the interaction between HEIs, Industry, Government and Community. As the world is still bound to the COVID-19 pandemic, travelling was restricted. For this, different parallel sessions were conducted virtually focusing on the theme \u201cLocalizing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Engineering with Look East Policy Partnership\u201d. Participants around this region did not only share similar issues or problems faced but also forged strong partnership among the ASEAN countries to come out with viable solutions fitting this region. In line with the international publication requirements, manuscripts from sessions related to engineering field including structural, environmental, material science, green technology, geotechnical, transportation, water resources and wastewater were rigorously reviewed. We hope that the collection of accepted manuscript will provide insights to many academicians, researchers and specialist of particular field.

    "title": "Modeling the Impact and Costs of Semiannual Mass Drug Administration for Accelerated Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis",
    "abstract": "The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) has a target date of 2020. This program is progressing well in many countries. However, progress has been slow in some countries, and others have not yet started their mass drug administration (MDA) programs. Acceleration is needed. We studied how increasing MDA frequency from once to twice per year would affect program duration and costs by using computer simulation modeling and cost projections. We used the LYMFASIM simulation model to estimate how many annual or semiannual MDA rounds would be required to eliminate LF for Indian and West African scenarios with varied pre-control endemicity and coverage levels. Results were used to estimate total program costs assuming a target population of 100,000 eligibles, a 3% discount rate, and not counting the costs of donated drugs. A sensitivity analysis was done to investigate the robustness of these results with varied assumptions for key parameters. Model predictions suggested that semiannual MDA will require the same number of MDA rounds to achieve LF elimination as annual MDA in most scenarios. Thus semiannual MDA programs should achieve this goal in half of the time required for annual programs. Due to efficiency gains, total program costs for semiannual MDA programs are projected to be lower than those for annual MDA programs in most scenarios. A sensitivity analysis showed that this conclusion is robust. Semiannual MDA is likely to shorten the time and lower the cost required for LF elimination in countries where it can be implemented. This strategy may improve prospects for global elimination of LF by the target year 2020.",

    "abstract": "Adolescents are included in the high-risk age group. Increased free sex behavior in adolescents has an impact on sexual and reproductive health problems. This phenomenon is supported by the increasing number of sexually transmitted diseases in adolescents. Several programs and policies have been adopted to improve adolescent reproductive health through coaching and counseling. Adolescents have confidence in their peers so peer education is an alternative intervention in increasing awareness of reproductive health. This study aims to comprehensively analyze research articles that discuss the effectiveness of peer education on knowledge and attitudes about sexual behavior in adolescents. The research design uses a literature review through the journal databases PubMed, Science Direct, and EBSCO. Researchers analyzed 18 research articles based on the inclusion criteria set, namely the time of publication in the 2015-2020 range, using English, being accessible for free, and teenage respondents. The exclusion criteria consisted of married adolescent respondents and adolescent sexual violence behavior. Keywords using peer education, knowledge, attitude, sexual behavior. Data analyzed using a table containing the author, year, method, sample, and research results. The results of the analysis of research articles show that peer education is a preventive and promotive effort in increasing knowledge and attitudes about sexual behavior in adolescents. The role of peers is an important component in this health education model. This model can be integrated and modified in adolescent reproductive health services in health care facilities.",

    "abstract": "Brinjal or eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) is one of the most important cultivated solanaceous vegetable, mainly grown for its edible fruits. The present investigation was carried out in order to obtained per se performance of parents and their cross combinations for genetic improvement in brinjal. Ten parents were crossed in diallel fashion excluding reciprocal. Half diallel set of crosses and their all possible 45 F1\u2019s (excluding reciprocals) in brinjal (Solanum melongena L.)were evaluated in Randomized Complete Block Design (RBD) with three replications for nineteen yield and yield contributing traits during Kharif 2020-21 (Y1) and 2021-22 (Y2) at the Main Experiment Station (MES) of Department of Vegetable Science, Acharya Narendra Deva University of Agriculture and Technology, Narendra Nagar, Kumarganj, Ayodhya (U.P.) India. The study revealed that highly significant differences were observed for most of the traits under study. Based on the per se performance, the parentP9 (2.61 kg) registered highest fruit yield per plant followed by P7 (2.49 kg) in both the year and pooled. The per se performance of crosses viz., P2 x P9 (3.11 kg), P4 x P6(2.66 kg), P1 x P8(2.55 kg)and P6 x P7(2.42 kg) were produced significantly highest fruit yield per plant than the general mean. These hybrids may be subjected to multi-locational and multi-seasonal trials for their release for commercial cultivation. The findings with respect to salinity tolerance must be correlated to develop the salt tolerant cultivars.",

    "title": "Antibiotic stewardship should consider environmental fate of antibiotics.",
    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are a significant public health issue, and contribute to at least 23 000 deaths and at least 2 million serious illnesses in the U.S. each year. In March 2015 the White House released the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, which was developed in response to an Executive Order on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria issued by President Barack Obama. The National Action Plan addresses policy recommendations contained in a recent Report to the President on Combating Antibiotic Resistance prepared by the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). The National Action Plan seeks to address the challenge of antibiotic resistance through enhanced surveillance, improved international collaborations, the development of new antibiotics, and improved antibiotic stewardship. The PCAST report defines antibiotic stewardship as \u201cefforts to optimize the use of antibiotics\u201d and presents strategies to improve antibiotic stewardship in human health care and animal agriculture. We note, however, that the National Action Plan and the PCAST report do not include the environmental fate of antibiotics as a component of antibiotic stewardship, nor do they address the increasing concentrations of antibiotics in U.S. surface waters as a potential contributing factor to the rise in antibiotic resistance. As more evidence continues to mount that antibiotics in the environment may be contributing to the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant microbes, we propose that the environmental fate of antibiotics should be a key component of a national strategy to improve antibiotic stewardship. The use of antibiotics in livestock has been recognized as contributing to the release of antibiotics to the environment, and the National Action Plan does propose to \u201celiminate the use of medically-important antibiotics for growth promotion in food-producing animals and bring other agricultural uses of antibiotics\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 under veterinary oversight\u201d. This proposal should help to reduce antibiotic release from agriculture. However, a less well recognized issue, which was not mentioned in the National Action Plan or the PCAST report, is the contribution of our nation\u2019s deteriorating sewage infrastructure to the environmental release of antibiotics. We propose that addressing this deteriorating infrastructure should be an explicit part of a national strategy for antibiotic stewardship. Although we focus herein on conditions in the U.S., the principle that environmental fate should be a component of antibiotic stewardship is relevant throughout the world. More than 250 million antibiotic prescriptions are written in the U.S. each year, and antibiotics are not entirely processed via human metabolism. This results in the release of antibiotics in human waste, and research presented in ES&T has documented the presence of antibiotics in wastewater throughout the world. In the U.S., many consumers also dispose of unwanted or expired medications by flushing them down the toilet, despite advice to the contrary. Thus, antibiotics end up in wastewater, and in the US 32 billion gallons of this wastewater flows through 700 000 miles of underground pipes and canals to treatment plants each day. Unfortunately, not all of this sewage reaches its intended destination. In the U.S., much of the network of sewage pipes was installed just after World War II, some as far back as the late 1800s. These pipes are showing signs of age, and many are leaking. The American Society of Civil Engineers recently gave the U.S. sewage infrastructure a grade of \u201cD\u201d. The EPA has projected that the percentage of U.S. wastewater pipes in \u201cpoor,\u201d \u201cvery poor,\u201d or \u201clife-elapsed\u201d conditions will increase from 23% in 2000 to 45% in 2020. In the U.S., an estimated 900 billion gallons of sewage is released into the nation\u2019s rivers and streams each year via infrastructure leaks or combined sewage overflows. Due to a variety of factors, including antibiotic use in agriculture and antibiotic release via treated wastewater effluent or unintentional release via failing infrastructure, antibiotics are present in surface waters throughout the U.S. The abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria as well as the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes have been linked to the presence of",

    "abstract": "The First2 Club at Fairmont State University started a peer-tutoring program during the 2020/2021 academic year to help support STEM and under-represented students by offering free and personalized tutoring. This tutoring initiative currently has four tutors. The student tutors range from sophomore to senior and are all Natural Science majors. The tutors have set tutoring dates and appointments available to meet with students. Most tutoring is one-on-one, but can also be in a group setting. After the meetings, students complete a survey. Preliminary results show 73 tutoring sessions in chemistry, biology, and physics courses. These courses tend to be the courses with the highest turn-over rate. Students tutored met the following demographics: female, first-generation, LGBTQ, minority, and male. Thus far the peer-tutoring program has been successful in reaching underrepresented students in STEM courses in the hope to increase the pass rate. Results of grade increase have not been assessed.",

We formulated seasonal upper and lower limits for NDVI and a target growth volume for rice yields of 700 g/m. A high positive exponential correlation was observed between NDVI and growth volume (plant length\u00d7number of tillers\u00d7leaf color value). The correlation can be expressed by a single exponential formula, regardless of growth stage year. Topdressing based on growth diagnosis by NDVI ensured a target panicle number and leaf colors for two years. Growth diagnosis by NDVI demonstrated high yield levels of 700 g/m over two years in various weather conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the GreenSeeker handheld crop sensor is useful in diagnosing the growth of stable, high-yielding rice.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, we began developing software components for an Application Programming Interface (API)-based integration architecture (the \u201cSpecify Network\u201d) to leverage the global footprint of the Specify 7 collections management platform (www.specifysoftware.org) and the analytical services of the Lifemapper (lifemapper.org) and Biotaphy (biotaphy.org) Projects. The University of Kansas Lifemapper Project is a community gateway for species distribution and macroecological modeling. The Biotaphy Project, an extension of Lifemapper, is the product of a six-year, U.S. National Science Foundation-funded collaboration among researchers at the Universities of Michigan, Florida, and Kansas. Biotaphy's primary scope is to use big data methods and high-performance computing to integrate species occurrence data with phylogenetic and biogeographic data sets for large taxonomic and spatial scale analyses. Our initial integrations between Biotaphy and the Specify Network enable Specify users to easily discover remote information related to the specimens in their collection. \n The widely-discussed, digital specimen architecture being championed by DiSSCo (Distributed System of Scientific Collections www.dissco.eu) and others (https://bit.ly/3jfsAgz) will change data communications between biodiversity collections and the broader biodiversity data community. Those network interactions will evolve from being predominantly one-way, batch-oriented transfers of information from museums to aggregators, to an n-way communications topology that will make specimen record discovery, updates and usage much easier to accomplish. But museum specimens and their catalogs will no longer be an intellectual endpoint of species documentation. Rather, records in collections management systems will increasingly serve as a point of departure for data synthesis, which takes place outside of institutional data domains, and which will overlay the legacy role of museums as authoritative sources of information about the diversity and distribution of life on Earth. Biological museum institutions will continue to play a vital role as the foundation of a global data infrastructure connecting aggregators, collaborative databases, analysis engines, journal publishers, and data set archives.\n In this presentation, we will provide an update on the components and capabilities that make up integrations in the Specify Network as an exemplar of the global architecture envisaged by the biodiversity research community.",

    "title": "Desk Rejecting \u201cAgainst Desk Rejects!\u201d",
    "abstract": "In \u201cAgainst Desk Rejects!,\u201d Jim Gibson lays out a passionate case for why he believes desk rejections are a perversion of the double-blind peer-review process and serve to hamper scholars.1 He also describes a set of reforms that he argues would solve the issue of the increase inmanuscript submissions without editors resorting to desk rejections. As coeditors of State Politics and Policy Quarterly (SPPQ) from 2014 to 2020, we confess to having used desk rejections on occasion. In fact, we did so even though we were not burdened by a large number of submissions; we received only about 110 each year. So, why didwe do it?Whynot simply send out everything for review? Simply stated, desk rejections are an important part of the review process, and depriving editors of this important tool significantly hampers their ability to shape the direction of the journal. This article explains the reason why desk rejects, although disappointing for authors, do not constitute a significant problem in political science. For the purposes of our argument, we concede Gibson\u2019s point that desk rejections have been increasing. However, to be fair, it is not clear to us that this is the case. Certainly, we have anecdotal evidence, but Gibson\u2019s article has not provided any systematic evidence in support of his claim. We do agree that there certainly is a perception among academics that desk rejections are increasing and that this is unfair to authors. To some extent, perception is reality.2 So, assuming that this behavior has increased, why is it not a problem? To begin, it is helpful to understand how someone becomes an editor. At almost all (if not all) journals in the discipline, the owner (i.e., either a professional association or a publisher) solicits applications from interested parties. It also is common for search committees to solicit applications. That is how we decided to apply to become editors of SPPQ; there was a call for proposals but we also were asked personally to apply. This is done to ensure a variety of applications, and it also makes people think about becoming an editor\u2014it would not occur to some that they would be good at it or that they would have a chance to be named editor. This is particularly true for scholars from underrepresented groups or those at less prestigious universities. It also is worth noting that being an editor, even at a small journal, is a time-consuming job that requires both organizational skills and sound judgment. As part of the application process, prospective editors must lay out their vision statement. That is, what do they want to focus on during their tenure as editors? We had four primary goals: (1) increase the visibility of the journal via social media; (2) institutionalize the data-verification process; (3) continue to increase submissions by seeking papers at conferences and encouraging people to submit; and (4) increase the number of papers submitted (and published) that focused on subnational politics in other countries. By accomplishing these goals, we thought we could raise the impact factor of the journal and make it a more desirable place for authors to publish. Other people who applied to be editor laid out their vision for the journal. Althoughwe did not say anything about desk rejects in our statement, we certainly could have stated that to preserve reviewers and expedite time to decision (an important factor that scholars consider when deciding where to submit), we were going to increase desk rejections for manuscripts that we did not think would survive the peer-review process for any reason (e.g., poor quality or poor fit). The point of describing the editor-selection process is that editors are not simply selected randomly; rather, they must lay out their vision and then their peers decide if that is the direction they want for the journal. Moreover, it is not always the people with the best scholarly records or from the most prestigious institutions who are selected. Indeed, the \u201cvision statement\u201d is crucial to the process.3 Given that we require editors to give careful thought about how they would run the journal, we should allow them to enact their vision once selected. If we said that we wanted to increase desk rejections by, say, 25%, the State Politics Section, which appointed us, should expect that that is what we would do. As anyone who has led an editor search knows, it is difficult to attract people to edit journals; it takes considerable time, and that time inevitably slows down our own research agenda. If we do not allow editors to shape the journal, we likely will have even fewer people willing to assume this important job. More important, this level of influence is not held solely in the decision of whether or not to desk reject. Editors select reviewers and make decisions when reviews come back. They give authors guidance on which parts of the reviews are most important to consider. Those choices are based on whose views the editors think are most relevant to the paper in question. If we receive a review that states our paper is \u201ctoo narrow\u201d for the journal in question, there is a good chance that the editor also thinks it is too narrow, which explains why the editor thinks that reviewer is a good choice. If we think a paper on procedural justice is too narrow for our journal, we are",

    "abstract": "I began to write this editorial as global COVID-19 cases had risen for over nine consecutive weeks, and as regions around the globe were experiencing second and even third waves, with over 3 million deaths world-wide (WHO, 4 May 2021). As this issue of CSSE is going to press, cumulative deaths attributed to COVID-19 have now surpassed 4 million, with 3 million new cases having been reported globally this week alone (WHO, 13 July 2021). These are staggering statistics, hinting at some of the wide-ranging human and societal costs associated with the pandemic, with a disproportionate impact on those already experiencing inequalities (Pirtle 2020). The process of education has become centered around remote teaching, learning and working from home over the past year, with drastic and unplanned changes to educational systems impacting over 94% of the world\u2019s student population (Pokhrell and Chettri 2021). Most of the international science education community has faced disruptions and upheavals due to COVID19. Our collective lives on campuses and in classrooms were abruptly halted, and many found themselves suddenly faced with the need to balance changing structures and roles both at home and at work. University learning quickly \u201cwent remote\u201d and faculty focused on the time-consuming process of converting courses that were once taught in person into online formats. Shifting responsibilities and restructured time commitments coupled with the challenges of uncertainty ushered in profound implications for the educational research community. While coping with unexpected responsibilities and new personal and professional roles in response to the pandemic, research productivity was challenged, especially for early career scholars, doctoral students and scholars of color (Levine et al. 2021). Many academics struggled with increasing obligations, and with finding time and space for research and writing, and all this at a time of crisis. Female academics are particularly at risk (Peters 2020), with recent journal publication trends already showing a decrease in representation of women scholars since the start of the pandemic (e.g., Pinho-Gomes et al. 2020). This raises the possibility of a frightening lack of diversity in the voices that are heard in future research literature. With ideologies that emphasize individual attainment shaping education systems, and a pervasive underpinning assumption that \u201cgoing remote\u201d is a simple shift in modality for information delivery with little other implications, this is a time of great concern for",

    "abstract": "Work as a lecturer is highly risk because of the workload, stress and unhealthy eating patterns or lifestyles as well as levels of welfare that are not proportional to performance demands. Recently, there has been an increasing number of premature deaths due to non-communicable or degenerative diseases. The research objective was to determine the characteristics and causes of death among lecturers in Jambi (case study at Jambi University). The research design was cross sectional. Data collection by interview and documentation in the staffing section and the family of lecturers who died. Data collection time for 2 months (July-August 2020). The number of lecturers who died during 2015-2020 was 25 people (2.5%). The average number of lecturers who died was 5 people/year. Characteristics of Lecturers who died were mostly male (76%), with an average age of 59.8 years (minimum 37 and maximum 68 years). The average working period is 30.64 years (minimum 13 and maximum 39 years). Lecturers pass away at the elderly (68%), associate Professor position (56%), work period of more than 30 years (64%), postgraduate education (64%), Bachelor of Law study program (20%), Faculty of Teacher Training and Science Education (40%), occurred most in 2018 (28%). The cause of death was non-communicable diseases (96%), especially Diabetes Mellitus (28%), Heart Attack, Hypertension, Liver Cancer and Auto Immune diseases. Non-communicable diseases as the main cause of death among lecturers, it is more often in women, doctoral education level, a functional position as a Professor, a work period of more than 30 years and from the Faculty of Social Humanities Literacy. It is necessary to prevent non-communicable diseases by implementing \u201cCERDIK\u201d behavior (regular health checks, no smoking, being active in physical activity/sports, a balanced diet, adequate rest and good stress management).",

    "abstract": "By the year 2020, the environmental movement will have established a recognized profession, expert at studying deleterious effects in the working and public domains. Environmental science practitioners will be better able to identify and relate ill effects to the presence of adverse agents in the environment; they will not, however, necessarily be skilled at developing systems for control. Industrial hygienists should provide the unique and special skills required to establish economically optimum control systems. Industrial hygiene should by then have been redefined to emphasize this critical role of its professional members. A new orientation for education is therefore proposed to provide a sound basis for the professional needs of industrial hygienists who should be at the peak of their careers in 2020. Members of the profession should then be the leaders in research on, and practice of, the science and engineering of design, installation, and monitoring of control systems for occupational and environmental hazards. The preferred educational background for entry to the profession should be some branch of engineering, which by then must have recovered its lost status and be divided into fewer specialized compartments than it is today. Engineering should provide a broader base for students entering professional education in this field, who will be more concerned with prevention and engineering control of both occupational and environmental hazards, rather than with measurement and epidemiology of the biological and toxicologic sciences. Preparation for professional work in industrial hygiene will call for the specialized education of engineers required to design and maintain processes that minimize the use, production, or generation of hazardous substances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The growth of digitalization and the abundance of information in all areas of life, including education, offer teachers and students to solve most educational problems using digital technologies and visual aids. The quality of the educational information received and processed by students, as well as the insufficient development of the use of relevant electronic visual means at the present stage of the development of the educational system makes our research relevant. The empirical basis of the study was the teaching of one of the disciplines of the Master's program of engineering training of the National Research University \"MEI\" of the Department of Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology named after G.S.

    "title": "The Junior Americanist Workshop Series",
    "abstract": "DOI:10.1017/S104909652200021X Like all modern innovations in political science, the Junior AmericanistWorkshop Series (JAWS) originated from aTwitter thread. When one of our cadre mused about whether zero-cost virtual seminars could fill the void left by themany in-person conferences andworkshops canceled or converted to costly remote formats due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we came together to answer the call (McCrain 2020). The founding vision of JAWS was to provide cost-free opportunities for early-career American politics scholars to present their research and receive feedback from leading scholars in their field.1 JAWS has evolved and currently provides free networking and professional-development opportunities, which many scholars had lost access to during the pandemic when conferences were curtailed and university buildings were closed. This article discusses how we developed JAWS, the challenges that we faced, and how we envision the workshop continuing as a complement to traditional in-person conferences in the postpandemic world. We began soliciting submissions for JAWS in August 2020 via Twitter, political science listservs (e.g., POLMETH and RACE POL), and our informal networks, which generated significant interest among potential presenters. We also invited several people, including senior scholars (i.e., tenured faculty), to volunteer as discussants, attend our sessions, and join our email list. When the number of submissions quickly surpassed 50, we promptly doubled the number of planned sessions by moving from once to twice a month to accommodate more presenters. During the 2020\u20132021 academic year, we held a total of 12 research workshops with 38 presenters that attracted a total of 632 attendees. Our Fall 2020 workshops included four presentations in two hours; in Spring 2021, we moved to two presentations in 90 minutes to allow for more engagement with each presentation. Discussants were responsible for only one paper, which made the commitment manageable for those who agreed to volunteer in that role. We also encouraged presenters to submit their papers at least one week before their session for posting them on our website so attendees could read them in advance. We made these decisions in service of our goal to provide presenters with quality feedback to which they otherwise might not have access. Overall, we successfully attracted a wide range of early-career academics to submit their work: approximately 40% of presenters were graduate students, 24% held non-tenure-track positions, and 36% were tenure-track assistant professors. We also succeeded in securing experienced discussants for our presenters: all of our discussants held PhDs and 47% were senior faculty (i.e., tenured). Although we were successful in recruiting presentations from early-career researchers, we had mixed success in ensuring diversity by gender, race, and institution type among our presenters. Fostering a diverse slate of presenters was a priority because scholars from underrepresented groups (e.g., women and people of color) and from institutions without ample financial support for faculty research (i.e., non-R1 departments) typically are perceived as lacking the very network connections that in-person conferences help to establish. Compared to the demographic characteristics of APSA members in the American politics subfield (as of February 2020), our slate of presenters included a larger percentage of women (47.3% versus 35.5%) and only a slightly smaller percentage of people of color (15.8% versus 20.7%), which suggests that we performed reasonably well in cultivating diversity by gender and race (American Political Science Association 2021). However, we performed less well in attaining institutional diversity because only 10.5% of our presenters were affiliated with non-R1 departments. This is partially an artifact of our focus on graduate students, who come predominantly from R1 universities; moving forward, we plan to account more consciously for levels of institutional support when we solicit submissions and choose presenters. This will be particularly important in the near future because those scholars with substantial institutional support (e.g., conference and travel funding) will be better advantaged by the return of traditional conference formats. In addition to our workshop series, we created a professionaldevelopment series with the goal of helping junior scholars to network and socialize in the profession. In the Spring 2021 semester, we hosted three hour-long events that brought together panelists with expertise on specific aspects of the discipline and more broadly on academia that may seem opaque to early-career scholars. Our panel topics included public scholarship, academicbook publishing, and academic-journal publishing. When we promoted these events, we broadened our outreach by emphasizing that they would be beneficial for all junior scholars rather than specifically those who study American politics. These sessions attracted 186 total attendees, and we will continue holding professional development panels in the future. A major challenge for those who want to organize virtual conferences andworkshops ismimicking the informal networking and discussion opportunities traditionally available at in-person conferences. One way that we facilitated networking was to host virtual trivia events on the same evenings as several of our JAWS panels.2 Although attendance was smaller at these events than at the panels, we still attracted 80 total attendees who convened on Zoom and received positive feedback from attendees. We are actively considering other virtual networking opportunities for the coming year, including the use of Gather (2021), and we also held a JAWS happy hour at the 2021 APSA Annual Meeting with great turnout. Although it is difficult to replicate in a virtual format the space for networking that in-person conferences afford, our goal is",

    "title": "The New Horizons Spacecraft",
    "abstract": "The New Horizons spacecraft was launched on 19 January 2006. The spacecraft was designed to provide a platform for seven instruments designated by the science team to collect and return data from Pluto in 2015. The design meets the requirements established by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Announcement of Opportunity AO-OSS-01. The design drew on heritage from previous missions developed at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and other missions such as Ulysses. The trajectory design imposed constraints on mass and structural strength to meet the high launch acceleration consistent with meeting the AO requirement of returning data prior to the year 2020. The spacecraft subsystems were designed to meet tight resource allocations (mass and power) yet provide the necessary control and data handling finesse to support data collection and return when the one-way light time during the Pluto fly-by is 4.5\u00a0hours. Missions to the outer regions of the solar system (where the solar irradiance is 1/1000 of the level near the Earth) require a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) to supply electrical power. One RTG was available for use by New Horizons. To accommodate this constraint, the spacecraft electronics were designed to operate on approximately 200 W. The travel time to Pluto put additional demands on system reliability. Only after a flight time of approximately 10 years would the desired data be collected and returned to Earth. This represents the longest flight duration prior to the return of primary science data for any mission by NASA. The spacecraft system architecture provides sufficient redundancy to meet this requirement with a probability of mission success of greater than 0.85. The spacecraft is now on its way to Pluto, with an arrival date of 14 July 2015. Initial in-flight tests have verified that the spacecraft will meet the design requirements.",

    "title": "Enabling Published Taxonomic Data to be used to Address the Biodiversity Crisis: Biodiversity Literature Repository and TreatmentBank",
    "abstract": "To understand the loss of species, a benchmark is needed, e.g. the status of biodiversity in 1992 when the Convention on Biological Diversity recognized biodiversity crisis to compare to its status in the successive year. Though we are far from knowning how many species there are on planet Earth, we keep track of their descriptions and number through the information kept in our libraries. Each species discovered is represented therein by at least one taxononic treatment. The library includes an estimated 500 million pages and is updated daily with an estimated 17\u201318,000 new species annually and over 100,000 treatments augmenting the knowledge of existing species.\n In reality, we do not know how many species exist. We know that the catalogue of life is incomplete and basic knowlege of known species is often lacking and not even updated regularly. On the other hand, the scientific standard to cite previous works and facts is at the same time an ideal prerequisit to build a knowledge graph in the era of digital knowledge.\n TreatmentBank (TB) and the Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR), two European Research Infrastructures, provide a service to convert unstructured biodiversity data from scholarly publications into semantically enhanced, digital accessible knowledge (Fawcett et al. 2022) making it findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR, Wilkinson et al. 2016) and providing long term access in collaboration with Zenodo. Data sources are either legacy publications or active journals using an XML workflow such as Zookeys or the Biodiversity Data Journal, published by the pioneer of taxonomically enhanced Taxpub XML publishing, Pensoft. As part of the Horizon 2020-funded project Biodiversity Community Integrated Knowledge Library (BiCIKL), bidirectional linking of taxonomic names with the Catalogue of Life, DNA-sequences with the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and material citations with their respective natural history collection or their depositions in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is targeted. As input to allow queries including text and data mining for traits and biotic interactions, the treatments are uploaded to the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) Library Service (SIBiLS) using TaxPub and schema based on Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) widely used in life science publishing and PubMed Central, allowing the use of the advanced text and data mining tools in the life science community. Another research infrastructure that ensures an RDF representation and conversion into Linked Open Data (LOD) is OpenBiodiv allowing users to explore DAK as part of growing linked open biodiverstiy and related data. All the data fit for GBIF use is reused by GBIF representing close to 60% of all published data sets, which makes TreatmentBank and BLR, for example, a sole provider of data for approximately 90,000 species not recorded in GBIF by other publishers.\n The long-term strategy is to build up the momentum to be an infrastructure relevant for global biodiversity conservation and research. Long-term support will be achieved by negotiations with respective agencies and publishers, and through building up a global user community using the biodiversity digital acccessible knowledge.",

    "title": "Leishmaniosis in Rodents Caused by Leishmania infantum: A Review of Studies in the Mediterranean Area",
    "abstract": "Leishmaniosis infection begins when a phlebotomine sand fly vector inoculates pathogenic protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania into a mammalian host. In the case of Leishmania infantum, the domestic dog is considered to be the main parasite reservoir, and canine leishmaniosis (CanL) has a high mortality rate in untreated dogs. Hundreds of cases of human leishmaniosis (HL) are reported in the world each year, the incidence in Europe being relatively low. Leishmaniosis control is primarily focused on the dog, combining methods that prevent sand fly bites and boost host resistance to infection. However, these measures are only partially effective and new solutions need to be found. One of the main factors limiting CanL and HL control is the existence of a sylvatic Leishmania transmission cycle that interacts with the domestic cycle maintained by dogs. It is suspected that the main reservoir of infection in wildlife are rodents, whose expansion and rapid population growth worldwide is increasing the risk of human and zoonotic pathogen transfer. The aim of this review is therefore to analyze reports in the literature that may shed light on the potential role of rodents in the leishmaniosis transmission cycle in the Mediterranean area. Following the general methodology recommended for reviews, six databases (Google Scholar, Ovid, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science) were explored for the period January 1995 to December 2020. The results extracted from 39 publications that met the established inclusion criteria were analyzed. It was found that 23 species of rodents have been studied in nine countries of the Mediterranean basin. Of the 3,643 specimens studied, 302 tested positive for L. infantum infection by serology, microscopy and/or molecular techniques.",

Malaysia selected the biotechnology sector as one of the key strategic technologies that would enable Malaysia to transform into a fully developed nation by the year 2020. However, to date, there has been very little research on the level of biotechnology literacy amongst school students in Malaysia and the aim of this study is to determine the presence of biotechnology literacy, based on knowledge, perception, and attitude. Besides, this study also determines the factors affecting the students\u2019 attitude towards biotechnology. This study is a quantitative study involving 292 secondary school students from science and non-science classes. The findings showed that overall students have what we describe as a medium level of knowledge, perception, and attitude towards biotechnology. It is anticipated that this pattern of findings can help teachers, the Ministry of Education and the media to strategically plan ahead so that improvements in the national curriculum can be proposed and implemented.",

    "title": "Nourishing Better Vision: The ARVO 2021 Mildred Weisenfeld Award Lecture",
    "abstract": "I would like to thank the ARVO Awards Committee and the ARVO Board of Trustees for selecting me to deliver this year\u2019s Mildred Weisenfeld Award Lecture. As a long-time member who attended my ARVO first meeting in the mid1980s when it was still in Sarasota, I am honored to provide an overview of my career in clinical and basic science vision research with a focus on nutrition and the eye. ARVO is the meeting that I look forward to the most every year, as it is the premier place to present the latest and greatest research work in vision in a casual and unpretentious atmosphere where I am always certain to meet up with mentors, students, and colleagues who have contributed to the work that I will present today. My service on the ARVO Program Planning Committee, as the Biochemistry Section\u2019s representative on the ARVO Board of Trustees, and as an ARVO vice-president, revealed the inner workings of an extraordinarily well-run professional organization that prioritizes nurturing the careers of rising young vision researchers. Unfortunately, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) forced the cancellation of ARVO 2020, and ARVO 2021 had to be held online only. Thus, I had to deliver this year\u2019s Weisenfeld lecture pre-recorded, with 10 minutes of live questions moderated by Dr. Michael Redmond of the National Eye Institute. Approximately 1000 participants viewed this lecture during its appointed time slot, and presumably many more have watched it on-demand since then. I look forward to seeing many of you in person again in Denver next year. Mildred Weisenfeld was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1921. She lost vision as a teenager due to retinitis pigmentosa, but she continued her education and became an energetic advocate for vision research, ultimately becoming the founder and Executive Director of Fight for Sight. I received my first competitive research grant award from Fight for Sight in 1993, so I am grateful to be able to publicly acknowledge her help in getting my career off to a good start. As a supertaster who is genetically predisposed to vehemently reject numerous \u201ceye healthy\u201d dark green cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, Brussel sprouts, and kale, as bitter and foul tasting, I am periodically asked why I am so passionate about ocular nutrition. First, of course, I do not avoid all vegetables, just the cruciferous one, and I am an avid fruit grower and consumer. Second, and more importantly, I have learned from my mentors and patients that nutrients that are naturally part of our daily diet can be an efficient and rational way to promote eye health and prevent or delay a variety of blinding disorders. From a basic and clinical science standpoint, my laboratory group and others have shown that underlying causes of many eye diseases logically point to nutritional mechanisms, and nutritional treatments can often have fewer side effects than pharmacological interventions. Patient compliance can be excellent, and eye healthy nutrients are often relatively low cost. These factors have led to strong and sustained patient and clinician interest in ocular nutrition as an empowering way to combat retinal disease. Through the years, I have developed a core set of principles to guide my research on ocular nutrition. I have repeatedly found it to be important to take cues from the natural world because if the eye is specifically or uniquely enriched with a nutrient, it is likely to have vital biological functions for vision. There also is a clear and logical progression of ocular nutrition research, starting with clinical observations and epidemiology to generate testable hypotheses. This is followed by laboratory-based biochemistry, physiology, and animal studies. Ultimately, it is desirable to do randomized, controlled human trials to provide reliable evidence and recommendations for clinicians to provide to their patients. This has been done for a handful of nutrients, such as the AREDS2 formulation, but these studies can be quite large, long, expensive, and challenging when dealing with free-living humans eating varied diets. The goal throughout my career has always been to provide the ophthalmology community with the best quality basic and clinical science to guide clinicians and the nutraceutical industry when they advise patients who are eager to know how they can take charge and slow, prevent, or even reverse their retinal diseases using readily available dietary or nutritional supplement interventions. In this lecture, I will focus on three key ocular-enriched nutrients: retinoids, carotenoids, and very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "Relevance. Potato hybrids obtained when creating varieties adapted to the weather conditions of the Komi Republic must have maximum resistance to constantly changing environmental conditions while maintaining the yield indicator at a high level. In addition, breeders impose requirements for their high field resistance to the main diseases common in the region: late blight, alternaria, rhizoctonia, scab and viruses (X, Y). In 2020, in the course of a continuously operating selection process, produced on the basis of the Institute of Agrobiotechnology FRC Komi Scientific Center of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Syktyvkar) together with the FRC potato named after A.G. Lorkh (Korenevo), samples were taken from the nursery of the main test of hybrids.Methods. The studies were carried out on five hybrids sent from the FRC of Potato named after A.G. Lorkh obtained by hybridization of the original parental forms, growing hybrid seedlings and single-root hybrids, followed by selection in nurseries of single-root hybrids, second-year hybrids, preliminary and main tests already directly at the Institute of Agrobiotechnology FRC of the Komi Scientific Center of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Observations, counts and culling in each nursery were carried out in accordance with the methodological recommendations on the technology of the potato breeding process. According to the research results, the hybrids were assessed in terms of yield, yield range (the difference between the maximum and minimum values for the study period), realization of yield potential (the ratio of the average yield to the maximum over the years of research) and coefficient of variation, as well as disease resistance.Results. As a result of a comprehensive assessment of potato samples in the nursery of the main test, three promising hybrids were identified \u2014 1992\u201314, 2000\u201360 and 2139\u2013 5 with an average yield at the level of standard varieties and higher (23.6\u201331.2t/ha), having a high stability and disease resistance.",

    "abstract": "The 2010 recommendation that the proportion of registered nurses with BSN (bachelor of science in nursing) degrees in the nursing workforce should increase from the current 40% to 80% by the year 2020 has shifted the focus on nurses educational progression from state legislatures-where changes in entry-level requirements were debated for decades-to the executive suites of large healthcare providers. The recommendation, contained in the report titled The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health, by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Initiative on the Future of Nursing at the Institute of Medicine, suggests that human resources policies for nurses have the potential to double the rates of college degree completions (IOM, 2010). We surveyed 447 nurse executives in hospitals, nurse-led clinics, and home and hospice companies to explore the current practices of healthcare employers with regard to this recommendation. Almost 80% of respondents reported that their institution either preferred or required newly hired nurses to have a bachelor's degree, and 94% of the facilities offered some level of tuition reimbursement. Only 25%, however, required their nurses to earn a BSN or offered salary differentials on the basis of educational attainment (9%). We conclude that if employers are serious about wanting a more highly educated nurse workforce, they need to adopt requirements for degree completion and wage differentials in the coming years. The likelihood that such policies will be widely adopted, however, is dramatically affected by the dynamics of nursing supply and demand.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is generating a high number of deaths worldwide. One of the current questions in the field of environmental science is to explain how air pollution can affect the impact of COVID-19 on public health. The research here focuses on a case study of Italy. Results suggest that the diffusion of COVID-19 in cities with high levels of air pollution is generating higher numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths. In particular, results reveal that, among Italian cities, the number of infected people was higher in cities with more than 100 days per year exceeding limits set for PM10 or ozone, cities located in hinterland zones (i.e. away from the coast), cities having a low average speed of wind and cities with a lower average temperature. In hinterland cities (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) having a high level of air pollution, coupled with low wind speed, the average number of infected people in April 2020\uf02dduring the first wave of the COVID-19 \uf02dis more than tripled compared to cities that low levels of air pollution. In addition, results show that more than 75% of infected individuals and about 81% of deaths of the first wave of COVID-19 in Italy are in industrialized regions with high levels of air pollution. Although these vital results of the first wave of the COVID-19 from February to August 2020, policymakers have had a low organizational capacity to plan effective policy responses for crisis management to cope with recurring COVID-19 pandemic that is generating a new wave with again negative effects, deja vu, on public health and of course economic systems.",

    "abstract": "Background: The Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP), 2004 addresses disaster preparedness, disease surveillance, disease data to respond to epidemics. The 12th Five Year Plan envisages disease surveillance for district-level laboratories and epidemic-centric diagnostic centers in consultation with the National Informatics Centers (NIC) and Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).\nObjectives: These health policies need a critical appraisal in the COVID-19 pandemic and disaster preparedness in India\u2019s system. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) pandemic cum disaster mitigation strategy analysed from risk mitigation to public health emergency in disaster management. The three-tier network labs and diagnostic centers, disease surveillance and disaster preparedness examined critically in the context of Disaster Management Act (DMA), 2005.\nMethodology: The methodology of the study derives from European disaster management response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) India Chapter and National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) disaster management strategies utilized as model for the epidemic and pandemic control. The SIR epidemiological model for the COVID-19 mortality applied in the emergency paradigm of health care system in COVID-19 pandemic.\nResults: COVID-19 pandemic and disaster preparedness in India revolves around the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 and Epidemic Diseases Act (EDA), 1897 Disaster Management Act (DMA), 2005, and Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020. The sordid and wise experiences for the Disaster Management and COVID-19 pandemic culminate into 5 Ps Disaster Management adopted by India.5 It spells out the proof of concept with social experiment, proactive approach, people management, partnership, preparation, and collaboration.\nConclusion: The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) assumes a pivotal role in controlling the infection and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic under the WHO Guideline of the disaster management cycle having a multi-component approach.

    "abstract": "Abstract Two partly conflicting academic pressures from the seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic are the need for faster peer review of Covid-19 health-related research and greater scrutiny of its findings. This paper investigates whether decreases in peer review durations for Covid-19 articles were universal across 97 major medical journals, as well as Nature, Science, and Cell. The results suggest that on average, Covid-19 articles submitted during 2020 were reviewed 1.7\u20132.1 times faster than non-Covid-19 articles submitted during 2017\u20132020. Nevertheless, while the review speed of Covid-19 research was particularly fast during the first 5 months (1.9\u20133.4 times faster) of the pandemic (January\u2013May 2020), this speed advantage was no longer evident for articles submitted in November\u2013December 2020. Faster peer review was also associated with higher citation impact for Covid-19 articles in the same journals, suggesting it did not usually compromise the scholarly impact of important Covid-19 research. Overall, then, it seems that core medical and general journals responded quickly but carefully to the pandemic, although the situation returned closer to normal within a year.",

    "title": "The COVID-19 Pandemic is Widening the Gap for Women in STEM",
    "abstract": "The emergence of the COVID-19 virus in 2019 and its global spread in 2020 presented unprecedented challenges to the world. The virus, which is characterized by high infection and mortality rates, overwhelmed healthcare systems. Governmental leaders, under the guidance of public health officials, responded by putting communities in various states of lockdown to mitigate the spread until healthcare systems could recover. Businesses and schools closed, and many workers were forced to work remotely while children learned how to survive academically in a virtual school environment. The pandemic changed nearly every facet of work and home life, creating a difficult environment for everyone. It is natural for those of us with a mindset toward diversity and inclusion to wonder how marginalized groups are faring in the midst of this global pandemic. Admittedly, there have been multiple accounts of how the pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minorities both in terms of the number of COVID-19 cases and the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths, due in large part to the social, economic, environmental, and political factors that disadvantage members of the African American, Native American, and Latinx communities. At the same time, the data show that millions of women have been pushed out of the workforce to care for children and other dependents due to loss of in-person schooling and child-/ dependent care. Many women opted to stay in the workforce and simultaneously work while providing care for their dependents. Anecdotally, children \u201cZoom-bombing\u201d their parents\u2019 work calls became an all-too-familiar sight in 2020. Prior to the pandemic, the disparities between women and men in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) persisted despite the many efforts to achieve gender parity, and it is important to note that women who are racial or ethnic minorities have been more significantly disadvantaged. To illustrate the disparity between women and men in STEM, the National Science Foundation reports that 41% of science and engineering doctorates were awarded to women in 2017 despite the fact that women made up 51.5% of the population in the U.S. Note that the percentage of degrees awarded varies drastically by field, with women making up 75% of doctoral degrees in psychology and only 24% in engineering. The reasons for women being underrepresented are complex and involve a range of social and environmental factors, including negative stereotypes and implicit biases that propagate from schools to the workforce. Now that we have gone more than a year in the \u201cpost-COVID-19 world,\u201d it is worth exploring how the gender gap for women in STEM has been affected by the pandemic and discuss strategies for bridging the gap. Since March 2020, many in the U.S. workforce have been working remotely, and a large number of K12 schools are still in a virtual or hybrid setting. Daycares are working at reduced capacity, and home care for adult dependents is still not fully accessible. Women have traditionally taken on the brunt of unpaid caregiving duties, and this is no less apparent during the pandemic. The United Nations reports that the lack of childcare during the pandemic has placed an undue burden on women to fill the need for childcare, thereby restricting their ability to work. Power states that this is at least in part due to the persistence of traditional gender roles and because women\u2019s participation in the workforce is more likely to be \u201cpart-time, flexible, and less remunerative.\u201d Considering all of these factors, the question arises, \u201cHow are women in male-dominated fields like STEM affected by the COVID-19 pandemic?\u201d This article aims to shed some light on the situation for women in STEM. 1521-9615 2021 IEEE Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/MCSE.2021.3067421 Date of current version 15 June 2021.",

    "abstract": "Background: The extent of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children and adolescents at a population level in 2021 remains unclear. Children and adolescents have been considered to play an important role in transmission regardless of presence of symptoms. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in children ages 5-to-19 years in a sample from the State of Texas in the presence and absence of symptoms. \n \nMethods: The TX CARES (Texas Coronavirus Antibody Response Survey) is an ongoing prospective population-based sample from the Texas general population (~29\u00b78 million) that commenced in October 2020. For the current analysis, volunteers ages 5-to-19 years were recruited throughout the state from large pediatric healthcare systems, Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers, urban and rural pediatric and family medicine practices, health insurance providers, and a social media campaign. SARS-CoV-2 antibody status measured via the Roche Elecsys\u00ae Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassay. Prevalence of IgM, IgA, or IgG antibodies were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification of age and sex. We report here findings from January 1-June 1, 2021. \n \nFindings: This analysis that included 503 children ages 5-to-19 years showed 38\u00b77% (95% CI, 34\u00b75-43\u00b71) of the sample was SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive in fully adjusted estimates. A total of 30\u00b71% (95% CI, 29\u00b74-31\u00b75) of adults (N=6992) in the sample were antibody positive. Over half (55\u00b78%) of those with positive antibody status were reportedly asymptomatic. Headache (25\u00b74%), congestion/runny nose (20\u00b78%), and fatigue (20\u00b73%) and were the most frequently reported symptoms among those with a positive antibody result. The odds of having a positive antibody status was 37% higher in 15-to-19 year olds versus adults (OR 1\u00b737, 95% CI, 1\u00b703-1\u00b783). \n \nInterpretation: These results highlight that a majority of the pediatric population remains immunologically naive to SARS-CoV-2, emphasizing the important role vaccines may play in reaching whole population herd immunity. \n \nFunding: Texas Department of State Health Services. \n \nDeclaration of Interest: We declare no competing interests. \n \nEthical Approval: All protocols were reviewed and approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Institutional Review Board (IRB), but also deemed public health practice by the Texas Department of State Health Services IRB.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of climate change communication is incommunicado when there is a lack of comprehensive efforts to increase public knowledge and encourage proactive steps. The main objective of this study is to examine the evolving trends in publication and the developmental trajectory within climate change communication research, development, and publications. This study utilised datasets from the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases, which were further analysed using the ScientoPy and VOSviewer. The findings suggest that there has been a notable increase in the number of publications since 2008, particularly in the WoS database, indicating a growing recognition and a more focused endeavour by researchers to delve into climate change communication. The most frequent keywords employed by past researchers were \u201cClimate Change\u201d, \u201cClimate Change communication\u201d, and \u201cClimate communication\u201d. The emergence of keywords such as \u201csocial media\u201d, \u201cscience communication\u201d, \u201cenvironmental communication\u201d, \u201cframing\u201d, and \u201cclimate action\u201d in the year 2020 onwards signifies their recent prominence. Examining research growth and trends in climate change communication provides valuable insights into the advancements, recurring topics, and prominent individuals within this discipline. In a nutshell, the current study highlights the significance of proficient communication in tackling the intricate issues associated with climate change that can be a reference to potential readers and future researchers keen on this domain.",

He is an internationally renowned expert in radiative transfer and light scattering dealing with full Mueller matrix/Stokes vector processes. He has made significant contributions in using radiative transfer in such diverse areas as biomedical optics, planetary atmospheres, cloud and aerosol property studies related to climate studies, invisibility cloaking, ultrashort laser propagation in water, and anthrax detection. To list just a few among his seminal contributions, he was the first to show that the clouds of Venus were not water, which was the view held by two eminent scientists Carl Sagan and Richard Goody. It was this seminal work which led to the ultimate determination of the Venus cloud composition. He is one of the first researchers to apply Monte Carlo techniques to radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres. This technique is now being used by researchers all over the world and is also now being used in medical physics. He gave the first correct explanation of the \u201cRing effect\u201d which had remained an enigma for over twenty years. This paper was designated by a world-renowned scientist at NASA to be the best paper of the decade in atmospheric science. Dr. Kattawar and his collaborators developed one of the most powerful time dependent, three-dimensional Monte Carlo codes capable of handling full Mueller matrix solutions for a coupled atmosphere-ocean system with a fully stochastic interface. This code will become the \u201cGold Standard\u201d for all future researchers in biomedical, atmospheric, and oceanic optics. He is one of the first to show that nonspherical objects can be made totally invisible if the optical properties are selected in the right way. Dr. Kattawar received many awards and recognitions, including Fellow of the Optical Society of America (1976); Amoco Foundation Teaching Excellence Award (1981); Teacher/Scholar Award (1990), Nils Gunnar Jerlov Award (2014), and van de Hulst Light Scattering Award (2015); He was also elected for two, three-year terms on the Committee on Recommendations for U.S. Army Basic Scientific Research under the National Research Council. He is a former Associate Editor of the Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans and a former Associate Editor of the Journal of Transport Theory and Statistical Physics. He was selected to be editor of the Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Milestone Series on \u201cMultiple Scattering in Plane Parallel Atmospheres and Oceans: Techniques\u201d. He was selected (2009) to serve on the External Advisory Board of the Stevens Institute of Technology to assess their engineering and science programs. He was appointed as Academic Advisor of the Board of Directors of the Texas Academy of Science. He was selected by Applied Optics as one of the 50 most prolific authors in the last 50 years.\n",

    "title": "Preparing for Brexit.",
    "abstract": "The hubbub of conversation fills the air as 50 early-career researchers (ECRs) discuss our futures after Brexit. Flipboards around the room fill with sticky notes, each with a scribbled thought or idea. A board labeled \u201cWhat will Brexit mean for your career?\u201d highlights the toll it has already taken. One scientist abandoned their application for the European Union's Horizon 2020 funding program. Others are reluctantly making plans to leave the United Kingdom. A note with the word \u201cuncertainty\u201d stands out in the middle of the board. And yet, a month before the official Brexit date, the atmosphere is surprisingly positive. Coming together to discuss these challenges seems to be giving us confidence that we will find a way forward.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\n> \u201cI thought a workshop might help us figure out how to move forward.\u201d \n\nAfter the British public voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, everything felt up in the air. ECRs already face huge career uncertainty because of our time-limited contracts and increasing pressures on funding and publishing. For those of us in the United Kingdom\u2014and anyone who might have considered coming here\u2014Brexit is making it that much worse. I travel abroad for collaboration and fieldwork every year. Will that get a lot harder? Will funding become even scarcer when EU grants are no longer available? An estimated 50% of postgraduate research scientists in the United Kingdom come from abroad. Will they still be able to work and study here?\n\nAs the referendum result sank in, I wanted answers to these questions, and I knew other ECRs felt the same way. I thought a workshop might help us figure out how to move forward, so I assembled a team of organizers and began to recruit speakers. Finding scientists prepared to discuss Brexit outside the usual environs of the pub or coffee room was not easy, but we got the support of the British Ecological Society and eventually booked a date for February 2019.\n\nWhen I arrived in London that morning, I worried that the ongoing uncertainty about how exactly the United Kingdom will leave the European Union might spell ruin for the event. I had assumed that the government would have some sort of plan by the time our workshop rolled around, and that we would be able to dig into the specifics of what Brexit would mean for scientists. That plan had not materialized.\n\nBut I needn't have worried. Our speakers provided great insight about what could happen, and the attendees engaged in positive, vibrant discussions about how they could influence events or adapt. At lunch, I noticed that Twitter was alive with ECRs\u2014including many attendees and thousands of others outside the room\u2014using the hashtag we had created for the event, #ECRsChatBrexit. I tapped away on my phone and chipped in over mouthfuls of sandwich, happy that we had created a space for people to talk about this.\n\nSo, what did everyone have to say? Well, like most scientists, our attendees wish the government would take a longer-term approach to science policymaking, as well as funding and developing the people involved in research. We also discussed how Brexit might offer opportunities for ECRs to step up and play a role in shaping policy. For example, a proposed minimum salary threshold for the immigration of highly skilled workers could seriously limit the ability of ECRs to move to the United Kingdom. We should be weighing in and making sure that lawmakers recognize these implications. The U.K. government will also be writing new environmental policy. Will those of us early in our careers find our voice and reimagine how this policy could work\u2014how it should work?\n\nOf course, we can't solve all these problems ourselves\u2014or in a single day. But raising our concerns and discussing solutions certainly helped get things clearer in our heads.\n\nWhat happens in the United Kingdom over the next few years will define scientists' working lives for decades to come. For us ECRs, that will be most of our careers. We have the biggest stake in the game. We should have our say in it. Hopefully, our workshop was just the beginning of that conversation.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Stigmatization towards cancer is a barrier to early cancer screening and treatment. This study was conducted to determine the level of cancer stigma among Malaysian university students in Malaysia with different sociodemographic backgrounds.Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 400 students (mean age, SD = 22.22 \u00b1 1.67 years) from a selected university in Malaysia. Data were collected from October 2019 to February 2020 through an online survey. The Cancer Stigma Scale (CASS) was used in assessing the levels of cancer stigma among university students with different courses and social backgrounds. The CASS was used in assessing multiple aspects of cancer stigma, including severity, personal responsibility, awkwardness, avoidance, policy opposition, and financial discrimination.Results: Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 23). Results showed that the stigmatization level toward cancer among university students varied across the six subscales. Items regarding the severity of a cancer diagnosis showed the highest level of agreement (32\u201352%; M = 3.05, SD = 0.96), whereas the item \u2018avoiding someone with cancer\u2019 showed the lowest agreement, 7\u201310% (Mean = 1.85, SD = 0.97). Stigma was significantly higher in young students, males, non-health science students, students in the junior year level, students without family histories of cancer, and the low-income group (p < 0.05).Conclusion: These findings may provide a benchmark of stigmatization level among university students in Malaysia and may be a valuable basis for delivering information and education on cancer screening and treatment.",

    "title": "Zooming in on Open Access in Ukraine",
    "abstract": "In October 2022, Ukraine declared its commitment to enhancing the effectiveness, quality and responsiveness of its research by implementing the National Plan for Open Science (Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, 2022). This document represents a significant step forward in aligning Ukraine's national legislation with European Union requirements and promoting the adoption of open science practices. Open access (OA) is a crucial component of open science, and it is imperative to gain insight into its growth to inform funding policies and plan infrastructure development accordingly.The aim of this research is to obtain a comprehensive overview of the OA development in Ukraine. To achieve this goal, publications affiliated with Ukrainian research institutions and universities in the period from 2012 to 2021 were collected from three well-known databases: Dimensions, Web of Science, and Scopus. Records were gathered in November 2022 using the web interfaces of WoS and Scopus, while data from Dimensions was extracted via the Dimensions API. After excluding duplicates and publications without DOIs, the OA status of each publication was determined using the Unpaywall API.\nThe study revealed that between 2012 and 2021, authors affiliated with Ukrainian research institutions and universities published 201,670 research papers. Of these publications, 66.7% were open access, while the remaining 33.3% were behind a paywall. The percentage of OA articles for the indicated 10-year period increased substantially from 33.8% in 2012 to 79.9% in 2021.Gold open access was the most common OA subtype, with 68.4% of articles published in OA journals. The second most frequent choice was bronze open access, accounting for 15.3% of articles. Green subtype and hybrid were less commonly used, with 8.5% and 7.8% of articles published in these categories, respectively.Regarding the distribution of open access across different academic disciplines, the highest percentage of OA publications was found in the social sciences, with a rate of 88.1%, followed closely by the humanities at 87.8%, and medical and health sciences at 73.4%. Agriculture sciences, multidisciplinary studies, and natural sciences also exhibited relatively high levels of OA publications, representing 71.7%, 63.4%, and 55.7%, respectively. The lowest proportion of OA publications was observed in the engineering and technology category, with a rate of 47.7%.This empirical study indicates that the share of OA publications in Ukraine is significantly higher than the global average of 31% reported by Piwowar, Priem, and Orr in 2019 and their estimation of 44% by 2025 (Piwowar et al., 2019). Notably, Ukraine is approaching the indicators of European \"openness\" leaders, such as Great Britain, Sweden, Austria, and the Netherlands (Robinson-Garcia et al., 2020). It is worth mentioning that northern and central European countries have been early adopters of open access policies (Maddi et al., 2021), while Ukraine lacks mandates for research dissemination through OA, transformative agreements and only a few institutions have registered their OA policy with ROARMAP. The high share of OA publications in Ukraine can be partially attributed to the longstanding tradition of national journals being open access and fully subsidized by hosting research institutions. Therefore, open access has always been a part of the research dissemination culture in Ukraine (Novikov, 2020).",

    "abstract": "Aim: Consistent innovation is essential given the crucial necessity of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses that are life-threatening. In the literature so far no bibliometric analysis on pediatric ECMO has been done. We aim to undertake a bibliometric review of the ECMO literature to inform evidence-based innovation, emphasizing key trends and advancements in pediatric ECMO.\nMaterials and Methods: The Web of Science (WoS) database was used to retrieve articles about pediatric ECMO that were published between 1970 and 2022, and these articles were then examined using statistical and bibliometric techniques. Effective analysis and trending topics were identified using network visualization maps.\nResults: The search for pediatric ECMO literature turned up 726 documents. The publications received 7984 total citations, with an average of 11 citations per publication. The Hirsch (H)-Index was 45, and articles made up 55.51% of the publications. The pediatric ECMO papers received an average of 18.03 citations per article, for a total of 7267 and with 44 H-index. The highest publishing year was 2020 (n=80). The majority of the articles (67.906%) originated in the United States. The other top 5 nations were Canada (4.132%), Italy (3.581%), Australia (3.168%), China (3.030%), and Germany (2.893%).\nConclusion: This article can be a useful resource for investigators concerning global output for pediatric ECMO use. The United States ranked first in the number of publications and citations. With the increasing number of publications and implementation, ECMO needs to become more widespread around the world.",

    "title": "Changes in Notifiable Infectious Diseases in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Surveillance Study",
    "abstract": "Background: Nationwide nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) were used to combat the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during 2020 in the mainland of China. These NPIs have proven effective on mitigating the spread of COVID-19, but their broad impact on other diseases remains under-investigated. In this study, we aim to assess whether such broad impact exists on notifiable diseases in China. \n \nMethods: Weekly incidence and mortality data for 31 major notifiable infectious diseases at the province level were extracted from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention from 2014 to 2020. We assessed the impact of NPIs by contrasting the incidences of each infectious disease in predefined COVID-19 phases during 2020 to the average incidences in the corresponding time intervals during 2014-2019. \n \nFindings: We observed decreased incidences of most diseases during the phases after the lockdown of Wuhan. In general, respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal or enteroviral diseases were more affected than sexually transmitted or bloodborne diseases and vector-borne or zoonotic diseases. Seasonal flu and rubella were the most sensitive to the NPIs, with reductions of 67-99% in incidence rates throughout the NPI-implemented phases in China (Jan 27-Dec 31, 2020). Among gastrointestinal or enteroviral diseases, the hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) was subject to the largest declines during Jan 27-Aug 31, 2020, with >90% reduction in incidence rate. Phases with more stringent NPIs were associated with more reductions. Non-respiratory diseases, particularly HFMD, gonorrhea and brucellosis, rebounded towards the end of the year as the NPIs were relaxed. \n \nInterpretation: NPIs are broadly effective in containing infectious diseases. Less disruptive NPIs such as wearing face masks are still effective in mitigating respiratory diseases but are not adequate for containing non-respiratory diseases. \n \nFunding Statement: This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Funds [91846302, 81825019], the China Mega-Project on Infectious Disease Prevention [2018ZX10713001, 2018ZX10713002, 2018ZX10201001 and 2017ZX10103004], and the US National Institutes of Health [R56 AI148284]. \n \nDeclaration of Interests: All authors declare no competing interests. \n \nEthics Approval Statement: Missing.",

    "title": "International Standard of Transdisciplinary Education and Transdisciplinary Competence",
    "abstract": "Aim/Purpose: The year 2020 marks the 50th anniversary of the first official definition of the term \u201ctransdisciplinarity.\u201d This paper focuses on a critical analysis of the development of modern transdisciplinarity since its inception.\n\nBackground: The article presents two main directions for the development of transdisciplinarity. It also shows its identification features, strengths, and weaknesses, as well as the significant role transdisciplinarity plays in science and education.\n\nMethodology: The methodology employed in this article is a content analysis of resolutions of international forums as well as articles on transdisciplinarity published from 1970 to 2019.\n\nContribution: For one reason or the other, several of these authors did not quote the opinions of the original authors of transdisciplinarity. The subsequent use of those articles by other authors thus posed some ambiguities about the place and role of transdisciplinarity in science and education. The advent of e-databases has made it possible to access the original forum articles. This further made it possible to refine the original content of the term \u201ctransdisciplinarity\u201d and to trace its development without mixing it with vague opinions. Based on these findings, the perception of transdisciplinarity as a marginal trend in science and education could be eliminated. \n\nFindings: This paper shows how modern transdisciplinarity is developing into two main directions: transdisciplinarity in science as well as transdisciplinarity in education. These orientations have individual goals and objectives. The transdisciplinarity of scientific research helps to complete the transformation of the potential for interdisciplinary interaction and the integration of disciplines. Whereas, in education, transdisciplinarity (meta-discipline) is about developing an international standard for transdisciplinary education and also describing the content of transdisciplinary competence for students of diverse disciplines at all levels of higher education (bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s and postgraduate studies).\n\nRecommendation for Researchers: Transdisciplinary research involves the interaction of people with disciplinary knowledge plus a degree of scientific outlook. Since disciplinary knowledge domains remain in their disciplinary boxes, it is, therefore, advisable to generalize disciplinary knowledge rather than force them to interact. This is the basis for proposing the systems transdisciplinary approach\u2014which provides a methodology for unifying and generalizing disciplinary knowledge.\n\nFuture Research: As the research shows, the organizers of modern international forums do not take into account the division of transdisciplinarity development trends. To increase the effectiveness and significance of such forums, it is necessary to return to the practice of organizing special international forums on the transdisciplinarity of science and that of education. \n\n",

    "title": "Intermittent fasting: promising premises or broken promises?",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, intermittent fasting (better defined as \u201cintermittent energy restriction\u201d) has been considered of major interest as an alternative strategy to continuous caloric restriction for weight loss (Rynders et al. 2019). In fact, while dietary energy reduction (relatively to one\u2019s energy requirements) may lead to a relative small effect on body weight (about 5\u201310% weight reduction over a year) with substantial weight regain once the caloric restriction is interrupted, an intermittent fasting approach has been supposed to improve the patient compliance by limiting the caloric restriction to certain days and allowing ad libitum feeding over the remaining weekly days (Rynders et al. 2019). The rationale for the enthusiasm regarding this potential strategy lies in the results of preclinical studies, in which it has been observed that fasting would induce sirtuin pathway and stimulate a metabolic adaptation towards weight loss (Madeo et al. 2019). However, the findings from clinical studies are not as striking as those from animal studies: recent meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials conducted on overweight/obese individuals showed that intermittent fasting would lead to similar results than continuous energy restriction, especially in the short term, with insufficient evidence to support its long-term effects (Harris, Hamilton, et al. 2018; Harris, McGarty, et al. 2018). In this issue of International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition, a systematic review from Sandoval et al provided an overview of studies conducted on trained or overweight individuals younger than 60 years old showing potential effects on body composition (i.e. decreasing fat mass and maintaining muscle mass) irrespective of body weight, as well as potential effects on biomarkers of metabolic health (including GLP-1, insulin, and glucose levels) (Sandoval et al. 2021). These findings are still limited by the design of the studies included (some observational) and the not univocal definitions for the intervention. Moreover, the long-term effects of such strategy are still to be elucidated, failing to result superior in patients\u2019 compliance compared to other weightloss approaches. More acceptable forms of intermittent fasting have been proposed as alternatives, including the fasting-mimicking diet (characterised by a low caloric intake with a small contribution of carbohydrates and proteins and a high fat intake) (Sofi 2020) and the time restricted feeding (characterised by feeding time restricted to 8\u201310 h per day, with no real recommendation on energy intake) (Currenti et al. 2020). While both such approaches have been extensively discussed in review articles underlying strengths and limitations of current evidence (Hoddy et al. 2020; Fanti et al. 2021), our journal also published interesting original articles showing the potential for a time-restricted feeding approach in the context of Mediterranean populations, which could benefit from both diet quality and restricted eating window of time. Specifically, time-restricted eating was associated with better anthropometric profiles (Karras, Koufakis, Adamidou, Antonopoulou, et al. 2021; Karras, Koufakis, Adamidou, Polyzos, et al. 2021) and improved plasma levels of adiponectin (Karras, Koufakis, Adamidou, Dimakopoulos, et al. 2021) and vitamin D (Rodopaios et al. 2021) in Greek Ortodox older individuals. Similar observations have been reported by our research group on older Southern Italian adults, concerning better metabolic (Currenti, Buscemi, et al. 2021) and mental health status (Currenti, Godos, et al. 2021a; Currenti, Godos, et al. 2021b) in individuals eating within a restricted window of time (<10 h). Although not yet supported by clinical trials, we may hypothesise that the reasons for such significant findings might rely on the observation for such behaviour (reduced eating window of time) embedded within the context of the overall lifestyle, characterised by chronicity and longterm adoption, in good balance with moderate physical activity and adequate not excessive calorie intake. There is no further scientific evidence on this matter, and additional studies are needed to clarify such hypotheses. However, it is crucial to understand whether the effects obtained by intermittent fasting (as time restricted feeding or other approaches) are related to the caloric restriction, to physiological changes in body hormonal and gut microbial homeostasis, or whether, on the contrary, the desired effects cannot be reached until the intervention becomes a lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Background: &nbsp;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted HIV prevention strategies globally. However, changes in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence and HIV-related behaviors, and their associations with medication adherence among MSM PrEP users remains unclear since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;Methods:&nbsp;A longitudinal observational study of HIV-negative MSM PrEP users was conducted in four Chinese metropolises from February to March 2020, assessing the changes in PrEP adherence and HIV-related behaviours before and during the COVID-19. The primary outcome was poor PrEP adherence determined from self-reported missing at least one PrEP dose in the previous month. We used mulitivariable logistic regression to determine factors correlated with poor adherence during the COVID-19. Findings:&nbsp;We enrolled 791 eligible participants (418 [52\u00b78%] in daily PrEP, 373 [47\u00b72%] in event-driven PrEP). Compared with the data conducted before the COVID-19, the proportion of PrEP users decreased from 97\u00b79% to 64\u00b73%, and the proportion of poor PrEP adherence increased from 23.6% to 50\u00b71% during the COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 3\u00b724, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2\u00b761\u20134\u00b702). While the percentage of condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with regular partners (11\u00b78% vs 25\u00b77%) and with casual partners (4\u00b74% vs 9\u00b70%) both significantly increased. The proportion of those who were tested for HIV decreased from 50\u00b71% to 25\u00b79%. Factors correlated with poor PrEP adherence during the COVID-19 included not being tested for HIV (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1\u00b738 [95% CI: 1\u00b700, 1\u00b791]), using condoms consistently with regular partners (vs. never, aOR=2\u00b719 [95% CI: 1\u00b716, 4\u00b713]) and being married or cohabitating with a woman (vs. not married, aOR=3\u00b708 [95% CI: 1\u00b760, 5\u00b795]). Interpretation: &nbsp;Increased poor PrEP adherence and CAI along with the decrease in HIV testing can lead to increases in HIV acquisition and of drug resistance to PrEP. Targeted interventions are needed to improve PrEP adherence and HIV prevention strategies. Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IIN-17013762).

    "title": "Inequity in Inequity: Disproportional Mortality Risk From SARS in Cancer Patients With COVID-19 in Brazil: A Call to Action",
    "abstract": "Background: Cancer was one of the biggest global challenges in public health before COVID-19 pandemic and even higher challenge in low- and middle-developed countries. Confronting both conditions reveal inequalities. We determined lethality and factors associated with mortality in cancer patients who developed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to COVID-19 in a northeast region of Brazil.Methods: Cross-sectional study developed from secondary data of a Brazilian state. We selected cases of cancer patients aged 20 years or older, who developed SARS due to COVID-19 (confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) and were notified between March 07, 2020, and May 08, 2021. Logistic regression analyzed the effects of different variables on lethality.Findings: We identified 756 cancer patients aged 66\u00b73\u00b115\u00b73 years (51\u00b79% males). Global lethality was 75\u00b78% and progressively increased with age. Tumor type was not described in 25\u00b75% (193) of patients, 3\u00b72% had history of cancer, 11\u00b76% had hematologic cancer, and 59\u00b77% had solid tumors. However, different types or topography of tumors did not influence mortality risk. Adjusted multivariate analyses showed age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1\u00b702;95%CI 1.01-1\u00b703;p < 0\u00b7001) and previous chronic pulmonary disease (aOR 2\u00b702;95%CI 0\u00b796-4\u00b728;p = 0\u00b7064) as risk factors for mortality, and overweight (aOR 0\u00b750;95%CI 0\u00b723-1\u00b710;p = 0\u00b7087) and cough (aOR 0\u00b757;95% I 0\u00b740-0\u00b783;p = 0\u00b7003) as protective factors.Interpretation: Cancer patients who developed SARS due to COVID-19 presented a highly disproportional mortality risk. Death was high in the study population, age increased by 2% the chance of death for each year of life, and lethality was higher in patients older than 80 years. Coordinated proactive strategies are needed to reduce the probability of infection and increase safety and early detection in cancer patients.Funding: This work was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1004701, LD), the National Nature Science Foundation of China (82001629 for XS;81871128, 81571391 and 81401166 for LD;82030040 for HS), the Jiangsu Province Social Development Project (BE2018602, HS), Jiangsu Provincial Medical Youth Talent (QNRC2016006, LD), the Youth Program of Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20200116, XS) and Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Research Funding (2021K277B, XS).Declaration of Interest: The authors have declared that no conflicts of interest exist.Ethical Approval: The human studies were approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shandong University (IRB No. 2021-45), and all samples were donated voluntarily for scientific research after informed consent was obtained.",

This conference invited professional experts from reputable international universities over the world to review the submissions. The papers in this proceeding have passed the vigorous review process and amended to the satisfaction of reviewers. Papers in the proceeding can be categorised as the following 2 topics: Material Performance Experiment and Analysis; Mechanical Design and Control Technology. CMAME2020 received more than 30 papers, 10 of them was accepted and published on the conference proceeding successfully. Meanwhile, this conference, attracts lots of scholars from Australia, China, Thailand, Russia, Vietnam, China, India, Jordan and Indonesia. Because of the outbreak of COVID-19, CMAME2020 conference committees decide to change the onsite interactive academic conference to online remote conference. It\u2019s pity that we cannot have a face-face communication and discussion on advanced science and technology on mechanical, automotive and materials engineering this year for serious epidemic situation. But I would also like to thank the conference committee, the conference secretariat, keynote speakers and all participants for their hard work making this conference a success. Looking forward to the next meeting on 2021. List of CMAME2020 Conference Committees is available in this pdf.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of using Epley\u2019s manoeuvre in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Generally BPPV is a self-limiting disorder that can resolve spontaneously due to the ability of the endolymph to dissolve otoconia. Traditionally, fatiguing vestibular rehabilitation exercises were given to patients with persistent BPPV. The introduction of the Canalith Repositioning procedure (CRP) or Particle Repositioning Manoeuvre (PRM) by Semont and Epley has revolutionized the management of BPPV to the point that most physicians, paramedical health care providers and even self-treated patients have used these manoeuvre. Our study is conducted to prove the efficacy of particle repositioning manoeuvres in the treatment of BPPV.Aim: To evaluate the outcome of Epley Maneuver in treating Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).Materials and Methods: This study was conducted in the ENT department of Sree Mookambika Institute of Medical Sciences, Kulasekharam, Kanyakumari district in a time period from December 2019 to February 2020. The sample size was taken as 35 patients who had presented with complaints of giddiness, dix hallpike\u2019s and Epley\u2019s maneuver were done for those patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The study was conducted after obtaining the clearance from Institutional Human Ethical Committee.Study Design: Prospective descriptive study.Results and analysis: When interviewed at the time of conducting the study, the vast majority of the patients claimed a dramatic improvement reflected in complete cessation of vertigo in 31 patients (88 %). In the remaining 4 patients, 2 patients showed improvement at the end of 1 week and two patient claimed no relief at all. Even though literature claims up to 30% of recurrence within one year in our study no patient had recurrence within this six months follow up.Conclusion: Epley Maneuver is safe, reliable and effective procedure that can be performed in general practice at the bedside without having any significant side effects in treating patients with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo.Posterior semicircular canal involvement is most common. Right side is predominant to left. Particle repositioning manoeuvre is effective way to treat and give immediate relief to the patients even though it is a self-limiting disease.",

    "title": "Social Environmental Inequalities in France When Facing Covid-19 Health Crisis",
    "abstract": "The worldwide health crisis of SARS-CoV-2, the so-called Coronavirus, is a strong transdisciplinary exercise due its multisectoral societal actors that are involved in giving perspectives to build accurate responses for that. When facing this challenge of health crisis by getting close to a particular data, information or statistics that concerns the disease itself, we find that a health crisis is not a simple health problem, but health is also a matter of access to a healthy environment and it is about social issues as well. We cannot treat ecosystem in a reductionist perspective anymore, because the problems are not isolated, but on the contrary, they are inter related to each other. From now on, we are invited to consider the great interdependence of different systems of thinking and action. A Science that looks beyond the disciplines themselves. Alternatively, we could say an \u201cecological thinking\u201d (Morin, 2020, p.35 [1]), in the sense that the ecological problem is not just about our relation with nature, but also the relations with ourselves. According to Barton, H. and Grant, M. (2006 [2]): \u201cThe links between health and settlements are often indirect and complex. A tool to improve understanding and foster collaboration between planning and health decision-makers is badly needed\u201d. For that, the authors have developed a health map that represents the complexity of socio-ecological systems, in which the category of \u201cpeople\u201d is centered positioned and simultaneously surrounded by several layers, like lifestyle, community, local economy, built environment, natural environment, and global ecosystems. If we take the centrality of people for our analyses in the context of France during the period of major demand of health care in the first half of the year of 2020 still in the first coronavirus wave in Europe, we will find many social environmental inequalities in the access of this care. From ecological political studies, Machado (2020, p.29 [3]) points out that one third of the world human population is under social isolating measures and two thirds of world human population is under the yoke of",

    "abstract": "The National Cancer Institute\u2019s Small Business Innovation Research Development Center (NCI SBIR) provides federal research and development funding and commercialization resources to more than 400 small businesses each year developing novel technologies to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer. Although federal funding is vital for life science startups at the early stage of development, it is often insufficient to translate the technology from discovery to commercial product. Early\u2010stage startups must connect to follow\u2010on capital and resources to bring NCI\u2010funded technologies to patients. Most startups face challenges in securing additional funding due to lack of access to investors and strategic partners and the ability to effectively pitch their technology. In 2015, the NCI SBIR started the Investor Initiatives program to connect funded small businesses with targeted investors and strategic partners to address the aforementioned obstacles. This program leverages an extensive network of investors and partners to conduct business\u2010focused reviews and provide pitch coaching. The program incentivizes earlier collaborations between NCI\u2010funded companies and private investors through various channels. The program has supported 117 companies from years 2016\u20132019 to attend 27 investor showcase events. Follow\u2010up surveys show that the program and the assistance offered by NCI SBIR have contributed to a total of 32 completed deals as of April 29, 2020. This paper will discuss the Investor Initiatives program and its outcomes from 2016 to 2019 and demonstrate the effectiveness of a federal program that leverages public\u2010private partnerships to assist portfolio companies with raising follow\u2010on funding to accelerate the translation of research into clinical practice.",

    "title": "Mortality and Clinical Interventions in Critically ill Patient With Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Objective: The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to summarize the current existing evidence on the outcome of critically ill patients with COVID-19 as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical interventions. Data Sources: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane library, Web of Science, the China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data from their inception to May 15, 2021. The search strings consisted of various search terms related to the concepts of mortality of critically ill patients and clinical interventions. Study Selection: After eliminating duplicates, two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts first, and then the full texts of potentially relevant articles were reviewed to identify cohort studies and case series that focus on the mortality of critically ill patients and clinical interventions. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19. The secondary outcomes included all sorts of supportive care. Results: There were 27 cohort studies and six case series involving 42,219 participants that met our inclusion criteria. All-cause mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) was 35% and mortality in hospital was 32% in critically ill patients with COVID-19 for the year 2020, with very high between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 97%; p < 0.01). In a subgroup analysis, the mortality during ICU hospitalization in China was 39%, in Asia\u2014except for China\u2014it was 48%, in Europe it was 34%, in America it was 15%, and in the Middle East it was 39%. Non-surviving patients who had an older age [\u22128.10, 95% CI (\u22129.31 to \u22126.90)], a higher APACHE II score [\u22124.90, 95% CI (\u22126.54 to \u22123.27)], a higher SOFA score [\u22122.27, 95% CI (\u22122.95 to \u22121.59)], and a lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio [34.77, 95% CI (14.68 to 54.85)] than those who survived. Among clinical interventions, invasive mechanical ventilation [risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% CI (0.39\u20130.61)], kidney replacement therapy [RR 0.34, 95% CI (0.26\u20130.43)], and vasopressor [RR 0.54, 95% CI (0.34\u20130.88)] were used more in surviving patients. Conclusions: Mortality was high in critically ill patients with COVID-19 based on low-quality evidence and regional difference that existed. The early identification of critical characteristics and the use of support care help to indicate the outcome of critically ill patients.",

    "abstract": "When the first vaccines were authorized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) in December 2020, its death toll exceeded 2,500,000 deaths globally. Basic science showed an unprecedented pace in its response to the virus with the synthesis of mRNA1273 (Spikevax), the active substance of a COVID19 vaccine, on January 13, 3 weeks prior to the first confirmed death in the United States. Can regulatory science accelerate access to vaccinations, prevent deaths, and overcome the evidence\u2013 time dilemma in future pandemics? The death toll of the COVID19 pandemic has only been exceeded by the Spanish Flu in 1918. Early in the first wave of the pandemic, a highly disproportionate distribution of COVID19 infections and deaths was observed between the age groups with a disproportionately high case fatality rate in the elderly subpopulation (<1% in <64yearold, 8.0% in 70\u2013 79yearold, and 14.8% in >80yearold subjects).1 Already at the start of the pandemic, it was obvious that effective vaccines will be the ultimate tool to control the COVID19 pandemic and bring societies back to normality. So, science excelled with the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) virus genome being sequenced on January 11, the active substance, mRNA1273, synthesized on January 13, 2020.2 By December 2020, with an unprecedented speed of less than a year, the mRNA1273 and the BNT162 (Comirnaty) vaccine were developed and granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States.2,3 In April 2020, the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA) discussed aspects for COVID19 therapeutic developments, including clinical trials, realworld evidence (RWE), and compassionate use. They expressed the need for robust evidence to establish safety and efficacy for the proposed medicines, leading to timely regulatory decisions and thus guiding clinicians in defining the best treatment options for COVID19 to serve the patients\u2019 needs in the fastest fashion possible.4 In support of the EUA, the pivotal clinical evidence was generated in large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in an idealworld setting, in the broad adult population, with prevention as the primary end point (starting in July 2020).2 Due to the limited availability of the first two authorized COVID19 vaccines, the United States and almost all other countries prioritized the elderly in the vaccination process. This decision was based on modeling approaches revealing that mortality is minimized in scenarios where the subpopulation with the highest risk of COVID19related deaths is vaccinated first, already established for influenza vaccinations. Unfortunately, in a pandemic with such high mortality, there is an evidence\u2013 time dilemma; during the clinical evidence generation, the death toll continues to rise in the real world. Knowing that the second wave is often bigger than the first and was expected to start in autumn 2020 and last until spring 2021 further emphasizes the limited time. Indeed, emergencies and crises often act as",

    "abstract": "I was named Editor-in-Chief of World\u2019s Poultry Science Journal, beginning 1 June 2021. I would like to thank the Board of Directors of the World\u2019s Poultry Science Association for their confidence in me and for entrusting the journal to my care. It is a great honour to serve the association in this capacity. I would also like to thank the previous Editors-inChief, Dr. Lucy Waldron and Dr. Juliet Roberts, for their assistance as I transitioned into my new role as Editor-in-Chief of the journal. Again, this is a great honour for me, and I sincerely hope that my performance lives up to the trust placed in me by the board. I have good news to share concerning many metrics for World\u2019s Poultry Science Journal. The 2020 Journal Citation Reports were released, and I am pleased to report that World\u2019s Poultry Science Journal has seen its Impact Factor increase from 1.364 in 2018 to 1.802 in 2019 to 2.915 in 2020. This increase was due in part to a change in the method of impact factor calculation. Clarivate adjusted the time for inclusion of content for the calculation from the issue date to the online publication date. World\u2019s Poultry Science Journal is published online by Taylor and Francis prior to the issue date. The Impact Factor for many journals increased as a result of this change. In addition, the average number of days from article acceptance to online publication for the journal decreased from 73 days in 2019, to 54 days in 2020, to 36 days year-to-date for 2021. Thus, the change in publishers to Taylor and Francis and the shift to earlier online publication helped to increase the impact factor of the journal. Importantly, World\u2019s Poultry Science Journal also moved up in the rankings and is now ranked number 12 out of 63 journals in the Agriculture, Dairy & Animals Science category (previously 15/63). In my opinion, this relative ranking is more important than Impact Factor. I want to commend the Board of Directors for selecting Taylor and Francis to publish our journal and the team at Taylor and Francis for their efforts to decrease the time to publication and to market and increase readership of the journal worldwide. Finally, I want to thank the two previous Editors-in-Chief, Dr. Lucy Waldron and Dr. Juliet Roberts, for all of their efforts in building the journal to where it is today. I look forward to serving the World\u2019s Poultry Science Association as Editor-in-Chief for World\u2019s Poultry Science Journal. My goal is to continue to increase readership and to make the journal even more relevant to poultry scientists and the poultry industries worldwide.",

    "title": "Gottfried Konecny: From draftsman to Professor emeritus \u2013 75 years of involvement in photogrammetry and remote sensing",
    "abstract": "This special issue is dedicated to Prof. Gottfried Konecny (see Figure 1), the former president of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) on the occasion of his 90 birthday, which he celebrated in good health and spirits in June 2020 (see Figure 2). A visionary leader and missionary of global topographic mapping, a world scientist and a world citizen who restlessly built and continues to build sustainable bridges between different generations and different peoples of the globe and a true pioneer of photogrammetry and remote sensing, Konecny has shaped our field of research and development over the last 75 years in ways second to none. He also has a very special connection to China, which prompted the Editor-in-Chief of Geo-spatial Information Science to suggest this journal as a very good place to publish this special issue. As the successor of Prof. Konecny at the Institute of Photogrammetry and GeoInformation of Leibniz University Hannover, it is with great honor, joy and thankfulness that Christian Heipke accepted the invitation to be guest editor of this special issue, together with Deren Li. Before presenting the contents of this issue, let us give a brief account of the life and professional achievements of Gottfried Konecny. While he is indeed one of the most well-known personalities in our fields, in particular the younger generation might not be fully familiar with his remarkable career. Gottfried Konecny was born in 1930 in Troppau, Czechoslovakia, to German parents. He started his involvement with mapping when he became a draftsman in 1945, 1 year before moving to Bavaria with his family, in 1946. Between 1950 and 1957, he studied Surveying Engineering at TU Munich and in between he completed a M.Sc. degree in Geodetic Sciences at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, under the supervision of Prof. Frederick J. Doyle, after having been awarded a US Government Fulbright Scholarship. In 1959, he obtained a PhD degree from TU Munich with a thesis on aerotriangulation with convergent imagery, supervised by Prof. Richard Finsterwalder. From 1959 to 1971, he was first Assistant Professor and since 1966 Full Professor and Head of Department at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, Canada, where he was instrumental in developing the first Geomatics Program in North America, which quickly became a role model across the English speaking world, and served as a blue print e.g. at the University of Cape Town in Africa and the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. On the scientific level he greatly contributed to the early development of line scanners and, in particular, to analytical photogrammetry and analytical plotters. Project work led him across the world, we only mention here the National Geographic Society Expedition to Mt. Kennedy, where Konecny served as Chief Surveyor and the photogrammetric survey of the Idikki Dam in Kerala, India. In 1966/67, he was with NASA in Houston during a sabbatical, mapping about 20 lunar landing sites for the Apollo Programme. In 1971, he returned to Germany to take up the Chair at the Institute of Photogrammetry and Engineering Surveys at the (now) Leibniz University Hannover. His major activities comprised the development of remote sensing in Europe. He was the Project Scientist of the first photogrammetric mapping project from space in the world, the Metric Camera, which flew on board the Space Shuttle Columbia from 28 November to 8 December 1983, obtaining a stereoscopic coverage of 10% of the Earth landmass. Another topic of major interest to Konecny was topographic mapping for sustainable development, in particular for less favored areas of the world, which directly led him to bring together photogrammetry, remote sensing and geospatial information systems. As always, he did not only suggest and analyze new ways of mapping, but also pushed for their introduction into work in practice. One such activity he was involved in was the KUDAMS Project to set up an Integrated Urban Geographic Information System in Kuwait, involving control surveys, photogrammetry, digital mapping and GIS, between 1980 and 1990. From 1976 to 1992, he was a member of the ISPRS Council and was responsible for the ISP Congress in Hamburg in 1980. He was instrumental in including remote sensing into the name and the activities of the society, thus transforming ISP to ISPRS. From 1984 to 1988 he served as ISPRS president. Since 1992, he is an ISPRS Honorary Member and has continued to work for the goals of the society in various roles until today. Currently, he serves as Vice Chair of working group WG IV/2 entitled Global Status of Mapping and Geospatial Database Updating.

    "title": "Analysis of the dynamics of the publication activity of the university in terms of employee categories",
    "abstract": "Introduction. In recent years, the goal of the state policy in the field of science and higher education was to make the universities occupy competing positions in international assessment systems, including scientific potential. Therefore, the universities need constructive solutions able to ensure the growth of the corresponding indicators. The purpose of the research is to analyze the dynamics of the publication activity of the university staff. Materials and methods. Data on the number of publications of university employees in the world's leading scientometric databases Web of Science and Scopus for the period from 2000-2020 served as the research materials. The study used classification, descriptive statistics and comparative data analysis. Research results. The categories of the teaching staff were determined, which to a greater extent affect the publication activity of the institution as a whole. As a result of a comparative analysis, all employees were divided into four categories according to the type of work (full-time teaching staff, external part-time workers, internal part-time workers and non-teaching staff), as well as into 6 groups depending on the number of publications (\"0\", \"1-2\", \"3-4\",\"5-6\",\"7-8\", \"> 9\"). The probabilities were calculated and matrices of statistical estimates of the transitions of employees of various categories from one group to another for each status were formed (the employees who continue to work at the university, newly hired or dismissed during the year). It was revealed that the drivers of scientific activity are the full-time teaching staff, except for those included in the group \"0\". Discussion and conclusion. The obtained matrices of transition probabilities will form the basis for modeling the number of employees in various groups and predicting the total number of publications of an institution. As a result, it will be possible not only to predict the total number of articles of the university while maintaining current trends, but also to consider various management scenarios in order to improve efficiency and meet the goals of the institution. This will help universities not only conduct self-analysis, but also manage the performance indicators of the institutions and departments, in terms of the growth of publication activity results.",

    "title": "African Rangelands and Pastoralism in a changing continent: Perspectives and Opportunities",
    "abstract": "iii Eighty-five years ago, Africa was described as a land of promise because it provided an immense opportunity for maximum return in the minimum time (Olaniyan 2000). It was treated this way because it was considered more for its deposits of natural wealth and less for its potential for settlement or as a destination market for goods and services produced in Europe and elsewhere (Le Clair 1937). For over 50 years, this narrative held ground but in the last 20 years, perception has shifted with Africa becoming a destination market and a growth opportunity creator, whilst holding ground as a resource provider (Sy 2016). These externally driven perceptions are shifting how key natural resources on the continent are viewed, used and managed. Accordingly, contestations are emerging especially around the environmental\u2013demographic realities. This is because of the emphasis currently placed on continuous economic growth requiring more resource inputs. This will ultimately lead to increased natural resources conflict (Abbink 2018). The exploitative narrative over Africa had become pervasive with respect to the categorisation and valuation of its natural resources. Accordingly, despite covering 43% of the continent\u2019s land surface, rangelands have been subjected to a relatively negative narrative being described as undeveloped areas (Kratli 2010), and centers of degradation, erosion, desertification, droughts, famine and conflict (Mart\u00ednez-Valderrama and Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez 2023; Twinomuhangi et al. 2023). Such negative narratives influenced the kinds of intervention in rangelands, confining these large swaths of land to conservation areas such as national parks and game reserves (Jones 2006; Cavanagh et al. 2020), constraining livestock to species such as goats (Doro 2023), and expropriating lands from the Indigenous Peoples (Homewood et al. 2009; Guyo 2017). However, more recently, ecologists and economists have revisited the place of rangelands in the continent to provide alternative perspectives on the importance of these natural resources (Vetter 2013). Current evidence counteracts previous notions that African rangelands and pastoralism are unproductive and mismanaged systems (Liniger and Studer 2019). The contribution of rangelands to the livelihoods of African people is considerable and diverse. Most of the continent\u2019s livestock providing diverse products including meat and milk produced from the rangelands (Holechek et al. 2017). Additionally, rangelands are increasingly recognised for their diverse role in the provision of ecosystem services (Ruvuga et al. 2019; Gatwaza and Wang 2023), including carbon sequestration (Denboba 2022) and other valuable provisions. As the population in Africa has grown rapidly over the last three decades and is projected to reach 2.5 billion people by 2050, food demand has also grown and will continue to rise (Dorin 2017). Rangelands have often been the frontiers for agricultural expansion and urban development, and land use conversion pressure is higher in existing rangelands, often with high population densities (Schlecht et al. 2020). Such patterns of land use change are causing inflexibility and restricting livestock mobility in traditional rangeland use centred around livestock herding (Feldt et al. 2020). Owing to these pressures, land tenure and land use policy, including land privatisation (Godde et al. 2020), sedentarisation, and conversion to other land uses, have become increasingly prevalent in the rangelands (Byakagaba et al. 2018). These changes are reorienting the livelihoods of the people domiciled in many African rangeland areas. Increasing global connections via trade and investment are leading to improved better infrastructure and increased accessibility of previously remote rangelands, thereby contributing to large-scale transformations of the traditional territories of rangeland-based people (Lind et al. 2020). Following the increasing global recognition of the momentous dynamics that are globally reshaping rangelands and biodiversity, the Government of Mongolia proposed in 2019 that the United Nations (UN) declare an International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists (IYRP) in 2026. This proposal was subsequently endorsed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and approved by the United Nations General Assembly on 15 March 2022. The intention of celebrating the IYRP is to raise the profile of rangelands and pastoral societies worldwide and to enhance recognition of their valuable contribution to the economy, environment, society, and culture at a the local, national, and global level. Under the global IYRP coalition, African researchers decided to develop a special issue of the African Journal of Range & Forage Science to provide evidence on diverse topical issues converging around the theme rangelands and pastoralism in a changing continent. This African-led special issue presents emerging evidence for a regional perspective of dynamics that are reshaping the perception, valuation, development, and management of the continent\u2019s rangelands.",

    "abstract": "The new science of weather event attribution is unlikely to make useful contributions to adaptation funding decisions. International funds created largely for funding climate adaptation programs and projects in developing countries were first legally established through the seventh session of the Conference of the Parties (COP-7) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) held in 2001 at Marrakesh. In 2009, at COP-15 in Copenhagen, delegates \u201ctook note\u201d of a pledge from developed countries to commit U.S. $30 billion for the period 2010\u20132012, ramping up to $100 billion per annum by 2020, to support a mixture of climate adaptation and mitigation activities in developing countries. International adaptation finance has therefore been, and continues to be, a significant political issue for the FCCC and for international institutions, such as the World Bank, the Global Environment Facility, and regional development banks (1). Yet governance arrangements and allocation principles for these climate adaptation funds remain both underdeveloped and politically contested (2, 3). A Green Climate Fund for disbursing such funds was established at COP-16 in Canc\u00fan, and a Transitional Committee is currently developing operational documents for the fund to be adopted at COP-17 in Durban, South Africa, later this year.",

    "abstract": "To address the need for a diverse and capable workforce in advanced digital services and resources, the Shodor Education Foundation has been coordinating an undergraduate student program for the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). The name of the program is EMPOWER (Expert Mentoring Producing Opportunities for Work, Education, and Research). The goal of the program is to engage a diverse group of undergraduate students in the work of XSEDE, matching them with faculty and staff mentors who have projects that make use of XSEDE services and resources or that otherwise prepare students to use these types of services and resources. Mentors have coordinated projects in computational science and engineering research in many fields of study as well as systems and user support. Students work for a semester, quarter, or summer at a time and can participate for up to a year supported by stipends from the program, at different levels depending on experience. The program has run for 11 iterations from summer 2017 through fall 2020. The 111 total student participants have been 28% female and 31% underrepresented minority, and they have been selected from a pool of 272 total student applicants who have been 31% female and 30% underrepresented minority. We are pleased that the selection process does not favor against women and minorities but would also like to see these proportions increase. At least one fourth of the students have presented their work in articles or at conferences, and multiple credit the program with moving them towards graduate study or otherwise advancing them in their careers.",

The patient was hospitalized and treated at a medical college hospital for COVID-19 moderate illness, which was identified clinically and confirmed by RT-PCR positive and HRCT of the chest. He improved immensely without complications and was discharged from the hospital on 28/4/2021 following a 14-day hospital stay on rivaroxamine 10 mg daily, vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc. The cavernous sinus (CS) is a pair of cerebral dural venous sinuses found in the middle cranial fossa on each side of the sellaturcica. The cavernous sinus contains the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves, as well as the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the fifth cranial nerve and the internal carotid artery with its surrounding sympathetic plexus. CST related with COVID-19 is becoming more common, however therapy is problematic since the appropriate anticoagulant and length of therapy are unknown. We are now treating the patient with subcutaneous low molecular heparin. Introduction The world is facing the second wave of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which is the most troublesome challenge to public health. COVID19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV2) started in Hubei Province, People\u2019s Republic of China in December 2019 [1] . The virus has since spread globally rapidly and World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 pandemic on 11th March 2020. The second wave is running and nobody knows where we are in the course of this disease. It becomes a significant challenge for the public health, science, and medical sectors [2] . COVID-19 is primarily the disease of respiratory tract and initially the mortalityis related to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but more and more understanding of this disease in course of time, it revealed that COVID-19caused an inflammatory response with severe systemic complications like stroke, acute liver failure and acute renal failure [3] . Neurologic complications are frequent in patients with COVID-19, occurring in 36% to 65% of hospitalized patients [4, 5] .

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades revolutionary progress in plant biology became possible by focusing resources on a single plant reference system, Arabidopsis thaliana. After the completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence in the year 2000, a coordinated multinational effort was launched to \u201cdetermine the function of every gene in Arabidopsis\u201d by the year 2010. \n \nPart of this effort was the German Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Network (AFGN). Established in 2001, AFGN was continuously supported for 9 years by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Over 85 German researchers contributed to AFGN, partially in close bilateral collaboration with scientists of the NSF-funded Arabidopsis 2010 initiative. \n \nWhile the ambitious goal of determining the function of every Arabidopsis gene has not yet been fully achieved, the Arabidopsis genome is now one of the best annotated and serves as the gold standard for plant and other genomes. A large and international community has established novel methods, toolkits and genomic resources, such as sequence-indexed mutant collections and comprehensive and easily accessible \u201comics-scale datasets,\u201d ranging from transcriptome over proteome to the metabolome. One prominent example is the AtGenExpress data set, which was partially realized by AFGN scientists and serves as the gold standard in microarray-based transcriptomics. \n \nThe Arabidopsis 2010 program evolved from studying the functions of single genes and gene families to comprehensive systems-wide analyses of functional networks, thereby paving the way from descriptive to predictive plant science. Progress does not stop here\u2014in the near future, the genomes of 1000 Arabidopsis strains and accessions will become available, which will make it possible to exploit existing natural variation for addressing fundamental questions in ecology and evolutionary biology in an unprecedented manner. Further, due to ease of transformation and existing genetic and genomic resources, Arabidopsis will likely serve as a chassis for synthetic plant biology, an emerging field and challenge for the next decade of plant research (EU 2020 Vision of Plant Science, 2008; An International Model for the Future of Plant Science, 2010). \n \nThis special issue of Frontiers in Plant Physiology will provides 20 examples from the ongoing research of AFGN and Arabidopsis 2010 members on how focusing on a single plant model system has impacted and revolutionized many fields of plant research and it will provide an outlook on the upcoming challenges and fields of research for the next decade of Arabidopsis research.",

    "title": "Author reply to Weaving et al.: comment on: \u2018A contemporary multi-modal mechanical approach to training monitoring in elite professional soccer: a mathematical problem?\u2019",
    "abstract": "Dear Editor, We thank the authors of this particular paper for their constructive comments on our manuscript first published within Science and Medicine in football in 2017 (Owen et al. 2017) and welcome the opportunity to address some of the points raised. Overall, we agree with the points made and we welcome further debate within this research area. Furthermore, we take great satisfaction from the discussion the manuscript has caused within the practical and academic communities across professional team sport codes. We also hope these debates will allow for the opportunity for future research within other team sport codes across this multi-modal approach to monitoring. The main concerns raised by Weaving et al. (2020) relate to the collinearity of specific external loading measures that are provided from GPS micro sensor technology within the practical setting daily. We do not disagree with the comments on this fact; indeed, extensive reviews and additional manuscripts across the training load literature have reported on this issue across the preceding three-year period post the initial publication of the manuscript into multi-modal models in 2017. Additionally, while practically through mediums like social media and podcasts, there may have been an increase in interest within the topic area; academically, one additional research manuscript has been published in this area (Owen et al. 2019), highlighting the need for increased debate and refinement of the multi-modal approach originally published in 2017. This research, we hope, will incorporate the specific statistical requirements that may reduce the highlighted collinearity within the original model proposed by Owen and colleagues in 2017. It should be noted by academics that previous literature has reported on the disconnect between practitioners and academics with respect to embedded sports science research (Malone et al. 2019). The research reported that while research collaborations were mainly formed to improve team performance, academics ranked journal articles with increased importance, while practitioners rated one-to-one communication as more preferential. Furthermore, potential barriers were found in terms of staff buy-in, with practitioners reporting a preference for \u2018fast\u2019 type research. Overall, practitioners preferred \u2018fast\u2019 informal research dissemination compared to the \u2018slow\u2019 quality control approach of academics. The above highlights how research over time can improve any methodological issues associated with specific measures, but also how practitioners are concerned with the here and now, and getting staff buy-in through open communication channels with backroom teams and management within a high-performance setting. From its inception, the multi-modal approach was created to condense down specific external loading reports for applied practitioners into two key variables of volume and intensity represented by specific percentage values, in order to allow for a more simplistic process of external load dissemination between performance staff and technical staff within soccer. We acknowledge, however, that not all models are without limitations, based on additional research within the area of ratios, that these data within the multi-model model may mathematically scale across specific players depending on their performance within the training and match-play (Lolli et al. 2018). However, the main purpose of the creation of the external training load measures within the model was to provide an approach to practitioners that would engage technical staff of elite sporting organisations who anecdotally have limited interest in engaging with sport science professionals due to the ever-increasing data within the applied field. We feel that since the model\u2019s inception it has allowed for increased communication between staff members within high-performance teams across multiple sporting codes based. However, we acknowledge that specific improvements are required to the model, based on the constructive feedback from Weaving et al. (2020). The original model (Owen et al. 2017) did not include a PCA but it should be noted that the original paper was developed to show-case a concept for practitioners with respect to external training load analysis. It was expected that this model would be modified by readers to fit their contextual environments. For example, through \u2018fast\u2019 informal research dissemination, the authors of the original manuscript have observed practitioners within team sport settings applying average match-running performance within the model, replacing the average maximal performance measures within the original model in addition to completing PCA on measures and selecting the most appropriate measures to include within their specific context. However, to date, these different multi-model iterations have not been published within peer-reviewed journals. As such, we hope that through these two communications (Weaving et al. 2020; Owen et al. 2017), there is an increase in analysis of the multi-modal concept within team sports. Like all new concepts within sport science and science, these are subject to peer review analysis resulting in limitations being discussed and debated over-time; these discussions then result in new research that ultimately progresses the topic area. The original model was aimed at practitioners who were concerned about reducing the gap of understanding between training and game external loading reports for technical staff through a data reductionist approach that resulted in the creation of two targeted training measures namely: percentage volume SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN FOOTBALL 2022, VOL. 6, NO. 2, 270\u2013271 https://doi.org/10.1080/24733938.2021.1942539",

Particular thanks go to technical program chair (TPC) and guest editor Charles Kessel for his efforts, not only in guiding an excellent program, but in working with Fusion Science and Technology (FS&T) through the publication process for this special issue. Without his work this special issue would not have been possible. In the long history of the TOFE conference series, due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, this 2020 iteration is the first to have been conducted online. It was embedded as part of the 2020 ANS Virtual Winter Meeting, held November 16\u201319, 2020. Nevertheless, the high technical level of the online presentations and the question and answer sessions was unprecedented. The editors of this special issue share the opinion of TPC Chuck Kessel on the fundamental role of the TOFE conference in the agenda of presenting new frontiers and challenges of fusion technology development. With TOFE 2020, we have witnessed a strong interest in fusion problematics from a young generation of researchers and scientists. To encourage submissions to FS&T from the young, talented researchers, we have established a section of student competition papers for this special issue. In our future FS&T issues, we are continuing to pursue this aim of boosting the scientific careers of young researchers by providing them recognition in the fusion community through publication in the journal. By this strategy, we hope to arouse interest in the young generation and motivate them to participate in the exciting subject of fusion science and technology. Fusion technology now sees new facilities and growing research activities every year. This year\u2019s TOFE technical program demonstrates the growth of our field of study. It was filled with a range of presentations, from neutronics analysis to the tritium fuel cycle, enabling technologies, plasmafacing components, liquid metals, fusion materials, safety systems, blanket systems, and private enterprise. It was a great pleasure to read this work, and we anticipate learning about progress and new discoveries again at the next TOFE meeting. On a practical note, this special issue of FS&T is arranged by category to make finding related papers simpler, as noted in the table of contents. In order, the sections are system-level design and safety; large component design, manufacturing, and analysis; magnet design and analysis; divertor heat management; disruption mitigation via pellet injection; liquid metal analysis; fusion neutronics; tritium systems; and the aforementioned student paper competition selections. The contents of this special issue reflect the actual state of fusion energy development. This issue encompasses many subjects, overviewed in the foreword from TPC Chuck Kessel.

    "abstract": "Background: How to choose proper lipoarabinomannan (LAM)-testing assays for different tuberculosis (TB) patients baffles clinicians seriously. This work assessed the performance of all reported LAM-testing assays in various clinical situations, aiming to identify eligibility of each assay and offer guidance for clinicians. \n \nMethods: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for cohort studies, cross-sectional studies or randomized controlled trials which assessed LAM-testing assays performance until August 23, 2020. Two authors independently collected participant characteristics, assay performance and reference standards. Risk of bias was evaluated by QADAS-2. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled by a bivariate mixed model. Heterogeneity was evaluated by Cochran\u2019s Q test and inconsistency square (I2). [Register number: INPLASY202180020]. \n \nFindings: Ninety-seven articles, covering 16 different assays, 45,679 participants and 8 sample types, were included. Considering to designs, 97 studies were divided into 144 trials and then 5 groups [lateral flow assay group: 72 trials; enzyme-linked immune assay (ELISA) group: 47 trials; electrochemiluminescence (ECL) group: 8 trials; immune dot group: 6 trials and other assays group: 11 trials].Among all assays, ECL exhibited an excellent performance [sensitivity: 65%; specificity: 92%; area under curve (AUC): 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82-0.88], but high heterogeneity (I 2 =93%). For TB-AIDS patients, ECL\u2019s advantage was apparent (sensitivity: 78%; specificity: 88%; AUC: 0.88), and further expanded when taking urine as sample (sensitivity: 90%; specificity: 89%; AUC: 0.95). ELISA showed a preference for Asian and African, and such preference was also shown in African with positive smear (sensitivity: 80%; specificity: 88%; AUC: 0.91). \n \nInterpretation: ECL was recommended for TB-AIDS patients, especially taking urine as sample. For African with positive smear, ELISA was recommended as an additional detection to offer more reliable evidence. According to patient characteristics, selecting LAM-testing assays was crucial to enhance detection rate and should be brought to the forefront. \n \nFunding: National Science & Technology Pillar Program during the 13th Five-year Plan Period; \n1\u00b73\u00b75 project for disciplines of excellence\u2013Clinical Research Incubation Project, West China \nHospital, Sichuan University; Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province pillar \nprogram. \n \nDeclaration of Interest: None to declare.",

    "abstract": "An annual scientific practical conference \u201cNatural science education in a comprehensive school \u2013 2019\u201d took place in Aukstaitian town Kupiskis. It is known that Kupiskis is a town in the North East of Lithuania, in the eastern edge of Middle Lithuania lowland. The time of the conference is traditional \u2013 the second part of April, i.e., from 25th to 27th.. It is worth to remember that a conference \u201ccame travelling\u201d from Little Lithuania (Lithuania Minor) to Aukstaitia (Lithuanian Highland) (In 2018, the 24th conference took place in Silut\u0117 Martynas Jankus Basic school). Thus, a conference is still \u201ctravelling\u201d.\nOn the first conference day, plenary reports and two section works took place. A useful plenary report was made by Eugenija Rudnickaite from Vilnius university. A fossil fuel collection was discussed and presented; some practical tips were given about the application of the collection for natural science education. The second report was made by dr. Agnaldo Arroio. The report was very actual because the actualities of modern media application in education were discussed, also there was a discussion on natural science literacy formation questions. The third report which was made by Vilnius university lecturer dr. Rita Makarskait\u0117-Petkevi\u010dien\u0117, focused on the current natural science questions in primary school. The fourth report, which was made by Latvian university professor Andris Broks, completed the plenary meeting. As always, the professor analysed methodological, systemic natural science education questions. The latter report was focussed on the changes /alteration in nature, society, education and so on. \nMost of the conference reports were presented in the form of articles and published in the conference proceedings. One can find full texts in the database at: http://oaji.net/journal-archive-stats.html?number=1984&year=2019&issue=14379\nTwo conference days passed in the blink of an eye. Totally, 66 participants were enrolled in it. The work of the conference went smoothly, therefore it is worthy to thank all the members of the conference organisational committee, and especially the pro-gymnasium administration. \nNatural science education \u201cjourney\u201d continues. The 26th conference will take place on 24th -25th April 2020 in Trakai Vytautas Magnus gymnasium. This gymnasium is the main partner of another conference. So, from Aukstaitia we move to Trakai, a city of Vilnius district, surrounded by lakes. What is more, Trakai is the cultural capital of Lithuania, 2020. \nKeywords: national conference, science education, science and technological education movement.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to: Assess the need for instruments for Higher Order Thinking Skill (HOTS) questions based on geographic literacy in the social studies subject on Indonesia's maritime and agricultural potential; Material on Indonesia's maritime and agricultural potential is studied in class VIII at the junior high school education unit. The needs analysis study conducted in this study took place at the Insan Cendekia Boarding School Sukoharjo Middle School (ICBS Middle School). This research was designed as a development research model that refers to the Borg and Gall model which has been modified according to the needs and limitations of the research. The literacy concepts used as a reference for researchers are Edelson's three geographic lit eracy concepts, namely interaction, interconnection, and implications. Taking the Edelson concept adapts to the cognition level of junior high school students which is simpler and in accordance with the learning objectives. The research subjects were class VIII students of SMP Insan Cendekia Al Mujtaba Sukoharjo for the academic year 2022/2023. The research sample was determined using startified random sampling. The data collection process used in the study used item analysis, questionnaires, and interviews. The results showed: 1) Based on a needs analysis with an analysis of 50 Final Semester Assessment (PAS) items in 2019 and 50 Mid Semester Assessment (PTS) items in 2020, 94% of the 2019 PAS items and 84% of the PTS items in 2019 2020 is still a matter of Lower Order Thinking Skills (LOTS). 2) As many as 88% of teacher respondents who are members of the 2022/2023 Social Studies Subject Teacher Consultation (MGMP) agree that the development of HOTS question instruments is very important and needed as a reference in preparing assessment instruments. 3) Important and necessary training in the preparation of HOTS-based question instruments needed by teachers at SMP ICBS. The conclusions of this study indicate that 1) The development of instruments at the HOTS level is important and needs to be developed in order to stimulate the learning process and students' critical thinking skills; 2) It is important to develop geographic literacy based HOTS questions in the process and evaluation of learning to improve critical thinking skills in spatial concepts on Indonesian maritime and agricultural potential in class VIII students of SMP ICBS. 3) The form of the researcher's recommendation as a form of self-development and improvement of the professional abilities of ICBS Middle School teachers needs and is important to hold HOTS question preparation training.",

With students themselves as co-creators of solutions to problems of persistence, core Network activities include iterative testing of improvements to practice, development of a statewide network to support student success, and capacity building to ensure sustainability.\u00a0\u00a0 Study methods include surveys and interviews, observation of Network activities, document review, social network analysis, and tracking of student progress. Key findings suggest rapid Network expansion, establishment of core processes to support workgroups, provision of Network-wide training in improvement science, and successful facilitation of summer immersive research experiences for targeted students (in-person in 2019 and virtually in 2020). Early outcomes include statistically significant improvements in students\u2019 STEM efficacy and STEM identity following summer immersive experiences, and improved survey scores indicating progress through iterative testing cycles. Early persistence data from participating students is less promising. But since the purpose of the Network is to learn how to help students persist, members continue their efforts to improve.",

    "title": "A Few Steps Toward Improving Glaucoma Diagnostic Accuracy and Understanding Intraocular Pressure.",
    "abstract": "Glaucoma afflicts more than 64 million people worldwide with projected rates increasing to 76 million in 2020 and more than 110 million by the year 2040. It is the third leading cause of blindness and is responsible for substantial visual impairment. The field defects that result from glaucoma significantly impact vision-related quality of life. Glaucoma patients diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease are at much greater risk of going blind, placing a priority on early detection when the disease is often asymptomatic. Glaucoma is defined by characteristic changes to the tissues of the optic nerve and inner retina. Imaging technologies have significantly improved our ability to diagnose glaucoma and monitor its progression. Improving the diagnostic accuracy of these technologies is an active area of research. With advances in measurement resolution and repeatability, extremely small changes in tissue thickness over time can now be detected. The result is that differentiating the presence of disease from structural variability within the normal population and defining clinically significant progression are now challenges. Intraocular pressure has long been identified as a significant risk factor for the development of glaucoma, and it remains the primary target of therapy. Despite this, much is still unknown about the physiologic and pathologic mechanisms that modulate intraocular pressure. As basic science, animal, and clinical research continues to expand our understanding of intraocular pressure, new drugs and surgical devices have been developed to reduce its levels. The current feature issue of Optometry and Vision Science addresses some key questions in the diagnosis and management of glaucoma. It proposes approaches that use imaging technologies to improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. It highlights some of the factors that influence intraocular pressure and its measurement in both the laboratory and clinic settings. It discusses mechanisms involved in angle closure and investigates a potential prognostic clinical test. Finally, it reviews the challenges ofmedical glaucoma therapy and the role of new and less invasive surgical techniques. Studies have shown that central vision is affected more often than previously thought in early stages of glaucoma. This has led to a push for the use of functional tests with greater sampling of the central visual field, such as 10\u20132 test protocols, and structural assessments of the macula. The use of macular asymmetry analyses to diagnose glaucoma is limited by the high variability in thicknesses within normal subjects. Alluwimi and colleagues detailed a novel macular asymmetry analysis that reduced betweensubject variability with the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of imaging devices. Loss of the nerve fiber layer and macular inner retinal tissue is not specific to glaucoma and is seen in other common ocular diagnoses such as branch retinal artery occlusion. Sullivan-Mee et al.",

    "title": "Gliosarcomas: A Rare Case Report at Viet Duc University Hospital and Review of the Literature",
    "abstract": "Gliosarcoma is a rare biphasic subtype of glioblastoma with the poor prognosis, principally affects adults; males are more frequently affected, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.8/1. Gliosarcomas are usually located in the cerebral hemispheres, involving the temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes in decreasing order of frequency. Rarely, gliosarcomas occur in the posterior fossa, lateral ventricles, or spinal cord. A case study: A 32-year-old woman presented with persistent nausea and headache. The preoperative diagnosis was Ependymoma in the right lateral ventricle of the brain. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor followed by external radiotherapy, and chemotherapy treatment. Histologic description: The tumor was made up of spindle cells with hyperchromic large nuclei and pink cytoplasm intermingled with large cells with markedly pleomorphic nuclei and abundant cytoplasm along with prominent mitotic activity. Tumour cells revealed positive staining for Ki67 (25%), Oligo2 (focal), GFAP (focal), SMA (focal); negative immunoreactivity for EMA, CD34, Bcl-2, TTF1. Pathological diagnosis: Gliosarcoma, grade IV. Conclusions: Gliosarcoma is an extremely rare neoplasm with an aggressive biological behavior. In terms of histopathology, gliosarcomas are characterized by a biphasic tissue pattern with alternating areas displaying glial and mesenchymal differentiation. \u00a0 \nKeywords \nGliosarcoma, glioblastoma multiforme, brain neoplasm. \nReferences \n[1] World Healh Organization, WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 69372 Lyon Cedex 08, France, 2016.

    "title": "Productivity of seed potatoes with local application of phosphorous and potassium fertilisers",
    "abstract": "Ukraine occupies a leading position in potato production, being one of the top three producing countries and ranks second in the world in terms of potato consumption per capita, second only to Belarus \u2013 139 kg per year per 1 person, with a global average of approximately 33 kg/person/year. According to the U\u0421AB, in recent years, the area under potatoes has increased by 2.7% to 1,325 thousand hectares. However, the average yield over the past three years was at the level of 15.8 t/ha. In some advanced farms in Ukraine, the yield reaches 30-40 t/ha due to the introduction of scientific findings into production. However, in general, in Ukraine, the potential for the economic productivity of potatoes now remains unused to the full extent. Potato plants are demanding in terms of the availability of nutrients in the soil. They should be in an accessible form and in sufficient quantity. This is largely due to the biological characteristics of potatoes. The effectiveness of mineral fertilisers depends on the methods and quality of their application. The conventional method of fertilisation involves spreading fertilisers on the surface and then covering them with soil. As a result of the uneven placement of fertiliser granules in the soil layer, nutrients transition to a form inaccessible to plants, which leads to uneven development and maturation of tubers. Therefore, one of the ways to improve potato nutrition, reduce nutrient losses, and obtain high, stable crop yields is to apply mineral fertilisers locally to the root system of plants. Local application of phosphorus leads to its better availability throughout the growing season, which ensures accelerated growth and development of roots and shoots, and the formation of an optimal number of tubers. Local placement of potassium improves its availability and provides enhanced synthesis and transport of carbohydrates in plants, increases the absorption of moisture and nutrients by roots, strengthens their resistance to diseases, and improves the quality of tubers. The purpose was to examine the efficiency of using phosphorus and potassium in various methods and norms of fertiliser application and to establish the effect on the productivity of seed potatoes. The studies were conducted in the field experiment by the Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Quality of Plant Products named in honour of O.I. Dushechkin of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine on the territory of Biotech Ltd. (Boryspil district, Kyiv region) during 2019-2020. An early-maturing Tyras variety was chosen for the research. The area of the sown plot was 495 m2, accounting plot \u2013 312 m2. The experiment is repeated four times. The placement of options was systematic. As a result of the experiment, it was identified that local application of phosphorous and potassium fertilisers provided such a level of the yield of potatoes of the Tyras variety, which was not inferior to the option with a spreading method. The yield increase in variants with local application ranged from 0.6 t/ha to 2.9 t/ha, depending on the norm. Application of local fertiliser with the P60K135 norm caused the highest yield of seed potatoes among the variants (33.4 t/ha), and the highest yield of the seed fraction \u2013 31.6 t/ha",

    "title": "Endemicity of COVID-19 to Sub-Saharan Africa: A Review of the Past, Present and Future Risk",
    "abstract": "Background: The incidence and burden of endemic or potentially endemic infectious diseases (IDs) is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with a new disease to emerge every 8 months on average. The epidemic of preventable IDs becoming endemic to SSA serves as a stack reminder of the region\u2019s systematic failings to health security. It is more important now than ever to evaluate SSA\u2019s vulnerability to COVID-19, a global pandemic becoming endemic to the region after it perhaps gets eliminated from the other world regions. \n \nMethod: The International Health Regulations (IHR [2005]) and Global Health Security Index (GHSI) scores for SSA before COVID-19 reached the region were obtained and evaluated to assess its health security preparedness. The number of cases, deaths and stringency measures of the first year of the virus in the region were used to ascertain the possibility of the virus becoming endemic to SSA. By this, COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths of the region were obtained from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The stringency measures put in place by each country were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). Data from the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Online Network (GIDEON) was then used to evaluate the intensity and distribution of endemic or potentially endemic IDs after COVID-19 reached SSA. \n \nFindings: Before the virus reached the region, 31% and 37% of the SSA countries moderately adhered to the IHR and GHSI score respectively. The overall performance of the region in its first year of responding and containing the virus was 56% compared to a global average of 60%. For the first year period of the virus, South Africa with the highest GHSI of 54\u00b78% before the virus reached the region accounted for 55% of the total cases within the first year. Majority of the cases (48%) and deaths (55%) of the first year were recorded in the last three months when values of the stringency measures fell below 50%. For the region, the number of mortalities to cases ratio for the first wave (July 2020) was 1\u00b747:98\u00b753 compared to the second wave (February 2021) of 3\u00b754:96\u00b746. It was also observed that, an average of 222 IDs were endemic or potentially endemic to SSA after COVID-19 reached the region. \n \nInterpretation: It was revealed that there is a high possibility of devastating subsequent waves of COVID-19 and it becoming endemic to the region after assessing the stringency measures that were put in place, relative to the number of cases and deaths over the first year period. \n \nFunding: None to declare. \n \nDeclaration of Interest: None to declare.",

    "title": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and forensic pathology",
    "abstract": "As is widely known, a novel virus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, which soon spread across the globe, causing the most significant pandemic in recent years. This entity is now commonly known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emergence of this virus has had an impact on all aspects of medicine, and forensic pathology is no exception. During the past year, since the variant first emerged, much knowledge has been gained about the pathology and management of this disease, prompting much in the way of sharing information both in published and online literature and through online seminars. The majority of what is currently known regarding the pathological changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 is from the work undertaken in the early days of the Wuhan outbreak. As the disease spread across the globe, several case reports and papers describing histopathological observations have been published. It is now well recognised that an important entity of this contagious disease is diffuse alveolar damage with macrophage activation, and during the course of 2020, a high incidence of prothrombotic states was observed, leading to pulmonary embolism. However, SARS-CoV-2 pathology is not limited to the respiratory tract, with cardiac, renal and neurological entities being described. What is clear is that our understanding of the pathological consequences of the infection is still evolving, and the emergence of new strains will almost certainly pose new findings from post-mortem studies. How does this translate to forensic pathology? Whether or not a decedent shows positivity to SARSCoV-2 poses little or indeed no difficulty in cases of traumatic homicide, for example a decedent who has SARS-CoV-2 positivity but who has received fatal injuries caused by sharp-force assault. Clearly, the decedent has died soon after injury infliction, and therefore the presence of a viral infection has no relevance as to the cause of death. However, homicide forms only a portion of modern forensic pathology work, and often a forensic pathologist is asked to perform a post-mortem examination on a decedent who is believed to have died following negligent care or historic injury or who has sustained a prolonged stay in hospital following injury causation from assault or road traffic incidents. These are the cases where a sound knowledge of the current arena regarding histopathology and, to a degree, pathophysiology is paramount. It is accepted that certain groups of individuals are more susceptible to the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, irrespective of the circumstances leading to death. This becomes extremely important in cases whereby determining causal link involving historic injury is the requirement for the instruction of a forensic pathologist to perform a post-mortem examination. The general population as a whole is equally at risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, and as such, predisposing disability does not necessary increase such risk. Anecdotal accounts, case reports and population studies of previously well patients with no known comorbidities who had fatally succumbed to COVID-19 provide further difficulty in assessing the role of COVID-19, causal link and fatal outcome. One could argue, however, that the pre-existing condition, be that neglectful care resulting in significant decubitus ulcers and malnutrition, incapacity from previous neurological injury following assault or polytrauma from road traffic collision, places the decedent within the category designated as \u2018high risk\u2019, and they would therefore be more liable to a poorer prognosis and fatal outcome. A good understanding of the histopathology of COVID-19 will also assist the forensic pathologist in evaluating whether a positive ante-mortem or postmortem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result for SARS-CoV-2 has played an important role in the causation of death. Equally, pathologists conducting post-mortem examinations should be reminded of the importance of not relying upon a positive or indeed negative RT-PCR result. There should be a high suspicion of COVID-19-related pathology in those decedents where unexpected changes within the lungs are seen by either postmortem radiological or anatomical examination. A history of recent alteration in cognition, new-onset delirium or other neurological symptoms should prompt a thorough examination of the central nervous system by neuropathology to determine whether COVID-19related encephalitis is present.

Abstract This paper presents the results of storm surge simulation in the South Central region of Vietnam using the Mike 21-FM HD model. Wind pressure fields of typical storms were first identified in period of 1986-2005 using the parametric wind field model. Storm surge risk was then simulated based on the rare 10, 50 and 100-year frequency corresponding to 2030, 2050, and 2100 scenarios. Storm surge model was finally calibrated and validated using the level of water measured in the November 2009 Typhoon Mirinae and October 2013 Typhoon Nari. The results show that storm surges were consistent with water level variation and amplitude; the maximum and minimum storm surges were 2.34m in the Binh Thuan coastal area and 0.78m in the Khanh Hoa coastal area, respectively. The results of this study demonstrated the use of MIKE 21-FM HD model for the simulation of storm surges in the future plays an important role in damage risk reduction caused by storm surges.

    "abstract": "The American Antitrust Institute (AAI) has released the White Paper, Update on Digital Technology: The Failure of Merger Enforcement and Need for Reform. The new White Paper updates and expands on analysis AAI originally released in July 2019.<br><br>The widely cited 2019 AAI White Paper, The Record of Weak U.S. Merger Enforcement in Digital Technology, was the subject of AAI testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and drew attention to the acquisitive history of the five largest multinational online service or computer hardware or software companies: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft (\u201cBig Tech\u201d). It also unpacked the history of merger enforcement under Section 7 of the Clayton Act in a major segment of the digital technology sector. The White Paper concluded that, as compared to enforcement across all sectors, the rate of merger challenges in digital technology is exceptionally low.<br><br>Since then, much has happened in the digital technology sector. Big Tech has solidified its hold on the top-most slots, by market value, in the Fortune 500. Federal and state monopolization cases have been filed against Google and Facebook. Among other things, the Facebook complaints allege that acquisitions of small rivals, such as social media firms Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014), were a strategy to snuff out potential competition to maintain a monopoly in personal social networking services. The public policy debate over the dominance of Big Tech has also generated numerous proposals to remedy competitive and consumer harm, including breakups and digital market regulation. A 2020 House Judiciary Committee report examined competitive issues raised by the platforms that are at the core of many of the large digital ecosystems. Moreover, the digital ecosystems have been the subject of ongoing economic, business, and policy research, which has advanced the state of thinking over potential policy solutions to the problems they raise.<br><br>Results of AAI\u2019s updated analysis indicate that expansion by acquisition continues to be a leading method by which the large digital ecosystems grow. Enforcers can expect to see further growth that, when juxtaposed with persistent, weak merger enforcement in the sector, will likely exacerbate competition problems. Indeed, stronger merger enforcement over the last two decades would have mitigated the monopolization concerns that AAI sees now. As it stands, however, Section 2 of the Sherman Act is virtually the only antitrust tool left to combat dominance in the digital technology sector. This White Paper turns first to updating data on acquisitions by Big Tech through 2020 and merger enforcement statistics through the latest available reporting year, 2019. It then examines the implications of Big Tech\u2019s likely trajectory of further expansion through acquisition and growth in critical cloud infrastructure capability. It closes with an analysis of reforms necessary to revitalize merger enforcement in digital technology.",

    "abstract": "Dr Birgit Prodinger The COVID-19 global pandemic urges occupational scientists to examine such world events through an occupational lens. Few other events have been experienced in such a significant way across the globe and, whilst the impact and response has differed in different geographies, we have all experienced \u2013 temporarily or continuously \u2013 occupational disruption. Reflecting that global impact, the papers in this issue were submitted by authors from Europe, Africa, Australasia, and North America, providing readers with a variety of perspectives. Many educators of occupational science and/or occupational therapy took innovative approaches to their teaching and learning and required their students to examine howCOVID-19 and the public health responses impacted on their lives as students. The first three papers in this issue are examples with students from Turkey and from the US. The students in Turkey examined their time use in relation to occupational balance and temporal life satisfaction during the isolation period in May 2020 (Salar et al., 2022). Students who spent more time in study, socialising, and exercise had better occupational balance and those who spent more time watching TV had lower occupational balance. Socialising and exercise were adapted to occur within the confines of the home. To understand the impact of the pandemic on people\u2019s daily lives, it can be worthwhile to compare what people have done prior to the pandemic. Werner and Jozkowski (2022) did so in examining the time use of US students during in comparison to one year prior to the pandemic. Students used visual representations as well as lists to report on their time use. The study revealed that driving was not reported as an occupation throughout the pandemic at all. Significant changes were revealed in time spent in studying, rest, and sleep. Also studying US university students\u2019 experiences, Krishnagiri and Atler (2022) examined the adaptation of occupations, in particular social occupations, and their interaction with health and well-being in the earlier phase of the pandemic. Next to laying out how students experienced and underwent changes in occupations, the authors provide portraits of three students to illustrate the dynamics of doing, being, becoming, and belonging. Wegner et al. (2022) pivoted a student assignment to explore young adults\u2019 leisure experiences in South Africa during the pandemic. The authors then took a meta-analytic approach to synthesise and thematically analyse the findings from the student\u2019s work. Findings revealed occupational disruption to the lives of the young people during the confinement, particularly leisure and social occupations, however they adapted and developed new leisure occupations. The next group of studies explored impact of the pandemic on people living with chronic",

    "abstract": "Urban areas have a dual role in climate change\u00b7 they are major contributors to climate change as they produce more than 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and they also accept the impact of it. Urban trees have great value in urban ecosystems because of their role as carbon sinks, so they contribute to climate change mitigation. The aim of this paper is to collect data about the impact of climate change on forestry species in urban areas via the science of phenology. In recent years, via phenology, the observation and study of the effects of climate change are possible, as there appears to be a shift in the start of biological events, and also a change in their duration. These changes in the seasonal activity of plants, from time to time, are a sensitive but perfectly visible indicator of changes in the functioning of ecosystems. Phenology refers to the recording of dates in which different phases of the plant\u2019s life cycle such as budburst, flowering, dormancy, and hibernation have been observed both in species and in plant communities. Temperature, solar radiation, and water availability are the three factors that affect plant phenology. To appreciate the impact of climate change on the phenological stages of forestry species, three Phenological Monitoring Areas (PMA) were created in three urban spaces in Thessaloniki, in December 2020, within the framework of the project LIFE CliVut (Climate Value of Urban Trees) LIFE18 GIC/IT/001217. Each PMA contains 20 species (10 species of trees and 10 species of shrubs), and 100 individuals (5 individuals per species). The monitoring of the phenological stages of the forestry species was carried out throughout a year on a weekly basis according to the protocol that was created in the frame of the project taking into consideration the BBCH scale.",

    "abstract": "Publications are commonly used to evaluate the productivity and impact of research programs. Traditional metrics examine publication impact through slowly accumulating academic citations. \u201cAltmetrics\u201d are a new way to describe early publication influence in nonacademic media/community spheres (news, tweets, and blogs). Articles with significant altmetric attention make a big splash of immediate impact, whereas papers with high rates of academic citation reflect ripple effects of influence over time. Past research has found weak associations between altmetrics and academic citations. However, no previous research has focused on clinical/translational research, which aims to translate scientific discoveries to public use. Further, no previous research has assessed the relationship between altmetrics and modern citation impact factors like the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\u2019s Relative Citation Ratio (RCR). It is also unclear whether publication in journals with higher journal impact factors (JIFs) may drive both public attention and academic impact. We investigated whether early altmetric indicators of splash predict citation ripples, beyond the effect of the JIF. For a portfolio of 2188 publications supported by the NIH\u2019s Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance from 2007\u20132020, we collected 2020 Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS), 2020 JIFs, and 2021 RCRs. All three were significantly correlated with one another. Regression analyses revealed that AAS significantly predicts later RCR, controlling for JIF and publication year. Findings indicate that in clinical/translational science, articles that make a big splash of altmetric attention have ripple effects through increased citation influence, which is not entirely due to publication in higher impact journals. Altmetric attention may be a useful early indicator of eventual influence and potential for translational advancement.",

    "title": "Rosemarie Rizzo Parse: Creator of an Eternal Fire of Nursing",
    "abstract": "Parse\u2019s founding of the preeminent Nursing Science Quarterly journal is one flame from her cocreation of an eternal fire of nursing with the publication of her books The Humanbecoming Paradigm: A Transformational Worldview (Parse, 2014) and The Humanbecoming Paradigm: An Everchanging Horizon (Parse, 2021). Fire is a significant symbol to highlight the immense success in the generation and dissemination of nursing knowledge that Parse fostered through the nursing journal. Fire is one of four essential elements for life: fire, air, water, and earth (Firefighter Garage, n.d.). The fire of nursing knowledge in Nursing Science Quarterly is essential to the advancement of nursing science and its theories and frameworks. The new knowledge in the journal is presented in sections such as major articles, theoretical concerns, research issues, ethical issues, teaching-learning, practice applications, scholarly dialogue, philosophical issues, health and public policy, and global perspectives. Each section is a flame of the fire of nursing. Recently a section for PhD students was initiated to inspire them and illuminate for them the essence of nursing by creating new knowledge, using creativity and symbols of flames of fire. There is nothing like the liveliness of imagination in the creation of knowledge. When one reads the content of these sections, one can see why fire is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge (Fire, n. d.) in nursing, specifically nursing science and nursing theories. The content in the journal is applicable to nurses worldwide. The authors and the content of their writings in the journal give evidence of symbols such as creativity, desire, divinity, hope, inspiration, passion, power, purification, and spiritual enlightenment (Fire, n. d.; Firefighter Garage, n. d.; MerriamWebster, 2020). Purification involves eliminating nonnursing aspects, which still remain in nursing, as the purpose of the journal \u201cis devoted exclusively to the enhancement of nursing knowledge\u201d (clearly noted in each Nursing Science Quarterly issue). The work of Elizabeth Barrett illustrates how Nursing Science Quarterly helps to advance nursing knowledge. Barrett stated that Parse inspired her to create her power as knowing participation in change theory, which was published in Nursing Science Quarterly. Barrett\u2019s power writings spearheaded a multitude of research studies and theoretical thinking that continues in various publications today. These are examples of the resonating rhythm of knowledge development fostered by this scholarly journal. Occasionally symbols of fire are seen in editorials or articles where authors have a burning zeal and passion about controversies in nursing that relate to the birthing of new ideas and concern about the resurrection of traditional ideas about nursing. The content of the journal advocates new ways for the wellbecoming of people and the healthcare system. Parse\u2019s guardian angel must have used pandimensional awareness and nonlocal communication with her, since angel number 35 became manifest for the 35th year recognition of Nursing Science Quarterly. Angel number 35 symbolizes positive life changes such as creativity, enthusiasm, exploration, imagination, motivation, and vision (Angel Number, n.d.). All of these symbols are relevant and inherent in the various international authors\u2019 writings in NSQ over 35 years. Imagine a resonating rhythm creating new nursing knowledge each year for 35 years, all for the advancement of nursing theory, research, and practice. This rhythm kept the fire of nursing burning brightly with multiple flames for all dimensions of nursing. Parse was able to unify nursing and with angel 35 to identify, experience, and express her fiery passion for nursing and its science with publications in the journal, all germane to her intellectual firepower. The eternal fire of nursing continues to burn, seeking knowledge for nursing science. Imagine what Parse has achieved with Nursing Science Quarterly, the fire of nursing, and angel 35, and where there is much left unspoken and unwritten of her advocacy for nursing science, research, and practice and the remarkable quality of the journal. The eternal fire of nursing is brilliant with flames for cutting edge issues yet to be imagined for the further advancement of nursing science.

    "abstract": "Effective learning is learning that is able to change the behavior of students which includes knowledge, reasoning, skills and habits. Mathematics learning in schools has two goals, namely (1) the formation of students' characters who are logical, critical, rational, careful, effective and efficient and (2) the implementation of the results in everyday life and the development of science. According to the author's observations as a mathematics teacher at this junior high school, most of the eighth grade students cannot solve story problems correctly. In addition, the administration of exams, whether in the form of a national competency assessment or school exams using multiple choice questions, can stimulate students to complete with shortcuts. This causes students to find it increasingly difficult to work on story questions that are challenging and require higher thinking. To improve students' skills in solving story problems, it is necessary to emphasize the use of procedural steps as recommended by George Polya, namely understanding the problem, compiling a settlement plan, implementing a settlement plan and checking the results obtained. This research was carried out in two cycles. In the first cycle, it was found that the students' skills in solving the story problems of the Two Variable Linear Equation System were not maximized. The percentage of skills reaches 45% and completeness of learning reaches 40%. In the second cycle after reflection and improvement, the percentage of skills obtained is 75% while learning completeness reaches 76%. Thus, students' skills increased by 30% and learning completeness increased by 36%. From this study, it was concluded that through the use of the Polya step, the skills of class VIII C students of SMP Negeri 02 Rumbia in the 2020/2021 academic year in solving story problems of a two-variable linear equation system could be improved. Finally, the author suggests the VIII grade math teacher at SMP Negeri 02 Rumbia to be able to use Polya's steps in learning related to story problems so that students can solve problems systematically.\nABSTRAKPembelajaran efektif adalah pembelajaran yang mampu mengubah perilaku peserta didik yang meliputi pengetahuan, penalaran, kecakapan dan kebiasaan. Pembelajaran matematika di sekolah mengemban tercapainya dua sasaran yaitu (1) terbentuknya karakter peserta didik yang logis, kritis, rasional, cermat, efektif dan efisien dan (2) implementasi hasil dalam kehidupan sehari- hari dan pengembangan ilmu pengetahuan. Menurut pengamatan penulis sebagai guru matematika di SMP ini, sebagian besar siswa kelas VIII tidak dapat menyelesaikan soal cerita dengan benar. Di samping itu penyelenggaraan ujian baik itu berupa Asessmen kompetensi nasional maupun ujian sekolah yang menggunakan soal pilihan ganda dapat merangsang siswa untuk menyelesaikan dengan jalan pintas. Hal ini menyebabkan siswa semakin sulit mengerjakan soal-soal cerita yang menantang dan menuntut pemikiran lebih tinggi. Untuk meningkatkan keterampilan siswa dalam menyelesaikan soal cerita perlu ditekankan penggunaan langkah prosedural sebagaimana dianjurkan oleh George Polya yaitu memahami masalah, menyusun rencana penyelesaian, melaksanakan rencana penyelesaian dan memeriksa hasil yang diperoleh. Penelitian ini terlaksana dalam dua siklus. Pada siklus I diperoleh hasil bahwa keterampilan siswa dalam menyelesaikan soal cerita Sistem Persamaan Linear Dua Variabel belum maksimal. Persentase keterampilan mencapai 45% dan ketuntasan belajar mencapai 40%. Pada siklus II setelah dilakukan refleksi dan pembenahan, diperoleh hasil persentase keterampilan sebesar 75% sedangkan ketuntasan belajar mencapai 76%. Dengan demikian keterampilan siswa meningkat 30% dan ketuntasan belajar meningkat 36%. Dari penelitian ini diperoleh simpulan bahwa melalui penggunaan langkah Polya, keterampilan siswa kelas VIII C SMP Negeri 02 Rumbia Tahun Pelajaran 2020/2021 dalam menyelesaikan soal cerita sistem persamaan linear dua variabel dapat ditingkatkan. Akhirnya penulis menyarankan kepada guru matematika kelas VIII SMP Negeri 02 Rumbia untuk dapat menggunakan langkah Polya dalam pembelajaran berkaitan dengan soal cerita sehingga siswa dapat menyelesikan soal secara sistematis.",

    "title": "Addictive behaviour of students: Early detection experience and socio-psychological characteristics",
    "abstract": "Introduction. Today, there is an increase in the risks of involving minors in various forms of deviant behaviour, among the varieties of which addictive behavioural models are particularly dangerous. In this regard, proactive preventive measures are becoming particularly relevant, among which one of the key areas is the timely identification of potential addicts, including among students of educational organisations.Aim. The aim of the study was to identify the actual socio-psychological characteristics of the personality of underage students who are prone to addictive behaviour.Methodology and research methods. The comparative-analytical method of working with scientific literature presented in eLIBRARY.RU, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases was used as the main theoretical method. When organising the study, the authors relied on a number of methodological provisions: the structural method, when the research material is interpreted in accordance with the specific characteristics of the object of study; the method of comparisons, which consists in comparing individual results with each other. The main empirical method was the testing method. To obtain the results of the study, the authors employed a unified methodology of socio-psychological testing aimed at the identification of the risk of formation of addictive behaviour in minors. For mathematical and statistical data processing, the Statistics SPSS 19.0 package was applied: the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Dmax criterion (for boys and girls separately and jointly), the Mann-Whitney U test, regression analysis, analysis of averages, confidence and percentile intervals. Also, the factor analysis method was used \u2013 the principal component method, Varimax rotation. The stability of factors was calculated using the Lewandowski\u2019s method. The study was conducted in different regions of Russia in 2019\u20132020. The sample consisted of 6,300 people.Results. Based on the analysis of scientific sources, the authors described the epidemiological picture of various forms of addictive behaviour of minors, the differences between male and female samples (young men demonstrate a greater desire for leadership, protest reactions, rivalry, and girls are more anxious, frustrated, focused on internal experiences), the interrelationships between the scales of the methodology and the poles of the selected factor structure from the point of view of asociality and prosociality of juvenile behaviour (desire for risk, social maladjustment, avoidance of conflict and others).Scientific novelty. The scientific novelty of the results is due to the receipt of relevant data on the specifics of the socio-psychological characteristics of modern adolescents and young men prone to addictive behaviour.Practical significance. The practical significance lies in the fact that the identified socio-psychological characteristics of the behaviour of a person prone to addictive behaviour can become the main planning work on the early detection of a tendency to addictive behaviour, organisation of preventive work with imperfect-year-olds, as well as for the organisation of psychological work with students at risk.",

    "abstract": "Transitions to cleaner, renewable energy are at the heart ofpolicies in many countries. The focus on renewables has, ifanything, become greater recently as uncertainty growsabout the viability and acceptability of alternatives toachieve low-carbon growth, including nuclear power andcarbon capture and storage (REN21 2010). The Fukushimaaccident has forced many governments to rethink theirnuclear energy plans\u2014Japan has just shutdown their lastnuclear power plant, and Germany announced last year itwill be nuclear free by 2022. But transitions away fromfossil fuel-based energy systems have proven slow despitethe potential of renewable energy sources and advancingtechnologies to utilize them.Recent research in \u2018Transitions Studies\u2019 argues thattransitions will not be a technological \ufb01x but will requiresome combination of economic, political, institutional andsocio-cultural changes (Berkhout et al. 2009; Cohen et al.2010; Stephens et al. 2008). Without doubt, these transi-tions must be guided by an ethics that brings togethertechnology and sustainability. In the introductory messageto this special issue, Jean-Louis Armand calls for such anethic of long-range responsibility\u2014one that is properlyembedded in sustainability science as a guide for ourfuture.In response to this complex issue, Sustainability Sciencehas organized a special issue on two related themes\u2014thecosts of mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions andthe diffusion of clean energy technologies. The \ufb01rst fourpapers model abatement costs for world regions andsectors with a focus on medium term GHG emissiontargets (2020 and 2030)\u2014a key step in stabilizing long-term climate change under the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These studies\ufb01nd that transitions toward a low-carbon society are notan extension of the current trends, and far greater GHGreductions\u2014both on national and global scales\u2014arerequired in the mid-term. A further \ufb01ve papers explore thebarriers and opportunities of energy transitions on theground, using transition management theories to explainempirical cases in India, Japan, Malaysia and the UnitedStates.Hanaoka and Kainuma conduct a comparison of GHGmarginal abatement cost (MAC) curves from 0 to200 US $/tCO",

    "title": "The Secret Sauce: Examining Law Schools that Overperform on the Bar Exam",
    "abstract": "Since 2010, law schools have faced declining enrollment and entering classes with lower predictors of success despite recent signs of improvement. At least partly as a result, rates at which law school graduates pass the bar exam have declined and remain at historic lows. Yet, during this time, many schools have improved their graduates\u2019 chances of success on the bar exam, and some schools have dramatically outperformed their predicted bar exam passage rates. This Article examines which schools do so and why. Research for this Article began by accounting for law schools\u2019 incoming class credentials to predict an expected bar exam passage rate for each ABA-accredited law school. This Article then examines each law school\u2019s aggregated performance on bar exams for which its graduates sat based on relative and absolute performance, weighing the difficulty of each state\u2019s bar exam. Through this analysis, this Article identifies law schools with consistently higher and lower first-time bar exam passage rates over a period of six years between 2014 and 2019. In addition to identifying law schools that overperform on the bar exam, this Article is a novel contribution not only to the legal education literature but also to the quantitative methodological literature, given its unique tailoring of the classic value-added modeling design to the realities of the bar exam. In the second phase of research for this Article, the authors surveyed administrators at these overperforming and underperforming law schools, as well as law schools in the middle of the distribution, to qualitatively assess how these law schools approach the bar success of their students. Collectively, this Article provides significant insight into how law schools are responding to recent negative trends in bar passage rates, validates successful approaches to mitigate these negative trends, and * CJ Ryan is an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law and an Affiliated Scholar with the American Bar Foundation.

In 2021, law school enrollments saw increases for the first time since 2010; however, as of late, enrollment rates have remained fairly stable. Id. For example, in 2020, enrollment rates stayed at 2019 levels. See Karen Sloan, Most Law Schools Brought in Larger 1L Classes.

Although passing the bar exam is certainly not the singular reason that a prospective law student seeks to attend law school, success on the bar exam is an important factor\u2014at varying degrees, dependent on the student\u2014in the calculus for why many current students are attending law school.2 After all, without a Juris Doctor School Enrollment for 2020 Remains Stable, AM. BAR ASS\u2019N (Dec. 28, 2020), https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2020/12/law-school-enrollment/ [https://perma.cc/2MW8-FZ36]. Yet, bar passage rates are at or near all-time lows in many jurisdictions. See Debra Cassens Weiss & Stephanie Francis Ward, Afternoon Briefs: Bar Exam Pass Rate Hits New Low in California; Ben & Jerry\u2019s 'Happy Cows\u2019 Suit Tossed, ABA J.

Many law schools have placed blame on the difficulty of the bar exam, especially in states like California.

Other studies and licensing authorities have placed blame on worsening student credentials. See William Vogeler, Study Blames Law Students Not Law Schools for Low Bar Pass Rates, FINDLAW (Apr. 22, 2019, 12:01 PM), https://blogs.findlaw.com/greedy_associates/2019/04/study-blames-law-students--not-law-schools---for-low-bar-pass-rates.html [https://perma.cc/B7C3-6NSA] (citing a study by the ABA noting that law student credentials have declined nationally over the last few years). And many law schools have considered a variety of curricular changes, only occasionally with empirical support. See Louis N. Schulze, The Science of Learning Law: Academic Support Measures at Florida International University College of Law, 88 BAR EXAM\u2019R, Summer 2019, at 2, 9, 11; Mario W. Mainero, We Should Not Rely on Commercial Bar Reviews to Do Our Job: Why Labor-Intensive Comprehensive Bar Examination Preparation Can and Should Be a Part of the Law School Mission, 19 CHAPMAN L. REV. 545, 554\u201355, 596 (2016). 2. Of course, the decision by a student to attend law school is multifactorial. There is a robust literature on student choice in the undergraduate context of the higher education sector. See generally, e.g., Robert K. Toutkoushian, Do Parental Income and Educational Attainment Affect the Initial Choices of New Hampshire\u2019s College-Bound Students?, 20 ECON. EDUC. REV. 245 (2001); Laura Walter Perna, Differences in the Decision to Attend College among African Americans, Hispanics, and Whites, 71 J. HIGHER EDUC. 117 (2000); Stephen L. DesJardins et al., Modeling the College Application Decision Process in a Land-Grant University, 18 ECON. EDUC. REV. 117 (1999); James C. Hearn, Determinants of Postsecondary Education Attendance: Some Implications of Alternative Specifications of Enrollment, 10 EDUC. EVALUATION & POL\u2019Y ANALYSIS 171 (1988). Yet, there is little scholarly attention to student choice in the graduate education context and legal education in particular. Two recent and contemporaneous studies shed light on the factors that prospective students considered in deciding whether to attend law school and the factors that influenced their decisions. In both studies, bar exam success was a factor in most students\u2019 decision to attend law school. However, the extent to which the bar passage rate of a given law school was an important factor in a student\u2019s decision to attend law school varied with the student\u2019s credentials on entry.

In 2011, Addiction Science & Clinical Practice (ASCP) Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Samet (with the late Editor Emeritus Richard Saitz) took the reins of our journal from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to usher it into a new era as an open-access forum for clinically relevant research and perspectives that contribute to improving the quality of care (prevention and treatment) for people with unhealthy alcohol, tobacco, or other drug use and addictive behaviors across a spectrum of settings. Now, as we begin our 11th year, we can look back at our accomplishments over the last decade: we have published 766 articles (44% from outside the US, 26% from Europe); produced 5 thematic series, 1 special issue, and 10 supplements; and forged lasting partnerships with the International Network on Brief Interventions for Alcohol and Drugs (INEBRIA) and the Addictions Health Services Research (AHSR) Conference. ASCP has been cited 7277 times with a yearly average 12% increase that jumped to 28% in the last year. Notably in 2020, we received a firsttime Journal Impact Factor of 3.088, 7th of 20 addiction journals (it has since climbed to 3.544 in 2021). We are proud of these accomplishments and grateful to our team of outstanding associate editors, our editorial board and managing editor, our contributors, and all of you who contribute your time to review articles for us. The work of our ASCP community has never been more relevant. Though addiction is a consistent and ubiquitous threat to public health across cultures and societies globally, roughly over the same period as our journal was gaining momentum, substance use reached an all-time high. The US opioid overdose crisis hit peak levels of deaths and increasingly became characterized by polysubstance use with particularly large increases in methamphetamine use among people who use opioids [1]. Overdose deaths from cocaine and methamphetamine increased 3and 13-fold, respectively [2, 3]. Unhealthy alcohol use increased substantially, particularly in women; alcohol-related deaths doubled between 1999 and 2017 and served as a major contributor to the decline in overall US life expectancy observed between 2015 and 2017 [4]. Though tobacco use has declined overall worldwide, use has increased among men; 45% of adults in South East Asia use tobacco [5], and vaping among youth increased ~ 75% between 2017 and 2018 with greater increases expected annually [6]. Finally, both medical and recreational cannabis use have become increasingly legal and accessible, creating a need for studies about its epidemiology and treatment, particularly its longitudinal health impacts [7]. This time was also marked by new funding mechanisms and multiple innovative and rigorous efforts to implement evidence-based care for substance use in medical settings [8\u201311] and innovative clinical trials [12\u201314] the results of which have informed clinical guidelines [15] and ongoing conversations about best practices [16\u201318]. Despite these innovations, the majority of persons with unhealthy substance use, substance use disorders, and/or other addictive disorders do not receive evidence-based care [19, 20].

    "abstract": "Service outsourcing industry is the \"green engine\" of a country's economic development. It is also a strategic industry for Hubei to transform its economic growth mode, adjust its industrial institutions and realize the leapfrog development of modern service industry. This paper analyzes the opportunity and mechanism of developing service outsourcing industry in Hubei province, and puts forward some countermeasures for Hubei province to take service outsourcing as a breakthrough point, implement differentiation strategy, create the advantages and characteristics of Hubei service industry, and promote the leapfrog development of Hubei economy. From 2020 to the middle of this century, the comprehensive construction socialism modernization country, Hubei economic development is still in an important period of strategic opportunities, advanced manufacturing and modern service industry on the bidirectional pull strategy, development of service outsourcing industry is promising, this can not only be Hubei economic restructuring and transformation of the mode of growth important gripper, can also become a new way to achieve the leap development of modern service industry of Hubei province. Mechanism Analysis of Leapfrog Development of Service Outsourcing Industry in Hubei Province Service Outsourcing Industry Is the Adhesive of Manufacturing Advantage and Service Industry Development in Hubei Province. Hubei manufacturing categories are complete, and it has formed an industrial cluster with automobile, iron, steel, chemical, raw materials, manufacturing, tobacco, textile, teaching materials, agricultural products processing and general equipment manufacturing industry. From the perspective of technological progress, high-end service industry is not only the medium and prerequisite for the development of manufacturing industry, but also the result and product of the development of manufacturing industry. Service Outsourcing Industry Is the Converter of the Emerging Service Industry and Human Resource Advantage into Competitive Advantage in Hubei Province. Service outsourcing is inseparable from service trade. New technologies, new modes and new formats of service industry continuously enter the field of service outsourcing. In 2017, Hubei province's total import and export of services totaled us $12.14 billion, still ranking first in central China. The structure of trade in services has been improved. The province's emerging service trade grew faster than the traditional service trade, and its share continued to rise, reaching 162 million us dollars, accounting for 1.3%, up 0.5 percentage point year-on-year. New areas such as intellectual property use fees, cultural and entertainment services, and repair and maintenance services all increased by more than 30 percent (36 percent, 52 percent, and 164 percent, respectively. Service Outsourcing Industry Is the Propeller for Hubei to Attract Domestic and Foreign Capital Investment. In 2017, the average salary in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, was 6,331 yuan.

    "abstract": ": As a vital resource endowment area and ecological barrier area in China, low-carbon development in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is of great significance. This paper compiled the emission inventory in the Upper Yangtze River Economic Zone in the IPCC regional emission accounting method framework and used the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model to evaluate economic development and carbon emissions. Finally, this paper used the time series method to predict carbon emissions to 2030. We find that carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions increased rapidly from 2004 to 2012. The average annual growth rate reached 9.16%. After 2012, carbon emissions in the region no longer grow steadily but fluctuate or even decline. The secondary industry contributed 79.77%, the tertiary industry contributed 17.78%, and the primary industry only 2.45% from 2000 to 2015. From the industrial sector and energy consumption, thermoelectricity production and supply division and nonmetallic mineral products industry are the sectors with the most CO 2 emissions, accounting for 35.54% and 13.34%, respectively. Raw coal and coke are the main factors causing emissions. Nearly 61.32% of the carbon dioxide produced by raw coal comes from the electricity production sector. However, from 2011 to 2015, the CO 2 emissions of raw coal decreased year by year, down by 23.32%. The impact of economic growth on carbon dioxide emissions supports the EKC hypothesis. The CO 2 emissions in the Upper Yangtze River Economic Zone will decline after 2020, but Chongqing has shown an upward trend. With the above results, provinces and cities can optimize the regional industrial structure based on sectoral carbon emissions. The study area needs to develop clean energy to optimize the coal-led energy consumption structure. Provinces and cities in the district can learn from each other\u2019s advanced emission reduction experience. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

    "title": "Open Chinese New Deal - The Interpretation of the New Development Model and Policy of the 11th Five-Year Plan",
    "abstract": "The new deal of China can be generalized as follows. A theme, sustained development; two motifs, harmonious society and scientific outlook on development; four focal points, the building of a new socialist countryside, the rising of the region, developing a circular economy, as well as the innovation for science and technology; a guarantee, reform. The building of a new socialist countryside marks the beginning of Chinese Roosevelt New Deal. To implement the policy of government intervention at present will avert from economic crisis that is resulted from the process of industrialization. The age of stimulating economic growth by ultra-low cost in the east has come to an end. The key to continuing the dream of world factory in China lies in the central region that can cope with the industrial transfer from the eastern region. In the new round of reform debuting, two kinds of tendencies should be against. One is the tendency of questioning the direction of the reform. The other is sanctifying the reform. Only in this way can it be guaranteed that we will intensify the development of reform in the right direction, so as to provide strong guarantee for the New Deal of China. Compared with the policy of reform and opening-up that changes the Chinese economy from the state of poverty and ignorance into the miracle of China, the Chinese New Deal will give great impetus to turning the economic development from the model of high speed into the pattern of high quality, comprehensive, balanced and sustainable. It is estimated that this Chinese New Deal will yield results around 2020, at the time of which the target of building a new socialistic countryside will be realized by and large, China will enter the late stage of industrialization, and the overall economic strength of China will rank in the first three places in the world",

    "title": "Publications on Post-Covid Mucormycosis: A Bibliometric Study of WHO Database.",
    "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a large number of publications to inform, understand, conduct more research and control the situation. Although the researchers are analyzing the bibliometrics on this condition, no bibliometric studies are available on the publications related to post-covid mucormycosis. This study is aimed at bibliometric assessment of the publications related to post-covid mucormycosis.\nMethods: In the presented study, authors have performed the bibliometric analysis of the World health organization (WHO) database named \u2018Global literature on coronavirus disease.\u2019 WHO is maintaining this database since the pandemic, and it contains thousands of reports. Two simple search terms, \u2018Covid\u2019 and \u2018mucormycosis\u2019 used to search the entire database in \u2018title, abstract, subject\u2019 mode with the search string was tw:(mucormycosis covid). The search was not restricted to any date range.\nResults: Only 51 reports (40 articles and 01 clinical trials) were obtained with the above search terms. The study found that there is considerable growth in such publication in the last 6 months. Interestingly only three such reports were published in the year 2020. Database wise 38 of these 51 reports were available in Medline. Most of such reports were published by Indian authors. Indian Journal of Ophthalmology emerged as the most productive journal contributing the highest number (10) of these reports.\nConclusions: The highly acclaimed publications were the reviews. This study suggests that India is the most productive country for publications related to post-covid mucormycosis. This resembles the fact that the country, faced the excessive emergence of post-covid-19 mucormycosis cases reported the secondhighest number of Covid 19 cases in the substantial worldwide outbreak in the second wave, which is followed by post covid mucormycosis.\nBangladesh Journal of Medical Science Vol.20(5) 2021 p.144-147",

    "title": "Response to \u2018A well\u2010established fact: Rapid mineralization of organic inputs is an important factor for soil carbon sequestration\u2019 by Angers et al.",
    "abstract": "In a recent opinion piece, Angers et al. (2022) comment on our earlier article about carbon sequestration in soils (Berthelin et al., 2022), and opine that in that article we present \u2018some interesting considerations, at least one of which is already well-known to soil scientists working on soil organic carbon (SOC), that is, a large portion (80%\u2013 90%) of fresh carbon inputs to soil is subject to rapid mineralisation\u2019. They argue that the \u2018short-term mineralisation kinetics of organic inputs are well-known and accounted for in soil organic matter models\u2019, and they object to what they portray as our perspective that longterm predictions of soil carbon sequestration based on these models overlook short-term mineralisation. Angers et al. (2022) evidently miss the main point made by Berthelin et al. (2022). Our argument is not that rapid mineralisation of organic inputs is overlooked per se, but that its significance in limiting SOC sequestration appears to be frequently overlooked in considerations of practices to sequester SOC in the context of mitigating climate change. In Berthelin et al. (2022) we take great care to explain that a significant body of literature has been devoted to the rapid mineralisation of fresh inputs and how the resulting information, by way of first-order kinetic parameters, has been incorporated into computer models that have been used extensively to predict the fate of SOC under different climate scenarios and agricultural practices. A key point we make is that only about 10% of the C added in fresh organic additions becomes stabilised in the long term (say 30 years, as illustrated in figure 1 of Berthelin et al., 2022): Long-term stabilisation of C is a necessary requirement for mitigating climate change. Another way of expressing this is to say that to achieve a desired increase in stable SOC, 10 times this quantity must be added initially. This raises a major challenge concerning the sources of such large additional C inputs, as discussed in our paper and also by Janzen et al. (2022). Angers et al. (2022) cite many examples of changes in agronomic practice that lead to increased SOC. These are entirely valid, beneficial and non-controversial. An excellent example they cite is the major change in cropping practice in the semi-arid Canadian Prairies to eliminate summer fallow and move to no-till instead of conventional ploughing. There is no question that where such changes are possible they should be encouraged using whatever policy, financial or advisory mechanisms available. The question in the context of slowing climate change is the scale of C sequestration that is achievable in practice. Angers et al. (2022) also cite an example of SOC increases achieved in China since 1980 (Zhao et al., 2018). Unfortunately, this is a less convincing example of SOC sequestration contributing to climate change mitigation. At least part of the recorded SOC increases over a 30-year period resulted from increased crop yields caused by greatly increased applications of nitrogen fertiliser and the cited study takes no account of additional greenhouse gas emissions associated with this. Offsetting the beneficial impacts for climate of increased SOC sequestration by other greenhouse gas emissions was discussed by Gao et al. (2018) in the context of Chinese agriculture. A reminder that SOC sequestration must not be viewed in isolation. To conclude, we are in full agreement with Angers et al. (2022) that it is vital to increase organic matter in soils to the extent possible to enable them to withstand the effects of climate change and facilitate the range of functions required by humanity (Baveye et al., 2020, 2022; Vogel et al., 2022). Where we disagree is the extent to which increasing SOC can contribute to climate change mitigation through the build-up of stable forms of C for the reasons we have discussed. Further interdisciplinary research is urgently needed to better understand the microscale processes involved in organic matter mineralisation and stabilisation and eventually make sound, scientifically-based recommendations to policymakers. In the context of climate change mitigation, it is worth recalling words by Bossio et al. (2020). They commented that SOC sequestration is not an alternative to emission reductions in other sectors, but an additional opportunity, and one that \u2018should be neither dismissed nor exaggerated\u2019.

    "abstract": "Rockstrom et al. (2009) proposed \u2018Planetary Boundaries\u2019 which is a concept involving Earth system processes that contain environmental boundaries. In the framework, nitrogen (N) cycle, rate of biodiversity loss and climate change have been transgressed by humanity already. In 2015, the United Nations (UN) established the global agenda for sustainable development until 2030 and defined it as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including 17 specified goals with 169 targets. Many goals were related to land use and management changes (LUMC) with carbon (C) and N dynamics among atmospherebiosphere-pedosphere systems with agricultural activities, such as Zero Hunger (Goal 2), Climate Action (Goal 13), Life on Land (Goal 13) and so on (https://www.undp.org/sustainabledevelopment-goals). Soils could be C sinks or sources depending on climate, land use and management changes (CLUMC) in different plant-soil ecosystems. Soil N and its dynamics not only affect plant growth and crop production but also control soil C sequestration. Thus, C and N dynamics affected by CLUMC in terrestrial ecosystems contribute not only to global and local environmental problems, including global warming, destruction of the ozone layer, acid rain, and eutrophication, but also to changes in soil fertility and crop production related to human sustainable development (Cheng 2020). Many of our colleagues around the world are studying the C and N dynamics by CLUMC in different regions and countries with various ecosystems. We need to share our knowledge and learn from each other researches and discuss how to do the next studies for the UN-SDGs. Therefore, we have held the \u2018International Symposium on C and N Dynamics by Land Use and Management Changes in East and Southeast Asian Countries\u2019 on September 10\u201312, 2018 in Tsuruoka campus, Yamagata University, Japan, and published a special section in Soil Science and Plant Nutrition (SSPN) titled as \u2018Soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics by land use and management changes in East and Southeast Asian countries (Soil C and N by LUMC).\u2019 There were 20 papers in the special section, including 4 review papers and 16 original articles (Cheng 2020). Many papers in the special section have been cited many times during the last 2 years. Two years late, we planed the second international symposium for similar topics on September 28\u201330, 2020 in Tsuruoka, Japan again. Since the outbreaks of COVID-19 pandemic around the world from January 2020, we could not invite and receive guests from foreign countries. Therefore, we decided to hold an International Online Symposium (IOS) on Soil C and N Dynamics by Land Use, Management, and Climate Changes. In this virtual symposium, a total 56 of our colleagues in 14 countries around the world participated and presented their newest research results in this IOS (Figure 1). More than 80 young students in many universities have joined the IOS to learn the front knowledge in the world (Figure 2). The IOS also celebrated Professor Kazuyuki INUBUSHI will officially retire from Chiba University in March 2021 since many of his former students around the world joined the IOS together even during the COVID-19 pandemic period. As much of the research presented in the IOS is valuable, original, and has not been published yet, we organized a special section \u2018Soil C and N response to climate, land-use and management changes (Soil C, N and CLUMC)\u2019 in SSPN. In addition, we also collected original related papers from colleagues around the world who did not attend the symposium. Finally, we accepted 20 papers, including 2 review papers and 18 original articles, for publishing in this special section of Soil C, N and CLUMC. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities are causing climate change, including global warming. To slow climate change requires reducing these emissions. The government of many countries declared that they would realize carbon-neutrality (net-zero carbon emissions) by around 2050. Net-zero emissions will be achieved when all GHGs (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), etc.) emissions released by human activities are counterbalanced by removing GHGs from the atmosphere in a process known as carbon removal. Since the forests are a very important sink of atmospheric GHGs, we need to understand the real potentials of forests for mitigating climate change. In this special section, Sase et al. (2022) reviewed the reactive nitrogen (Nr) from the atmosphere by both domestic and transboundary air pollution and its dynamics in center Japan from their long-term investigation. The current atmospheric dissolved inorganic N is still high, at over 10 kg ha year, which implied the C sequestration and CH4 absorption and N2O emission should be affected by the Nr deposition. Xu (2022) reviewed the effect of freeze-thaw disturbance on soil C and N dynamics and GHG fluxes of East Asia forests according to the laboratory and field measurements. His review showed freeze-thaw disturbance mostly increased concentrations and leaching fluxes of",

But several months ago, the supercomputer expert and deputy director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in California did just that. He bet Thomas Lippert\u2014a German colleague\u2014$2000 that supercomputer makers wouldn\u2019t create an exascale computer by the beginning of 2020. If built, this next major milestone in supercomputing will be capable of carrying out 10 fl oating-point operations per second, or an exafl op. That\u2019s 57 times as fast as today\u2019s fastest supercomputer, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s Titan, which runs at 17.6 petafl ops (10 fl ops). Such intense computing power could vastly improve everything from climate models to the engineering of engines to work with advanced biofuels. A quick glance at supercomputing trends would suggest that Simon\u2019s bet is a bad one. The improvement of high-performance computers (HPC) has been on an unvarying upward trajectory. The industry marched from the fi rst terafl op (10 fl ops) machine to the fi rst petafl op machine in just 12 years. Extrapolate this steady rate of progress, and supercomputers should reach exascale computing in 2018. But troubles are brewing. Supercomputer experts agree that scaling up existing technology won\u2019t get supercomputers to the exascale level. Intel, IBM, and other hardware makers say they won\u2019t pursue exascale computers without government backing. The United States, China, Japan, Russia, India, and the European Union are all fl irting with exascale plans. But to date, governments have balked at committing the hundreds of millions to billions of research dollars likely to be needed to create the new technology. Just a year ago, supercomputer experts were confi dent that the industry would cross the exascale threshold between 2018 and 2020 (Science, 27 January 2012, p. 394). Now, that confi dence is slipping. \u201cThere was a fair amount of traction with exascale,\u201d says Jack Dongarra, a supercomputing expert at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who closely tracks international supercomputing trends. \u201cSome of that is gone now. That\u2019s a big disappointment,\u201d Dongarra says. John Hengeveld, the HPC segment marketing director for Intel in Hillsboro, Oregon, is more upbeat: \u201cI don\u2019t think there has been any setback on the path to exascale.\u201d However, he adds, \u201cthere is a question about national will.\u201d For Dongarra, Hengeveld, and many others, the key question is which country will step up to create the fi rst exascale computer. The answer will determine more than who gets bragging rights for leading high-performance computing technology into the future. Because the effort is expected to revolutionize the design of everything from computer logic and memory to the interconnections and software that make them all run, the race could determine which country\u2019s high-tech fi rms are likely to dominate computer technology in the decades ahead. And because scientists Who Will Step Up To Exascale?",

    "abstract": "The Editor-in-Chief and Executive Editors of the Journal of Sports Sciences all identify as male and white. Although the journal\u2019s Associate Editors and the Editorial Advisory Board are more diverse, it is cold comfort that the Journal of Sports Sciences is not alone in having very few senior editors who identify as female or people of colour (Mart\u00ednez-Rosales et al., 2021). The lack of diversity in gender and ethnicity on editorial boards has been an issue for a long time across many fields of study (Alkhawtani et al., 2021; Metz & Harzing, 2009, 2012; Van Miegroet et al., 2019) and the historic underrepresentation of women in public office (Uberoi et al., 2021) and company boardrooms (Davies, 2011) has not evaded academia. Yet, it is argued that the relationship between women and leadership is not simply one of under-representation, but of male dominance (patriarchy), with sport one of the key domains for the confirmation of masculinity (Messner, 2007; Ryan & Dickson, 2018). Although we do not have data on editorial board ethnicity for our field of science, it is likely that people of colour are equally, if not more, under-represented at this level (Ford et al., 2017). Although the under-representation of women is clearly a multifactorial problem (Hardcastle et al., 2019), we can start to understand how the problem may develop in sport and exercise science by examining the gender diversity of students entering academic programmes across countries and continents. In the UK, for example, where the Journal of Sports Sciences is published, 48.7% of the adult population report to be female (Office for National Statistics, 2020), whereas the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency reports that 32% of those studying undergraduate sport and exercise science in the 2019/ 20 academic year were female (13,840 \u2640 vs 28,885 \u2642) (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-b). The gender imbalance in sport and exercise science contrasts with that observed across all higher education courses in the UK, where 57% of students are female (1.4 M \u2640 vs 1.1 M \u2642) (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-b). Moreover, the imbalance doesn\u2019t appear to have shifted much over time, with females accounting for 29% of undergraduate sport and exercise science students in the 2014/15 academic year (13,875 \u2640 vs 33,325 \u2642) (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-c). The number of females doing a postgraduate research or taught degree in sport and exercise science in 2019/20 was 1755, representing 33% of all postgraduate sport and exercise science students (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-b) (1755 \u2640 vs 3560 \u2642). So, the figures do not differ markedly relative to the proportion studying at undergraduate level. As far as academic staff working in sport and exercise science departments, in the UK, 37% are female (1125 \u2640vs 1915 \u2642) (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-d). In contrast, the number of female academics across all fields of higher education in the UK in 2019/20 was 104,305, representing 47% of all faculty, which is very close to the proportion of female adults in the UK (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-e). However, the percentage of female academics at \u201csenior\u201d level drops to 39%, and then further to 28% at professorial level. Collectively, these data suggest two things: (1) the gender imbalance in sport and exercise science is evident in undergraduate sport and exercise science programmes; and (2) this imbalance creates a smaller cohort of potential female sport and exercise science academics, particularly at senior level from whom editorial positions are normally filled. Unfortunately, data on ethnicity are not as accessible as those for gender. It is therefore difficult to quantify if sport and exercise science journals and/or student cohorts lack ethnic diversity. Data across all fields of higher education show that about 25% of students are people of colour (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-a), yet fewer than 1% of professors are Black (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-e), the latter constituting a lower proportion of Black academic staff (3.5%) compared to white professors as a proportion of white academic staff (11.9%) (Joice & Tetlow, 2020). It is therefore highly likely that people of colour are under-represented on editorial boards (Ford et al., 2017). Moreover, the interaction of gender and ethnicity (Ryan & Dickson, 2018) creates an even greater barrier for women of colour. Although women and people of colour are underrepresented at the higher levels of academia and on editorial boards, why does this matter? There are two main reasons. First, although contested, it is a moral issue (K\u00f6llen et al., 2018). Second, and as outlined by Fine et al. (2020) in relation to gender diversity, ensuring equal access to leadership positions \u201cmakes an important contribution to reducing the broader political, sociocultural, and material disadvantages women face, in part by giving women greater influence in high-level decision-making\u201d. Although an argument for gender and/or ethnic diversity on sociocultural grounds",

    "title": "How many check dams do we need to build on the Loess Plateau?",
    "abstract": "F more than 400 years, check dams have been constructed on the Loess Plateau of China. Over the past several hundred years, people have increasingly realized the advantages of check dams for capturing sediments, improving gully slope stabilities, and increasing croplands. In Environmental Science and Technology, Wang et al. summarized the advantages of check dams for environmental services and food security. The report demonstrated that about 110,000 check dams have been built on the Loess Plateau over the past 50 years and approximately 21 billion m of sediments have been captured by these dams. Moreover, the filled check dams can be reclaimed as croplands, and by 2002, approximately 320,000 hectares of dam croplands had been created. The significant role of check dams in soil conservation and cropland expansion inspires the passions of policy makers. As early as 2003, the Ministry of Water Resources of P.R. China (CMWR) initiated a program for check dams in the Loess Plateau, and 163,000 check dams are planned and an investment of 83.06 billion RMB of funding is required for the period 2003\u22122020. Policy makers consider that the Loess Plateau has the capacity to allow the construction of as many as 334,000 check dams and will therefore require an even greater amount of investment. The Loess Plateau is currently undergoing a great leap forward in check dam construction. The CMWR has set a target of 47,000 check dams, built at an investment of more than 20 billion RMB, from 2010 to 2015. Increasing numbers of environmental scientists are concerned about the negative effects of such large-scale engineering on the balance of the water cycle and sediment load in the Yellow River. The CMWR projects that, by 2020, check dam construction will lead to a 4.3\u22125.5 billion m decrease in water yield to the Yellow River. However, the amount of this decrease is highly uncertain. The actual amount may exceed the projected amount due to trends in climate warming and extensive human activities. The sediment load and streamflow in the Yellow River have dramatically decreased in recent years. Huang et al. reported that the sediment load delivered from the Yellow River to the sea decreased sharply to 0.15 billion tons per year between 2000 and 2005, representing only 14% of the widely cited estimate of 1.08 billion tons per year. The data released by the Yellow River Sediment Bulletin show that the sediment load gauged by the Huayuankou hydrologic station decreased substantially to 0.107 billion tons per year between 2000 and 2010. This value represents only 10% of the sediment load of 1.054 billion tons per year occurring between 1950 and 2000. Moreover, the annual streamflow in the Yellow River averaged 40.05 billion m between 1950 and 2000, whereas it decreased to 22.65 billion m during the past decade. Many scientists conclude that human intervention is the primary factor that caused the decrease in the sediment load and streamflow in the Yellow River. However, we still have not determined a suitable sediment load and streamflow that would keep the Yellow River healthy, and therefore determine the appropriate number of check dams that should be built on the Loess Plateau. The Loess Plateau covers an area of 648,700 km, including 200,000 km of highplain plateau, 140,000 km of hilly plateau, 107,200 km of rocky mountains, 63,600 km of Fen River\u2212 Wei River fault depression valley, 79,2000 km of deserts, and 58,700 km of Hetao alluvial plains (Figure 1). The different geographical regions play different roles in soil and water conservation and ecosystem services. The hilly plateau regions suffer the most severe soil erosion in the Loess Plateau and should therefore be considered critical areas for check dam engineering. The rocky mountain regions are appropriate for planting and should therefore be considered critical areas for afforestation and water conservation. We suggest that the planning of check dam engineering should comply with the landforms and geographical function zones. Currently, many significant problems occur in the planning and engineering of check dams. First, there is a lack of critical discussion on the appropriate density and distribution of check dams. The contiguous area of Shanxi-Shaanxi-Inner Mongolia is the central erosion area of the hilly plateau and is therefore the most critical target area for check dam construction. However, a large number of check dams are still planned for construction in the highplain plateau and rocky mountains. Second, effective soil and water conservation measures and climate change significantly decreased soil erosion in the Loess Plateau and",

    "abstract": "Background: Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is associated with older age. Antiglaucoma medications (AGM) are the cornerstones in the management of POAG. However, the relationship between AGM utilization, patients\u2019 medication adherence (MA) and the therapeutic outcome remains largely unexplored among older persons. \nObjective: This study aimed to evaluate AGM utilization patterns, patients\u2019 MA and intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction among older persons. \nMethods: This study was a 5-year retrospective review of medical records of consecutively selected older persons diagnosed of POAG at a University teaching hospital, in southwest Nigeria. Older persons were included if (1) aged 65 years and above, (2) had attended the outpatient ophthalmic clinics of the hospital between January 2010 and December 2015 (3) had at least 1-year clinic attendance during the period. The relationship between AGM utilization, patients\u2019 self-reported MA and physicians\u2019 comments on IOP was evaluated. A bivariate analysis was carried out to determine associations between variables and MA. Factors associated with IOP reduction were determined using a logistic regression. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. \nResults: The carbonic anhydrase inhibitors comprised (66/191; 34.6%) of the total 191 AGM prescriptions. Majority of the participants (36/60; 60.0%) had reduced IOP with AGM alone, of which (13/36;36.1%) were on triple AGM. The participants\u2019 MA (p=0.01) and number of AGM (p=0.04) were significantly associated with IOP reduction among the participants in a logistic regression. \nConclusion: The number of AGM prescribed and the patients\u2019 medication adherence can influence IOP reduction among older persons with POAG. \nBangladesh Journal of Medical Science Vol.19(1) 2020 p.141-147",

    "abstract": "Background: Cerebral palsy describes a group of disorders of development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation, that are attributed to non- progressive disturbances that occurred in developing fetal or infant brain. Spider therapy is an intensive treatment approach which was originally developed in Poland. It involves suspending the child in the Centre of universal exercise unit by using a number of elastic bungee cords of different elasticity. These cords are attached to specific points on special belt around the child\u2019s waist, forming a unique spider web around the child which provides them essential support.\nPurpose: The purpose is to study the scientific evidences regarding the effect of the spider therapy on motor functions and balance in cerebral palsy\nMethodology: A search for relevant articles was carried out using key words- cerebral palsy, spider therapy, motor functions and balance and search engines-Google Scholar, PubMed, PEDro, Science Direct, Research Gate and CINAHL.

    "abstract": "Soil functions are fundamental for solving the societal challenges of food security, climate action, biodiversity protection and environmental integrity. Yet, soils have suffered from the \u201cCinderella syndrome\u201d for decades when it comes to the public perception of the relevance of natural resources for human well-being. Blum (1993) eventually \u201cpassed the golden shoe\u201d with the introduction of the soil functions concept, which triggered public understanding of the potential of soils to store carbon, to host biodiversity, to transform matter into plant-available nutrients, to retain and purify water, and to contribute to plant growth. The soil function concept was further elaborated as a link between ecological processes and human well-being to support the science\u2013policy interface (Bouma, 2010; Helming et al., 2018) the science\u2013practice interface (Schulte et al., 2014) and a systemic approach to science-based decision support (Vogel et al., 2018). Still, at the European level, a soil policy framework failed to be implemented following multi-annual negotiations in the first decade of the 21st Century. In policy regulations and strategies, such as climate strategies, biodiversity strategies, bio-economy strategies, and the agri-environmental and greening measures of the European Union Common Agricultural Policy, soils are treated implicitly as co-objectives or supporting measures rather than explicitly (Gl\u00e6sner, Helming, & de Vries, 2014). Most of these policies and strategies are not legally binding or treat soil protection as an optional rather than mandatory instrument. A further boost to soil protection, and in particular to the carbon storage function of soils, emerged in the frame of the Paris Agreement on climate action in 2015, when the French Ministry launched the so-called 4 per mille initiative (Minist\u00e8re de l'Agriculture, de l'Agro-alimentaire et de la For\u00eat, Hiver, 2015/2016), proposing that with an annual increase of 4 \u2030 of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks the annual increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere would be significantly reduced. However, the feasibility of the 4 per mille initiative under current conditions for agricultural management has been heavily challenged by some leading soil researchers (Baveye, Berthelin, Tessier, & Lemaire, 2018) and the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC) in November 2017 had not taken the topic up (Rumpel, Lehmann, & Chabbi, 2018). Also as part of its climate protection efforts, the European Commission adopted the European New Green Deal in 2019, which aims to achieve carbon neutrality by the year 2050 through an ecological transformation of the economy. Therein, the Farm to Fork strategy lays the foundation for a sustainable food system, which considers soil functions not only as carbon reservoirs but also as key partners in the transition to agro-ecological economies with a strong reduction in pesticide use. With these strategies' efforts to return to a circular economy and to reduce the use of finite resources, the intrinsic potential of soils to deliver ecosystem services and to convert (solar) energy into plant biomass is ultimately regaining the fundamental importance it always had in pre-industrial times. Synergies, but also trade-offs and spill-over effects, in environmental and socioeconomic terms, might be associated with this endeavour (Fuchs, Brown, & Rounsevell, 2020), and have to be carefully revealed in scientific assessments. This special issue of the EJSS presents contributions from participants of the Wageningen Soil Conference in August 2019 (https://wageningensoilconference.eu/2019/), which was held for the fourth time since its establishment in 2011, with a focus on \u201cunderstanding soil functions \u2013 from ped to planet\u201d. The conference received over 250 participants and discussed a range of topics based around four key themes: 1. Soil functions for society 2. Innovative methods for measuring soil functions 3. Modelling and mapping of soil functions across scales 4. Can we understand synergies and trade-offs between soil functions?",

    "title": "The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and its role on the world stage",
    "abstract": "It is a pleasure to write this contribution for National Science Review and to share information about the different pathways being followed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) toward a worldwide sustainable society. IUPAC was founded in 1919 with a strong impetus from chemical industries that recognized the importance of using a common language, particularly for chemical compounds, so that they would be able to communicate with each other. After IUPAC\u2019s beginnings in Europe, it expanded and has become a truly worldwide organization, representing the global interests of the chemistry community and scientific communities associated with chemistry. These include academic institutions, industry and society at large. IUPAC\u2019s vision of being a global indispensable source of chemistry is embodied in our mission to provide objective scientific expertise and develop the essential tools for applying and communicating chemical knowledge tobenefithumankindand theworld. This is achieved through our providing a common language for chemistry, advocating the free exchange of scientific information, and fostering sustainable development. Scientific excellence and objectivity, diversity and inclusiveness, are IUPAC core values that are particularly important in order to give objective advice and recommendations as a response to the many challenges that are faced by chemists, the scientific community and society. Our centenary year, 2019, was also the International Year of the Periodic Table of the Chemical Elements (IYPT), of which IUPAC was the leading partner. The many events held all over the world demonstrated the enthusiasm for chemistry by all, of different ages and from all parts of society. It enabled us to show the fascination for the chemical elements and emphasized how many positive things theydo for us in contributing to our lives. A Periodic Table Challenge was held, taken by over 65 000 people in 136 countries. Following its huge success, a second edition was launched in June 2020 and has been equally successful; there are now versions in Chinese, Arabic, Spanish and Russian. The Chinese version has already been taken by several thousand people. Other centenary year initiatives that continued in 2020 and are continuing in 2021 are the Global Women\u2019s Breakfast (GWB), and the Top Ten Emerging Technologies series of articles. Highlighting these new technologies is a way for IUPAC to help show how chemists are contributing to adapting the chemical industry to new needs, with new materials and using processes that are less energy intensive. The Periodic Table of Younger Chemists, another IYPT initiative, in collaboration with the International Younger Chemists\u2019 Network, has led directly to a new project: ChemVoices, the international voice of the younger chemists, which began a series of webinars in September 2020. Core IUPAC activities continue, of course, and we continue to develop chemical nomenclature, with recommendations and technical reports, all open access, appearing in our journal Pure and Applied Chemistry. The \u2018Color Books\u2019, provide standards and standardized nomenclature in different areas of chemistry. It will be particularly important to develop Cheminformatics standards, of which the international chemical identifier (InChI) is an excellent example. Pure and Applied Chemistry also publishes themed scientific issues, many of them linked to important contributions made in IUPAC-endorsed conferences. Our publication Chemistry International highlights important news items and the results of our projects, and Chemistry Teacher International is our publication for educators. We value our collaborations with international organizations such as UNESCO, International Science Council (ISC), International Bureau of Weights andMeasures (BIPM), the Organization for theProhibition ofChemicalWeapons (OPCW) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). For example, IUPAP collaborates with us to determine when a new element has been synthesized and identified. IUPAC was awarded the Hague award of the OPCW in 2019 for its work in collaboration with OPCW to further the peaceful uses of chemistry. IUPAC\u2019s 2300 volunteers are from all over the world, representing scientists in different areas of chemistry and multidisciplinary areas with the best skills and knowledge. We have 54 national adhering organizations (NAOs), and over 800 Affiliate Members, Company Associates and Associated Organizations. Together we identify current and emerging scientific issues and problems and reach consensus on approaching and solving them. The Chinese Chemical Society joined IUPAC as an NAO in 1979. Since then, chemical sciences and technology in China have undergone fast development and now China is one of the most important countries in the chemistry field worldwide. China has played an important role in IUPAC. Prof. Chunli Bai has served in the IUPAC bureau and executive committee. Prof. Qifeng Zhou has served as IUPAC President in 2018\u2013 2019; under his leadership, IUPAC coordinated the IYPT activities with great success.",

    "title": "Highly Sensitive Simultaneous Measurement of Steroid Hormone in Human Serum by Liquid Chromatography-electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry",
    "abstract": "A high sensitive simultaneous determination method of nine steroid hormones including Estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OH-P4), androstenedione (AN), progesterone (P4), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and cortisol by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was established in a positive mode using recently developed picolinyl derivatization. Steroid hormones were derived with picolinic acid and 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic anhydride, then purified by solid-phase extraction with InterSep SI cartridge. The LC-ESI-MS/MS method enhanced the specificity and sensitivity for E1, E2, T, DHT, DHEA, and cortisol. The method validation indicated that the limits of quantification for E1, E2, T, DHT, 17OH-P4, AN, P4, DHEA, and cortisol were 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 20, and 100 pg/tube, respectively with acceptable accuracy and precision within \u00b1 15%. The present method was applied to the measurement of nine steroid hormones in children\u2019s serums with high reliability and reproducibility. \nKeywords: LC-ESI-MS/MS, steroid hormone, picolinyl derivatization, human serum, solid-phase extraction. \nReferences \n[1] A.

    "title": "A Study on Student's Perception about Teacher Effectiveness between B. PEd and M. PEd Students of Davangere University",
    "abstract": "In order to execute all programmes successfully in the educational sector, human resources are important. Teachers are the most needed resources for the smooth execution and achievement of the educational objectives and policies in the classroom practically. Teacher effectiveness is a critical area of inquiry that has emerged through the years among educational researchers. In this study, teacher effectiveness is linked to student engagement. The higher the teacher\u2018s effectiveness, the greater the tendency for the learner to be actively engaged, which will eventually lead to students academic gains. Teacher effectiveness predominantly influences student academic growth. Sometimes, when a student does not perform well on a test, it is generally assumed that only the student is responsible for his or her poor performance. In fact, one of the strongest reasons might be the poor teacher's performance. In that case, the student, being a primary consumer of the teacher\u2018s services, can be better informed about the teacher's effectiveness. Student surveys can be effective and trustworthy sources for teacher evaluation and the best sources of teacher quality. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to know the student\u2019s perception about teacher effectiveness between B. P. Ed and M. P. Ed students of Davangere University. Procedure: The selected sample consists of eighty (N=80) physical education students, forty students from each of the B. P. Ed and M. P. Ed programs. The subjects studied at Davangere University at the Shivagangotri campus during the academic year 2020-21. The Teacher Effectiveness score of the subjects was obtained by the Teacher Effectiveness Scale in Higher Education Questionnaire. Statistical Technique: The data collected to achieve the purpose of the study was tested with a paired sample \u0333 t\u2019 test statistical technique was applied. The level of significance was set at 0.05. Data was analysed by using the statistical package for social science (SPSS) 28th version. Results: There was a significant difference in students\u2018 perceptions of the teacher\u2018s relational competence between B. P. Ed and M. P. Ed students of Davangere University.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT IMPACT: Learning Health System (LHS) Science that trains postdoctoral scholars from diverse professional backgrounds in methodological and professional skills to implement rigorous research in health care systems and populations, and to disseminate the findings of such research to improve healthcare delivery OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The WFUHS CTSA developed an innovative TL1 in Learning Health System (LHS) Science that trains postdoctoral scholars from diverse professional backgrounds in methodological and professional skills to implement rigorous research in health care systems and populations, and to disseminate the findings of such research to improve healthcare delivery METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Training is centered around formal LHS science coursework and mentored research projects that address a pressing health system issue. Projects are closely guided by a primary mentor and a multidisciplinary mentoring team. Program mission and competencies were carefully evaluated in a competency-course matrix to design new courses for the LHS Certificate and MS program in Translational and Health System Science (THSS). Course domains include biomedical informatics; improvement and implementation science; system science and organizational change management; stakeholder engagement, leadership, and research management; ethics of health systems research; and health systems research methods. Scholars set up Individual Development Plans (IDP) and self-assess 7 domains of LHS core competencies. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The first professionally diverse group of scholars (MD, PhD, DrPH, PharmD) began the program in Summer 2020; onboarding was conducted virtually. Scholars currently conduct most of their research and training in a virtual, synchronous format. Each developed a detailed IDP and LHS research project, which was reviewed by their LHS mentoring teams (includes a primary mentor, co-mentor, TL1 core faculty mentor, peer mentor, and health system mentor). Coursework, leading to a 1-year certificate or 2-year MS degree, was selected based on individual background and career goals and was begun in August 2020. In addition to the courses noted above, Scholars are embedded in a healthcare improvement team. We use the process of a LHS and hold weekly TL1 leadership meetings to swiftly address challenges and implement improvements DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: We envision that TL1 Scholars will build independent LHS research programs or lead health system innovation. Program evaluation includes assessments of Scholar fluency in LHS competencies and attainment of key milestones during and after training. Annual TL1 faculty retreats will address program fidelity and implementation of program refinements",

    "title": "Editorial",
    "abstract": "Welcome to the third issue of Volume 130 of Applied Earth Science and my third editorial of 2021. This editorial focuses on diversity, and the importance of diverse viewpoints in both research and mineral exploration. As the snippet of text above indicates, people tend to surround themselves with similar people, or with people who look, and more importantly for this editorial think, alike. This applies to friend groups, to research groups, and to work groups and beyond in industry. Although at first this may create groupings that mesh together well and work effectively, this approach to teambuilding in either academia or industry is fundamentally flawed because it has a tendency to create echo chambers; situations where certain beliefs (or, for example, geological models or types of scientific thinking) are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system that is insulated from rebuttal. This situation is ripe for the stifling of innovation and other failures, as has been demonstrated in a number of cases. One of the most famous of these is the recruitment policies of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from the beginnings of the organisation in 1947 to the late 1990s and early 2000s. These policies undoubtedly led to the recruitment of brilliant people, but these people almost always looked (and thought) in a similar fashion, leading to a very homogenous organisation dominated by white, middle-class, Anglo Saxon, Protestant males. This homogeneity has been blamed for the failures in intelligence that eventually led attacks like September 11th in New York and at the Pentagon (e.g. Jones and Silberzahn 2020). Intelligence agencies in the USA acknowledged these failures, now recognise that diversity is \u2018a mission-critical imperative\u2019 (Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2021) and have moved to increase diversity with a series of targeted initiatives to improve the capabilities of organisations like the CIA. Closer to home, the importance of diversity of all types in research and science has been demonstrated numerous times (e.g. Nielsen et al. 2017, 2018; Swartz et al. 2019) and diverse teams within all branches of science are often more successful and more innovative than more homogenous teams. This may seem intuitive but is often ignored, leading to research teams and groups in industry that again act as echo chambers where all of the members of the group have similar knowledge bases and approaches, potentially stifling innovation and the introduction of new ideas. This is especially crucial in mineral exploration and the minerals industry, where breakthroughs often lead to competitive advantages and new discoveries. All of this indicates that diversity and inclusion should be core values for all organisations concerned with innovation and research and moves to improve in these areas may well pay off in numerous ways. Equally important is that all members of teams are recognised for their efforts, innovation, and breakthroughs. This is especially important for demographically under-represented students and researchers who are often more innovative than their more well-represented peers but who also have contributions that are often discounted and who are less likely to obtain higher academic positions (e.g. Hofstra et al. 2020). This lack of equitable recognition is certainly one of the numerous factors involved in leaky pipelines in academia and industry, where talented people from historically under-represented groups miss out on opportunities or leave the sector entirely as a result of a lack of equity within the system. The lack of diversity and the associated lack of acknowledgment of the importance and value of diversity is certainly prevalent in the geosciences (e.g. Bernard and Cooperdock 2018; Dutt 2020) and the minerals industry. Indeed, a number of cases and countries have situations where historically underrepresented groups of all types encounter situations that may well be far worse (and more common) than those that are well-documented in academia (e.g. Botha 2016; Monteiro et al. 2019). All of this acts to drive people from historically under-represented groups away from our science, meaning that the already exclusive and non-diverse geosciences could become even less diverse, to our own detriment. As I mentioned in my Issue Three editorial from last year (Jowitt 2020), I am certainly not suggesting that this editorial (or even my editorial on this topic from last year) covers all of the diversity, equity, and inclusion issues the geoscience community and minerals industry (and beyond) face. However, it is important to realise the value and innovation that having",

    "abstract": "Anyone with a passing understanding of Canadian politics is aware of the stubborn presence of party discipline in the parliamentary system. It is not a phenomenon that has been left to the stuffy corners of the ivory tower. Political actors and the media have complained about party discipline for decades. Reforms have been proposed; party leaders have promised new ways forward. As a central trait of Canadian Parliament, party discipline has driven away voters\u2014it has even inspired the development of new political parties. What role can Canadian political science play in understanding party discipline 75 years after these familiar sentiments appeared in the predecessor to this journal: \u201cHow could this control [party discipline] be destroyed, and the individual member be made an independent critic of government and of legislation, and a responsible servant of the people\u201d (Morton, 1946: 136)? It turns out Canadian political science has much to offer. With the publication of J. F. Godbout's Lost on Division: Party Unity in the Canadian Parliament and Alex Marland's Whipped: Party Discipline in Canada, 2020 has been a monumental year for the study of Canadian Parliament and political parties.",

    "title": "Did a Chinese team 'obscure' early coronavirus sequences?",
    "abstract": "SCIENCE sciencemag.org I n a world starved for data to clarify the origin of COVID-19, a study claiming to have unearthed early sequences of SARSCoV-2 that were deliberately hidden was bound to ignite a sizzling debate. Last week a preprint by evolutionary biologist Jesse Bloom of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center asserted that Chinese researchers sampled viruses from some of the fi rst COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, posted the viral sequences to a National Institutes of Health (NIH) database, and then later had the genetic information removed to \u201cobscure their existence.\u201d The uproar over the preprint led Senator Josh Hawley (R\u2013MO) to demand answers from NIH on why the agency agreed to \u201cpurge\u201d the data and to call for an investigation into the matter. Even for some scientists, Bloom\u2019s work reinforced suspicions that the Chinese government has tried to hide how the pandemic started. \u201cThis is a creative and rigorous approach to investigating the provenance of SARS-CoV-2,\u201d says Ian Lipkin, a microbiologist at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. \u201cThere may have been active suppression of epidemiological and sequence data needed to track its origin.\u201d But critics of Bloom\u2019s bioRxiv preprint call his detective work much ado about nothing, because the Chinese scientists later published the viral information in a different form, and the recovered sequences may add little to the origin hunt. \u201cThe idea that the group was trying to hide something is farcical,\u201d says evolutionary biologist Andrew Rambaut at the University of Edinburgh. Bloom says he has no bias toward a particular origin hypothesis for SARS-CoV-2, and he agrees that the 13 partial sequences he recovered don\u2019t resolve whether the virus originally jumped to humans from an unknown animal or somehow leaked from a Wuhan virology center. \u201cI don\u2019t think this bolsters either the lab origin or zoonosis hypothesis.\u201d Chinese health officials on 31 December 2019 tied the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan to an outbreak of an \u201cunexplained pneumonia,\u201d but within a month it had become clear that many of the earliest COVID-19 cases had no link to the market. Bloom, who studies viral evolution, set out to investigate early cases after a controversial report on the pandemic\u2019s origin issued in March by a joint commission of Chinese and foreign researchers overseen by the World Health Organization. The report deemed it \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a lab; Bloom helped organize a muchdiscussed letter, cosigned by 17 other scientists, criticizing that conclusion and calling for further investigation. Bloom wanted to do his own analyses of the viruses detected in the earliest cases, which led him to a list of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted before 31 March 2020 to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), an NIH database. But when he checked the SRA for one of the listed projects, he couldn\u2019t find its sequences. Googling some of the project\u2019s information, he found a study, led by Ming Wang from Wuhan University\u2019s Renmin Hospital, that had been posted as a preprint on 6 March 2020 on medRxiv and published in June of that year in Small, a journal little known to virologists. That paper lists some of the earliest COVID-19 patients in Wuhan and the specific mutations in their viruses, but doesn\u2019t give the full sequence data. Further internet sleuthing led Bloom to discover that the SRA backs up its information in Google\u2019s Cloud platform, and a search there turned up files containing some of the Wang team\u2019s earlier data submissions. The Small paper mentions no corrections to the viral sequences that might explain why they were removed from the SRA, which led Bloom to conclude that \u201cthe trusting structures of science have been abused to obscure sequences relevant to the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan.\u201d (In the wake of criticisms of the initial preprint, Bloom toned down this sentence and other accusatory language.) Bloom acknowledges SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be derived from the data in the Small paper, but he says most virologists expect to be able to download whole viral genomes from a database like the SRA. Several authors of the Small paper did not reply to requests for comment, but NIH last week noted in a statement that it removed the SRA sequences at the request of the submitting investigator, who the agency says holds the rights to the data. Bloom added NIH\u2019s email exchange to his revised preprint. \u201cI have submitted an updated version of this SRA data to another website,\u201d reads a 15 June email sent to NIH from a Wuhan University researcher whose name was redacted. Yet Bloom says he cannot find the sequences in any other virology database. Bloom asserts that because the deleted sequences lack three mutations seen in COVID-19 cases linked to the seafood market, the patient viruses Wang\u2019s team analyzed more likely represent a progenitor SARSCoV-2. But Rambaut says the differences Bloom highlighted are too few to distinguish the \u201croots\u201d of the SARS-CoV-2 family tree. Leaving aside the meaning of the sequences Bloom found, the demonstration that researchers can potentially find \u201cnew\u201d SARS-CoV-2 data in the cloud is an exciting advance and may prompt similar sleuthing, says genomicist Sudhir Kumar of Temple University, who has also analyzed early SARS-CoV-2 sequences. \u201cMany people feel that there is a lot more Chinese data out there, and they don\u2019t have access to it.\u201d j Did a Chinese team \u2018obscure\u2019 early coronavirus sequences?

    "title": "Costs of Fallacy Mind to the Global Economics",
    "abstract": "Every day we make decisions that some are small, some are more important thus affect people\u2019s lives. The average adult human brain weighs around 3 lbs. and every day the average person has around 50,000-70,000 thoughts that between 70% to 80% of those are negative so around 40,000 to 50,000. Negative thoughts in a day that need to be managing and filtering not a small task for any person. We should doubt our thoughts all the time. Our mind (thoughts) tricks us into that called fallacies (around 200 different fallacies listed). A fallacy can be defined as an incorrect argument in logic and rhetoric that undermines an argument\u2019s logical validity. Biases are defined as the tendencies to think in certain ways that can lead to systematic deviations from a standard of rationality. Global economy losses trillions of dollars every year because of human-related (DUI) traffic accidents, obesity, crime, alcohol, drug addiction, and many forms of bad decisions by irrational individuals. Millions of people get themselves killed because they are not taken care of their lives properly. Hundred billions of dollars are consuming by the health sector also huge amounts go to prevent crimes by justice departments and military spendings but these scarce funds could be used to end poverty, increase GDP and well-being of billions of people all around the world. J. M. Keynes argued about \u201canimal spirits\u201d to describe the instincts and emotions that influence and guide human behavior. Keynes understood \u201cin such an uncertain world, many decisions can only be taken as a result of animal spirits\u201d. Conventional economic analysis encircles itself to rational, quantifiable facts. But in reality, economic decision-makers are frequently intuitive, emotional, and irrational. Bounded rationality is a concept proposed by H. Simon challenges the notion of human rationality. D. Kahneman & A. Tversky argued about how our minds play tricks on us. J. R. Shiller and G. Akerlof wrote the role played in our economy by animal spirits such as speculative fluctuations in asset prices, changes in investment levels reflect beliefs about changing prices and they believe people live by stories. R. H. Thaler and C. R. Sunstein show that we are all open to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions. The war in Vietnam cost the United States $843.63 billion (2019 dollars) in 1968 and 58,000 dead soldiers. Now, U.S. goods and services trade with Vietnam totaled an estimated $81.3 billion in 2019. U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Vietnam was $2.6 billion in 2019. Iraq War spending (2019 dollars): $1.01 trillion, and U.S. military deaths: 4,410. US taxpayers have paid an average of $8,000 each. In Afghanistan, U.S. war spending (2019 dollars): $910.47 billion and 2,285 U.S. deaths. Around 100,000 Afghan civilians have been injured or killed. President Biden will withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan over the coming month of September 2021. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimated military expenditures in 2018 as $1822 billion globally. North Korea developed nuclear and ballistic missiles through 2020 on the other hand 60% of North Koreans live in absolute poverty making it one of the poorest countries on Earth, new research from Vienna University of Economics and Business make public. Obese people use healthcare services more frequently than most and need more specialty care visits. Providing medical services to deal with this problem can be a drain on healthcare budgets. Almost one in four people in OECD countries are obese. The U.S. spent $190 billion on obesity-related health care expenses in 2005. The United States spends $300 billion annually on police communities and incarcerates 2.2 million people. The societal costs of incarceration are estimated at up to three times the direct costs, bringing the total burden of the US criminal justice system to $1.2 trillion. The estimated cost of drug abuse in the United States\u2014illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco\u2014is more than $740 billion a year according to National Institute on Drug Abuse. The global gambling market is expected to grow from $465.76 billion in 2020 to $516.03 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8%. Around 1.6 billion people gamble throughout the year. 2 billion of the entire world population gambled at some point in their lives. Approximately 1.35 million people die in road crashes each year. An additional 20-50 million suffer non-fatal injuries, often resulting in long-term disabilities. According to a Stanford Law School report, around 90% of all motor vehicle car accidents are caused fully or in part by human error. Human error has an effect in 70% to 80% of industrial accidents, as well as in a substantial percentage of errors in healthcare. Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, found that medical errors kill from 44000 to 98000 Americans annually. WHO reports that globally, hospital-acquired infections cause suffering to 10% of hospitalized patients. Medical errors hurt nearly 40% of patients in primary and outpatient care. Diagnostic and medication errors harm millions thus cost billions of dollars every year. Since the 1880s, the earth\u2019s average temperature has increased around 1.2 degrees Celsius. Air pollution \ufeff\ufeff\ufeff is the fourth main risk factor of premature deaths globally and in 2013 cost the global economy $225 billion as lost labor.\ufeff\ufeff World Health Organization says air pollution kills 7 million people each year.\ufeff OECD estimates that, by 2060, air pollution is expected to cost the global economy severely $2.6 trillion every year and air pollution will cause around 9 million premature deaths every year by 2060. Oceans soaked up most of the added CO2 from the atmosphere thus they\u2019ve become 30% more acidic since Industrial Revolution causing a mass extinction of sea life around half of the world\u2019s coral reefs have died in the last 30 years. Between 2008-2018, events related to climate or weather have displaced 22.5 million people annually and by 2050, climate change could be the cause of as many as 1 billion people emigrating. Deforestation has led to the loss of 46% of the world's tree. In developing countries, small farmers cut down trees and then burn them also Illegal logging is responsible for between 15% and 30% of all wood traded globally in the middle of $30 billion and $100 billion annually. Deforestation costs between $2 trillion and $4.5 trillion annually due to the loss of biodiversity. From politics to health and finances, humans can occasionally make decisions that irrational and we are eventually beginning to realize that irrationality is the actual invisible hand that guides human decision-making. All decision-makers around the world should take rational decisions as much as they can to decrease the harm to themselves and to society. The global costs of irrational decisions then could spend on poverty reduction, health, education, and UBI in order to reach a just society that Plato has written in his seminal book \"Republic\" nearly 2,400 years ago.",

Along with more than 5,000 publishing members of all shapes and sizes, the company embraces technology providers, funders, libraries, and researchers as well. Unlike many other traditional annual meetings, the one for Crossref this year, named Crossref LIVE16, was a 2-day event filled with both quite casual and plenary sessions with the underlying theme of 'smart alone, brilliant together.' On the first day of November, Crossref LIVE16 had a grand opening with a mashup day, where scholars were welcomed and had time to chat with Crossref staff in an open-house atmosphere. Attendees were able to see the latest projects by the Crossref team members, ask questions, and share ideas. The second day of the event mainly revolved around different sessions, with a series of presentations by invited speakers as well as the Crossref team, including its executive director, Mr. Ed Pentz, one of my close colleagues. All of the talks were highly informative. For example, Mr. Dario Taraborelli, the Director of Research at the Wikimedia Foundation, conveyed a powerful message about the importance of text and content mining rights and open metadata for scientific literature, which can enable biocurators and open knowledge contributors to share information with the public. Mr. Ian Clavert, a senior data scientist at Digital Science, also discussed his thoughts on the current trends and patterns of published metadata using the Crossref metadata application programming interfaces. Crossref has been pursuing its mission in 5 ways: rallying the community; tagging metadata; running a shared infrastructure; playing with new technology; and creating tools and services to improve research communication. We are currently expecting the release of Crossref Event Data, a community-led service that will provide open data on events that occur around scholarly research objects on the web. Event Data will track shares, mentions, and likes from social media, sharing platforms, and blogs, as well as links to datasets. Incorporating all Crossref projects starting with relevant working groups, Crossref can build a framework that will make scholarly content more discoverable in order to accomplish the goals of a new initiative, known as Metadata 2020.

    "abstract": "Background Studies indicate high rates of substance use among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). Further, the social networks of YEH, although multi-dimensional in composition, are largely comprised of other YEH, substance users, and individuals who do not provide the youth with tangible or emotional support. For YEH who have the opportunity to enter a housing program, helping them to reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections during this critical transition period may increase their stability and reduce their risk of re-entering homelessness. The goal of this study is to pilot test a brief motivational network intervention (MNI), delivered by case managers, to help former YEH who have recently transitioned to a housing program reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections. Methods/design Up to 60 residents of housing programs in the Los Angeles area will be randomized to receive four sessions of usual case manager support or four sessions of case manager support\u2009+\u2009MNI. Each MNI session consists of three parts: (1) identifying two goals that are most important for the resident over the next year (e.g., get or keep a job, finish or stay in school, reduce substance use); (2) a network interview with the resident to capture network data pertaining to their interactions in the past 2 weeks; and (3) a discussion between the case manager and the resident of the resulting network visualizations, conducted in a Motivational Interviewing (MI) style, and what role the resident\u2019s network may play in reaching their most important goals over the next year. Discussion This study addresses a critical gap by pilot testing a computer-assisted MNI, delivered using MI techniques, that can help case managers work with recent YEH to reduce substance use and increase permanent supportive connections during the critical transitional period from homelessness to housing.

    "abstract": "Objective: Female sex workers (FSWs) under 20 years of age range from 1,000 to 575,000 in different cities and countries across the globe. There is only a handful of information on the reproductive health (RH) issues of these younger FSWs in the perspective of service utilization and healthcare system. We reviewed existing literature with a view to describe the reproductive health problems, service utilization, and service availability as well as information sources among the FSWs ages <20 years. \nMaterials and methods: A web-based search using Google, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/ PubMed/ PubMed Central, HINARI and JSTOR was performed in English Language. The prevalence of a health issue and percentage of service utilization had been shown using ranges of minimum and maximum value which were calculated by different studies. \nResults: Findings identified the following RH problems: unintended pregnancies (52% - 95%), induced abortion (51% - 53%), repeated or multiple abortions (13% - 43%), childbirth experiences, sexually transmitted infections (74%-84%), HIV (1% - 60.6%), violence (beaten, robbed, not paid, forced or coerced sex, rape) and mental disorders (depression, suicidal thoughts). The consistent use of condom (26%-55%) was not satisfactory. Overall 64% of under 20 years FSWs reported little or no access to healthcare in the previous year and access to RH information sources was also poor. \nConclusion: This review has potentially meant to bring forward the RH issues of younger FSWs to the policy makers and programme planners to implement targeted reproductive health interventions for the FSWs ages <20 years. \nBangladesh Journal of Medical Science Vol.19(1) 2020 p.17-31",

Indeed, the American Society for Cell Biology (2010) notes that \u201cbiology learning encompasses diverse fields, including math, chemistry, physics, engineering, and computer science, as well as the interdisciplinary intersections of biology with these fields.\u201d Because of this, interdisciplinary biology courses are increasingly critical for preparing undergraduates for further education and careers in the life sciences. The problem is that many institutions do not reflect this in their undergraduate course offerings. In this letter, we show that the growth of two biological disciplines, namely biochemistry and biophysics, can be described in terms of their representation in the research literature. On this basis, we make predictions about the future trends of research in these disciplines and the implications of these trends for undergraduate education. \n \nThe most widely taught interdisciplinary biological science is probably biochemistry. Many undergraduate biology and chemistry departments recognize its importance and offer it as a core course in their curricula. Biophysics is another interdisciplinary biological science. Although it is not as popular as biochemistry, the growing importance of the subject should be recognized by teaching institutions and reflected in their course offerings. Unfortunately, it seems that the number of institutions that have noticed the demand for it is limited. For example, out of 34 undergraduate institutions in the University of Georgia System (2010) , only 5 offer an undergraduate biophysics course or related courses, such as physical biochemistry. In contrast, 8 of the top 10 universities listed in U.S. News and World Report (2010) teach biophysics or physical biochemistry. \n \nHere, we offer a brief analysis of the primary life sciences literature to support our argument for widespread teaching of biophysics at the undergraduate level. Specifically, we used the number of papers indexed by PubMed (National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2010 ) as a measure of subject importance. We searched PubMed with search terms \u201cbiochemistry OR biochemical\u201d for biochemistry and \u201cbiophysics OR biophysical\u201d for biophysics with a limit of the search to title/abstract for each year from 1950 to 2009. We then normalized the number of papers for each subject to the total number of papers in each year. We recognize that there are limitations to this approach. For example, the DNA structure paper by Watson and Crick (1953 ) is not counted as either a biophysics or a biochemistry paper because it does not contain the search terms in its title or abstract. Yet we believe that this metric reasonably represents the activity of the subjects relative to one another. \n \nFigure \u200bFigure11 shows the normalized number of papers of biochemistry and biophysics, from which we draw three conclusions. First, biochemistry has been continuously growing, with a large increase between 1974 and 1975. This growth may explain why biochemistry is now widely taught. Second, the normalized number of biochemistry publications approaches an asymptotic value suggesting saturation (Figure \u200b(Figure1A),1A), although we cannot rule out the potential for major transitions in biochemistry research to prompt new growth in the field in the future. Third, although the discipline of biophysics is younger than that of biochemistry, it has been growing exponentially (Figure \u200b(Figure1B).1B). This feature can be more clearly seen in Figure \u200bFigure1C,1C, where the number of biophysics papers was normalized to that of the biochemistry papers. Figure \u200bFigure1C1C indicates that the relative importance of biophysics was \u223c12% in year 2009, but if the trend of the last 25 years is maintained for the next 10 years, it will be \u223c20% in year 2020. Current biology seems to be facing the same \u201ccultural transition\u201d that chemistry faced \u223c100 years ago when it started including physics-based approaches in education and research. This incorporation of physics in chemistry resulted in physical chemistry, one of the core areas in chemistry today (Servos, 1996 ). \n \n \n \nFigure 1. \n \nProportion of biochemistry (A) and biophysics (B) papers in PubMed and their ratio ( = biophysics/biochemistry) (C). Extrapolation of the fitting equation is shown as a dashed line (C). Nonlinear curve fitting was performed using SigmaPlot (version 11; ... \n \n \n \nThis analysis reveals the major upswing in biochemistry publications that occurred between 1974 and 1975. We offer a hypothesis to explain this phenomenon: the introduction of a great textbook. We propose that Biochemistry by Lehninger (1970) , which has been widely recognized since its initial publication (Sable, 1971 ), is the original modern biochemistry textbook. Perhaps groundbreaking instructional resources such as this can trigger a quantum leap in research in the discipline. Unlike biochemistry, biophysics suffers from the lack of consensus on the standard topics and skills that should comprise an undergraduate course. This is an issue that biologists and biophysicists need to solve together. \n \nIn conclusion, if training future biologists is one of the goals of undergraduate biology education, then our analysis indicates that we need to make biophysics a standard component of the curriculum, similar to biochemistry.",

Other prestigious institutions, from Romania and abroad, such as the Society of Powder Technology of Japan, Silesian University of Technology of Gliwice, Poland, \u201cAlecu Russo\u201d University of Balti, Republic of Moldova, Technical Sciences Academy of Romania, \u201cLucian Blaga\u201d University of Sibiu, \u201cDunarea de Jos\u201d University of Galati, \u201cStefan cel Mare\u201d University of Suceava and The General Association of the Engineers in Romania (AGIR) were also co-organizers. The ModTech Professional Association currently has more than 400 members from Romania and abroad and 12 branches in Greece, Spain, Malaysia, India, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Iraq, Poland, Turkey, Serbia, and Republic of Moldova. The ModTech2020 International Conference was virtual this year because of Covid-19: meeting restrictions (for enclosed spaces the maximum number of people who could meet was a maximum of 20 people according to the Romanian legislation adopted in emergency situations); travel restrictions (many participants from different countries had travel restrictions imposed by Romanian legislation); imposing isolation measures (after entering Romania) with all the inconveniences that arise from them, but also after returning to the country of origin, most of the time and uncertainties about the state of the pandemic have led to a reluctance by participants to leave their own country. There is a danger of blocking access to a country, of canceling the flight of some companies, etc. Continuity in the annual development of the ModTech International Conference, the wish expressed by many participants, following the consultation carried out approximately 3 months before the conference. The organizing committee respected their desire to hold the conference online, the desire justified by the following reasons: \u2212 the need to publish (disseminate) the research results within some research projects, an important stage of the annual reporting; \u2212 the annual evaluation of the teachers also follows the activity of participation in conferences, the publication in the ISI Proceedings are well rated; \u2212 career promotion also depends on the participation in international conferences (especially ISI indexed) in a given period of time; the existence of a period of interruption of participation in such conferences could diminishes the level of appreciation of the activity from this point of view; \u2212 at the start of the consultation action of the participants, were already a large number of abstracts received and accepted.

    "abstract": "![Figure][1] \n\nHuman capital and economic development.\nKolkata on World Population Day, 11 July 2011. India is projected to surpass China as the most populous country in the world by 2020.\n\n\n\nSocial scientists can be a contentious lot. Since Thomas Malthus issued his dire warning in 1798\u2014and probably before then\u2014scholars have been arguing over how many people the planet can support. There are \u201cdoomsters\u201d who continue to predict the worst, and there are \u201cboomsters\u201d who argue that population growth, while worrisome in many ways, can be an engine of economic growth.\n\nIn the 1960s, when there were half as many people as there are today, the doomsters had their day as fears of a \u201cpopulation bomb\u201d gripped the world. And today's rapid growth rate (7 billion people will occupy the planet this year, and that number is projected to reach 9.3 billion by 2050 and keep climbing) continues to spark alarm. But so far, the neo-Malthusian worries of global mass starvation and global calamitous environmental degradation and ensuing conflict have not materialized. The startling rate of population growth of the 1960s has actually slowed as families have chosen to have fewer children, freely in some countries and under pressure in others. Since 1950, the global fertility rate has dropped by half.\n\nBut at regional and local scales, the news is not good. In some parts of the world, most notably across sub-Saharan Africa, fertility and desired family size remain high, and conflict and famine are all too common. Almost all of the population growth between now and 2050 will be concentrated in the world's poorest countries, which lack the resources to support their burgeoning citizenry. In contrast, in many developed countries and even in some still-developing ones, populations are projected to shrink, and worries center on how to support the higher costs of the aging population on the backs of fewer people of working age.\n\nFind videos, dynamic graphics, a podcast, and more at [ www.scim.ag/pop2011 ][2]\n\nToday these demographic patterns spark concerns, not of a single explosion, but of \u201ccluster bombs\u201d in rapidly growing countries such as Nigeria and Pakistan, which are hobbled by poor governance and limited schooling capacity and already have huge numbers of poorly educated young adults without job prospects.\n\nDebate continues over how best to address these and other problems and over whether rapid population growth is best dealt with by expanding family planning programs or implementing policies that will improve livelihoods and increase the education of girls and young women\u2014or both. Still, many experts remain optimistic that with the right mix of policies, countries can harness the opportunities for economic growth and development offered by a young and educated workforce, congregating in dense, networked urban environments.\n\nThe following special section, which contains News stories by Science 's staff and research assessments by leading experts, enhanced online with videos and dynamic graphics, explores these issues, many of which continue to split demographers.\n\n [1]: pending:yes\n [2]: http://www.scim.ag/pop2011",

    "title": "Vietnamese Herbal Opioid Addiction Treatment Medication Heantos-4",
    "abstract": "Heantos-4 is a non-toxic, non-addictive herbal detoxification medicine for opioid addiction. It was initially invented in Vietnam in the 1980s and tested and developed further in Vietnam in the early 1990s. Since 1995 it has been studied in international cooperation, standardized first into earlier versions and finally to the current version Heantos-4. The various versions have been utilized at Vietnamese inpatient rehabilitation clinics since 1991. During detoxification, it has a predominantly sedative effect. It likely acts as a dopaminergic stabilizer, counteracting both hyperdopaminergic and hypodopaminergic states. Up to 2008, an estimated 9000 patients had been treated. An uncontrolled phase III clinical trial carried out in Vietnam in 2008 indicated an approximately 90% success rate during an initial seven-day inpatient detoxification treatment. This formally unpublished trial is briefly reviewed in this article. In 2012, Heantos-4 was licensed for over-the-counter outpatient use in Vietnam. The Heantos-4 formulation consists of extracts of twelve plants commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). In addition, animal-based gelatin is utilized as a binding agent. The product has been said to conform to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards. The patent of the product belongs to the National Institute of Chemistry of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST). An initial hindrance to clinical trials and international adoption was a lack of necessary polypharmacokinetic methods for determining the constituent molecules and the active agents of the complex mixture. In 2020 a key active agent l-tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP) was identified. Due to synergistic effects between components Heantos-4 likely provides better tolerability and a greater therapeutic efficacy in comparison to l-THP alone. The article also briefly describes the approximately 40-year history of the development of Heantos, partly based on unpublished internal documents of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In the 2000s, a severe opioid epidemic emerged in the United States. More than ever an effective method for resolving opioid addiction is needed. As of yet only uncontrolled clinical trials of Heantos have been carried out. There is thus an urgent need for randomized controlled clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Background: Pre-existing indices predicting the prognosis of COPD do not contain radiologic information and are impractical because they involve complex history-taking or exercise tests. We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning-based survival predictor for COPD utilizing chest radiographs (DLSPCXR) and integrate it with other clinical factors (DLSPinteg). \n \nMethods: Patient with COPD who underwent post-bronchodilator spirometry and chest radiograph (CXR) in 2011-2015 were retrospectively collected and split into training (n=3,475), tuning (n=435), and internal validation (n=315) datasets. A deep-learning algorithm predicting survival from CXR was trained (DLSPCXR), and was integrated with clinical factors, including age, body mass index, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (DLSPinteg). For external validation, three cohorts were collected from different institutions (n=337-416). The discrimination performance of DLSP was evaluated using time-dependent area-under-the receiver-operating characteristic curves (TD-AUROCs) for 5-year survival. Using one external validation cohort, DLSP integ was compared with four COPD-specific clinical indices: BODE, ADO, CAT, and SGRQ. Goodness-of-fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. \n \nFindings: DLSP CXR showed TD-AUROC of 0.670-0.761 for 5-year survival, significantly higher than that of FEV1 in two of three external validation cohorts. DLSPCXR demonstrated good calibration (p>0.05) and worked as an independent survival predictor from FEV1 (p<0.01) in all three cohorts. Integrated with age, BMI, and FEV1, DLSPinteg exhibited TD-AUROC of 0.724-0.825, higher than FEV1 in all cohorts (p<0.05). DLSPinteg also showed a comparable-to-higher TD-AUROC than BODE (0.866 vs. 0.801; p=0.34), ADO (0.860 vs. 0.889; p=0.51), CAT (0.930 vs. 0.549; p<0.001), and SGRQ (0.858 vs. 0.702; p=0.09). \n \nInterpretation: DLSPCXR utilizing CXR worked as a significant survival predictor for COPD, surpassing and independent from FEV1. When integrated with age, BMI, and FEV1, DLSPinteg comparable survival prediction performance to other complex COPD-specific clinical indices. \n \nFunding: National Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2018R1A5A1060031). \n \nDeclaration of Interest: None to declare. \n \nEthical Approval: This study was approved by our institutional review boards (IRB numbers, H-2002-129-1104 [SNUH], BOHUN 2020-07-025-001 [VHSMC] and 2021-0144 [AMC])",

    "title": "A Novel Sutureless Integrated Stented (SIS) Graft Prosthesis for Type A Aortic Dissection: A Pilot Study for a Prospective, Singer Arm, Multi-Center Clinical Trial",
    "abstract": "Background: Various kinds of surgical strategies and prostheses have been advocated to improve short-term and long-term outcomes in type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Large-extent repair of pathological aorta with satisfactory outcomes is hard to achieve. The aim of this study was to investigate effectiveness and safety of a novel Sutureless Integrated Stented (SIS) graft prosthesis on TAAD patients undergoing total arch replacement (TAR) combined with frozen elephant trunk (FET) surgeries. \n \nMethods: All patients admitted to Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria after signing written informed consent. Urgent or scheduled surgery was arranged for eligible patients. Before operation, candidate size of the SIS graft prosthesis was chosen comprehensively according to aortic diameter on different levels measured on aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA). During operation, final appropriate-sized SIS graft prosthesis was implanted under direct vision. The primary endpoint was operative mortality. Secondary endpoints included postoperative rate of stroke, spinal cord injury, unexpected aortic reoperation and so on. All variables related to this study were collected prospectively and classified into preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative and follow-up data. Discharged patients were contacted by telephone 1 month after surgery and were asked to return to hospital 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after surgery. Inquiry, physical examination, aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) examinations and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were performed on the occasion of the return visit. Effectiveness and safety analyses were done in these patients. \n \nFindings: Between Aug 1 and Sep 3, 2020, 10 TAAD patients were enrolled in this study. The SIS graft prostheses were successfully implanted in all patients. The median (IQR) age was 56.50 (43.75, 66.75) years (range from 31 to 75), and 7 patients were male (70.0%). All patients were performed with ascending aorta replacement + TAR + FET. Concomitant procedure included Bentall procedure, David procedure, adventitial inversion technique and ascending aorta-femoral artery bypass. The median (IQR) operation time, CPB time and cross clamp time were 270.50 (218.50, 312.50), 110.00 (88.00, 125.75), 69.50 (51.25, 82.75) min, respectively. Of note, the median (IQR) CA time was 9.00 (8.00, 9.00) min (range from 4 to 12). The median (IQR) lowest nasopharynx temperature was 26.75 (25.98, 27.67) \u00b0C. The median (IQR) platelets transfusion was 1.00 (1.00, 1.00) U. The median (IQR) platelets transfusion was 0.00 (0.00, 0.00) U. The median (IQR) platelets transfusion was 0.00 (0.00, 0.00) mL. No patients died after surgery and no severe postoperative complications occurred. Follow-up was 100% completed. Survival rate at 1-year follow-up was 100%. No patients have ever experienced any major organ complication. Freedom from prosthesis related adverse events and aortic reintervention was both 100%. \n \nInterpretation: The SIS graft prosthesis could be implanted in a novel sutureless way, which simplified surgery procedure, reduced CA time and avoided DHCA. The preliminary clinical outcomes and follow-up outcomes were satisfactory and with 0 death, 0 severe complication and 0 reintervention until 1 year postoperatively, which demonstrated effectiveness and safety of this prosthesis. Large-sample size trial has been conducted to further identify our findings. \n \nTrial Registration: This study was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2000032264. \n \nFunding: Beijing Science and Technology Program (Z191100007619042), Capital Health Development and Scientific Research Foundation (2018-2-4035), CAMS Initiative for Innovative Medicine (2016-I2M-1-016), Special Subject Development Foundation of Fuwai Hospital (2015-FWTS01). \n \nDeclaration of Interest: We declare no competing interests. \n \nEthical Approval: This study was approved by Ethic Committee of Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.",

    "title": "LINK 2021 3rd International Conference on Practice-led research in Art and Design: Forward",
    "abstract": "The LINK conference emerged from reflections and concerns that we always had about our own actions as educators, researchers, and practitioners in the field of Art and Design. Over the years, we have noticed that such concerns have not disappeared. On the contrary: they have multiplied, diversified, and become more complex. The more we dialogued with people worldwide, especially from the socalled \u201cGlobal South\u201d, the more we realised that these same issues were also dear to our colleagues, albeit with their own colours and contours. This is the LINK that unites us. The first step was taken as a small in-person event for guests, held in 2019 at the AUT\u2019s South Campus in Manukau. At that time, there was no intention of organising an annual conference. The magnitude of the issues raised seemed to have a particular inhibiting effect on the incompleteness of the conference itself, considering the potential for the rich and fruitful exchange of ideas. Despite, or perhaps precisely because of the difficulties and adversities, this new scenario compelled us to move forward. The second edition of LINK, carried out in a hybrid way in 2020, expanded the quantity, diversity and quality of the works presented. Emerging themes, new epistemologies, and the multiple relationships between theory and practice (if such a distinction can be made) have consolidated as a sort of amalgam of LINK\u2019s main issues. It covers, in a transversal and interdisciplinary way, arguably the entire field of Arts and Design. These discussions expanded beyond the event, and a special issue with 13 articles was published in the DAT Journal in 2021. At this moment, our doubts and uncertainties gave way to the commitment to promote a better event in each new edition. Furthermore, this commitment is only possible thanks to a team that is both dedicated and passionate about this purpose that unites us. Later that year, the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread across the world. In a short time, uncertainty gave way to millions of people\u2019s anguish, suffering, and pain. At the same time, many ideas, beliefs, and values are starting to be reconsidered, bringing new challenges for a new era. Science, the construction of knowledge, and the University itself have a paradigmatic role in this moment of transformation and the search for the construction of a better world. Research changes the world. LINK\u2019s community is constated by researchers to leverage parameters to activate different ways in which practice can create knowledge. They are based on cultural, geographic, and ideological positions shaped by the communitarian and the glocal. Thus, in offering these practice-oriented research considerations, we propose that we can learn \u201cfrom\u201d rather than \u201cabout\u201d. This feeling emanates from recognising that the peculiar stories that generate social and artistic practices form dialogic encounters with voices on the periphery of authority and loop an iterative process to generate their own theoretical foundations.",

    "title": "Eye care in the developing world: how soon is now?",
    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), four out of five people who will lose their sight will do so unnecessarily. A survey of the global causes of blindness and visual impairment (for which cataract, trachoma, and uncorrected refractive error represent the biggest culprits) reveals that as much as two thirds of global visual impairment is potentially avoidable. Despite the availability of highly cost-effective interventions, the number of blind people in the world is set to double over the next 20 years (WHO). In response to these very sobering statistics, the WHO, in collaboration with the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, has launched a joint initiative to intensify and accelerate present efforts in the prevention of blindness. This proposal, named \u201cVISION 2020: The Right to Sight,\u201d outlines a framework for eliminating avoidable blindness by the year 2020. With just over a decade until its target date, assessing the current situation reveals that many countries (particularly in sub-Saharan Africa) are not on pace to meet this ambitious target. In developing countries, blindness is often inextricably linked with poverty. Worldwide, 90% of people living with blindness also live with minimal health facilities at their disposal (WHO) and often, there are no social programs to rehabilitate the blind. Thus, living with visual impairment results in a profound economic burden because of lost productivity; not only to individuals, but to their families and community. In one study, the cost of global visual impairment has been estimated at $42 billion and is projected to rise to the order of $110 billion by 2020. However, if the goals of programs such as VISION 2020 are attained, costs could be substantially reduced. With restored sight, individuals regain their independence and are in a better position to take care of themselves and their families. Thus, in addition to the obvious reduction in individual suffering, there are enormous economic and social returns from investing in avoidable blindness and promoting sustainable eye care. To advance this initiative, the WHO partners with numerous local governments, eye care professionals, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other not-for-profit agencies. These partnerships facilitate the planning, delivery, and implementation of sustainable national eye care programs worldwide. One such group is Unite for Sight (UFS); a non-profit organization founded in 2003 by then undergraduate student, Jennifer Staple. Since its inception, the program has recruited over 4000 volunteers working in concert with over 90 university chapters and 25 countries including Ghana, India, and Thailand. Internationally, visiting volunteers (including ophthalmologists, optometrists, ophthalmic nurses, residents, and undergraduate students) work with local medical professionals and partner eye clinics to provide eye care in communities without previous access. Last year alone, over 300 000 medically underserved people were provided with free eye care and 10,062 patients received sponsored sight-restoring surgeries. Ghana, a sub-Saharan country located on the western coast of Africa, represents a model paradigm to our discussion. In the whole country, there are 41 ophthalmologists (26 of which are in the capital of Accra), 42 optometrists, and 250 ophthalmic nurses to serve the eye care needs of its population of over 20 million. Since the arrival of UFS in Ghana, numerous positive strides have been accomplished. Partnering with local eye care professionals, UFS volunteers have screened over hundreds of patients per week in rural and underserved communities. Armed with \u201ctumbling E\u201d eye charts, a basic diagnostic kit, various medications, trial lenses, glasses of ranging powers, and a hand-held tomometer, cases are diagnosed and treated on site, corrective spectacles are distributed and patients are educated about the nature of their visual impairments. Those requiring surgical intervention or advanced treatment (e.g., for cataracts, pterygium, complex refractions, and glaucoma) are transported to local eye facilities such as the Crystal Eye Clinic (under the direction of Dr. James Clarke). The cost of transportation, as well as their surgery and medication, are all covered by UFS. Growing on this experience, UFS has expanded its programs throughout the country of Ghana to include underserved communities in the capital of Accra, outlying villages and other regions throughout the nation. In Tamale, the political and administrative capital of northern Ghana, the situation is even more challenging. The northern region of Ghana represents a third of the land area in Ghana, and has a population of over 2 million; 90% of whom are peasant farmers. To serve its people, this region has just one ophthalmologist (S.W.), 12 ophthalmic nurses, and local communitybased volunteers trained in primary eye care. Main activities include community eye screening including local schools, surgery at the base clinic as well as surgical outreach and trachoma control in the surrounding 18 northern districts. The Eye Clinic of the Tamale Teaching Hospital is the only eye clinic equipped to carry out major eye surgeries in the region. Poverty is highly prevalent and widespread, and many citizens cannot afford the cost of basic health services. Despite efforts to reduce the cost of cataract surgery to as low as $35/eye (by comparison, typical costs for cataract surgery in the United States are on the order of $3000/eye), with almost 45% of the population earning less than $1/day, paying for cataract surgery is simply not a possibility. Thus, the arrival of international NGOs such as UFS often represent the only hope for receiving eye care treatment, perhaps in their entire lifetime. Thanks to partnering efforts, to date over 22,879 individuals have been screened, 6400 glasses have been dispensed and over 1406 cataract surgeries performed. Over 5800 school children have been screened 1040-5488/08/8507-0608/0 VOL. 85, NO. 7, PP. E608\u2013E607 OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE Copyright \u00a9 2008 American Academy of Optometry",

    "title": "Comparison of Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) Versus Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Sympathectomy (VATS) for Primary Hyperhidrosis: A Multicenter Cohort Study",
    "abstract": "Background: Hyperhidrosis may affect approximately a hundred million global people; lead to they may be socially stigmatized. We hypothesized that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy (VATS) would be equivalent in the treatment for primary hyperhidrosis (PH). \n \nMethods: In this multicenter cohort study, we recruited patients aged \u226514 years with diagnosed PH from 14 centers in China. The treatment options of RFA or VATS were recruited in patient with informed consent. Clinical effectiveness of treatment was assessed in patients the day of hospital discharge and on the time of study endpoint. Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) and quality of life (QOL) were assessed in patients the day before operative and on the time of study endpoint. The primary endpoint was the rate of complete remission for hyperhidrosis. Propensity scoring and multivariable models respectively were used to assess the clinical effectiveness and the symptom recurrence risk of treatment options. \n \nFindings: Between March 4, 2015, and Sept 31, 2020, 807 patients were enrolled in our study. 351 of these patients underwent RFA, and 456 were VATS. After propensity score matching, the rate of complete remission was lower in RFA than in VATS (287/351[80.3%] versus 319/351 [90.1%], standardized mean differences, -30.4%). We did find the rate of symptom recurrence risk was higher in RFA than in VATS (HR 2.315, 95%CI 1.511-3.546, P <0.0001). HDSS and QOL were significantly improved in postoperative than in preoperative for two groups, however, it was more significant improvement in VATS than in RFA (p<0.0001). \n \nInterpretation: This study suggested that performing RFA or VATS was significant success procedure for patients with PH. However, the RFA had a lower success rate than VATS for complete remission of hyperhidrosis in postoperative 1-year, but it is more possibly accepted due to lower symptomatic burden and costs in patients. \n \nFunding Statement: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81671957, 81873951 and 82072208), Key projects of Guangdong Natural Science Foundation (No. 2018B030311038). \n \nDeclaration of Interests: The writing committee declares that they have no conflicts of interest. \n \nEthics Approval Statement: The study was approved by institution ethics committees at principal investigator centers. All patient\u2019s follow-up provided written informed consent before inclusion. The study was done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice principles.",

    "title": "A Quasi Experimental Study to Assess the Effectiveness of Psycho Education Delivered by Different Health Professionals on Knowledge among Family Members of Patients with Lithium Therapy at Sneka Mind Care Centre, Thirunelveli, Tamil Nadu",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Bipdar disorder is a psychiatric disorder that causes extreme shifts in mood energy and functioning. It is characterized by episodes of mania and depression that can last from days to months and usually begins in late adolescence, but can begin in early childhood or as late as a person\u2019s 40s and 50s. All of us experience changes in our mood day by day. Some days we might feel irritable and frustrated, other days we are happy and excited. However, individuals with bipolar disorder experience sever mood savings that impair their daily life and negatively affect their relationship (Cehassemi R.2005). Lithium has the narrow therapeutic index and many factors can upset the balance lithium concentrations that are well tole rated and produce side effects or toxicity. This is imperative that the person taking lithium can be educated about signs and symptoms of toxicity, factors that affect lithium levels how and when to obtain laboratory testing and the importance of regular communication with the prescribing physician. Proposed Topic of Research: A Quasi experimental study to assess the effectiveness of psycho education delivered by different health professionals on knowledge among family members of patients with lithium therapy at sneak mind care centre, Thirunelveli. Objectives: 1) To assess the pretest knowledge of family members regarding lithium therapy in experimental and control group. 2) To assess the posttest knowledge of family members regarding lithium therapy in experimental and control group. 3) To find out the effectiveness of psycho education on lithium therapy of family members in experimental group. 4) To compare the pretest and posttest knowledge of family members regarding lithium therapy between experimental and control group. 5) To find out the relationship between pretest knowledge of family members regarding lithium and selected demographic variables. Hypotheses: There will be a significant difference between knowledge of family members regarding lithium therapy before and after psycho education intervention programme. 1) There will be a significant difference in the knowledge gained by the family members through the psycho education delivered by different health professionals regarding lithium therapy. 2) There will be a significant association between knowledge of family members and selected demographic variables. The conceptual frame work for the present study was based on J.W. Kemy\u2019s open system model, which guided the investigator to help the family members to gain adequate knowledge about lithium therapy. A quasi experimental design was adopted for the study the independent variable was psycho education on lithium therapy and the dependent variables was level of knowledge. The study was conducted for a period of one year. Two hundred and fifty family members of patients with lithium therapy, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were selected for the study knowledge was assessed by structured knowledge questionnaire regarding lithium therapy. The tool was validated by experts in various field of Nursing, Medicine and Statistician. Purposive sampling technique was used to select the sample subjects. The sample size was estimated by power analysis. The sample size was 125 for each group (experimental and control group). The psycho education was delivered by the investigator to experimental group and for control group psycho education was delivered by ANM for 30 minutes. The investigator adhered to human right beneficence and non-malfeasance, dignity, confidentiality and justice. The major findings of the study: In the assessment of level of knowledge among family members of patient with lithium therapy in experimental group it was found that, in the pretest 96.8% family members had inadequate knowledge, 3.2% family members had moderately adequate knowledge and none of family members had adequate knowledge. In the posttest 74.4% family members had adequate knowledge and 24% family members had moderately adequate knowledge and 1.6% family members had inadequate knowledge in the experimental group. 1) While assessing the level of knowledge among family members of patient with lithium therapy in control group. In the pretest 92% of family members had inadequate knowledge and 8.0% of family members had moderately adequate knowledge and none of them had adequate knowledge. In the posttest 58.4% of family members had inadequate knowledge, 40.8% of family members had moderately adequate knowledge and 0.8% had adequate knowledge. 2) It is evident from the findings of the study that the mean score and standard deviation of pretest knowledge score was 6.2 \u00b1 2.4 and after administration of psycho education the knowledge score was 18.2 \u00b1 2.9. The mean difference was 12 \u00b1 3.1 and the \u2018t\u2019 test value was t = 42.784 and this is greater than the table value at p < 0.001. This reveals that there is a significance difference in pretest and post test score in experimental group. 3) The findings of the study reveals that the pretest mean and standard deviation knowledge score of family members of patient with lithium therapy in control group was 6.6 \u00b1 2.5, the same after administration of psycho education post test score was 10.6 \u00b1 2.2. The mean difference was 4 \u00b1 2.4 and the \u2018t\u2019 test value was 19.066 and this is greater than the table value at p < 0.001. This reveals that there is a significance difference in pretest and posttest. 4) The findings of the study show that while comparing the knowledge among family members of patients with lithium therapy in experimental group and control group. The mean and standard deviation of experimental group was 12\u00b13.1 and control group was 4\u00b1 2.4. The mean difference was 8 and \u2018t\u2019 test value was t = 22.853. The mean reduction of experimental group was highly significant than the control group. 5) There is no significant association between pretest level of knowledge among family members of patient with lithium therapy and selected demographic variables such as age, sex, type of relationship, education, monthly income, occupation and marital status except religion and type of family in experimental group. 6) Paper ID: SR21830123423 DOI: 10.21275/SR21830123423 668 International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR) ISSN: 2319-7064 SJIF (2020): 7.803 Volume 10 Issue 10, October 2021 www.ijsr.net Licensed Under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY There is no significant association between pretest level of knowledge among family members of patient with lithium therapy and selected demographic variable such as age, sex, type of relationship with patient, education, monthly income, occupation, marital status, religion and type of family in control group.",

    "title": "Capacity Enhancement in Rock and Tunnel Engineering in Nepal",
    "abstract": "In the recent past, infrastructure development activities have gained momentum in Nepal. Many roads are being and will be upgraded to enhance transport efficiency. The hydropower development activities are in full momentum. However, often occurring natural hazards caused by monsoon rain and large-scale earthquakes are major challenges to Nepal\u2019s infrastructure and resilience hydropower projects. Developing an efficient transport network functioning in allweather conditions and resilience hydropower is not possible without the construction of tunnels. The experience indicates that the construction cost for tunnels is considerably higher due to insufficient capacity and knowledge base within Nepal and dependency on foreign agencies who have limited knowledge on the Himalayan geological condition. It is important to enhance ability through specialized high-level education and research within Rock and Tunnel Engineering (both MSc and Ph.D. Levels). This manuscript discusses a new curriculum developed for MSc education in Rock and Tunnel Engineering for the Institute of Engineering (IoE) of Tribhuvan University with the direct help from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), which helped to start the MSc program and first batch of students are enrolled for the academic year 2020/2021 at IoE-WRC Pokhara. NTNU collaborates with IoE through a research grant NORHED II Project 70141 6; Capacity Enhancement in Rock and Tunnel Engineering in Nepal received from the Norwegian Agency for Development Aid (NORAD).",

    "title": "Impact Of Covid-19 Pandemic On Body Composition And Daily Energy Expenditure-intake After 6-month Confinement",
    "abstract": "continuous better understand the behavioral changes of U.S. immigrants and predict their health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic represents far-reaching health threats, consequently, some governments took extraordinary measures where the main guidelines included social confinement and suspension of school presential activities, resulting in changes in habitual practices of university students such daily energy expenditure and food intake. PURPOSE : To determine the changes on daily energy expenditure and food intake in 10 health sciences university students after 6-month isolation by COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS : Anthropometric parameters, a daily physical activity questionnaire, and a nutritional survey were obtained one week before the isolation by COVID-19 pandemic and after 6-months of confinement. Changes of body mass index, daily energy expenditure, and daily energy intake (daily total calories, total protein, total lipids, and total carbohydrates) were compared before and after the study period. RESULTS : The main outcomes are described in Table 1. CONCLUSIONS : Confinement by COVID-19 in university students showed a decrease in health status due to increased consumption of calories, specifically lipids, which results in an increase in body mass index, impacting in a greater risk of being affected by the coronavirus, in addition to being one of the main risk factors for suffering from cardiovascular diseases. Finally, even though there didn\u2019t exist statistical difference, there can be appreciated a tendency to decrease daily energy expenditure. both few CVD risk factor, peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak ), and 1-RM chest and leg press were also assessed. RESULTS : A total of 381 participants (94%) completed the study with 83% average exercise attendance rate. After adjusting for age, sex, and baseline value using the intention-to-treat analysis, the overall CVD risk score decreased in CE (-0.16) and AE (-0.15), but not in RE (-0.05), compared to the control (p<0.05 for between group differences). Percent body fat decreased in CE (-1.2%), AE (-1.0%), and RE (-1.0%) compared to the control (p<0.001). Although there were no group differences at 1-year, SBP and LDL-C decreased in CE (-2.3 mmHg, -7.2 mg/dl) (p<0.05 for within group differences), but not significantly in AE (-1.5 mmHg, -4.9 mg/dl) and RE (-1.2 mmHg, -0.8 mg/dl). Fasting glucose increased at 1-year in RE (p=0.01), but no between and within group differences were found in other groups. VO 2peak increased in AE (8%), CE (6%), and RE (1%) compared to the control (p<0.05). Both 1-RM chest and leg press increased in RE (18%, 19%) and CE (11%, 10%), but not in AE (-2%, 3%), compared to the control (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS : One-year CE and AE, but not RE, improved overall CVD risk score compared to the control in adults at high risk of CVD. PURPOSE High level of sedentary behavior (SB) may cause a number of health complaints (nHC) and lead to reduced self-rated health (SRH) in young people. RESULTS : Out of the participants, 54% were female and 46% were male with the mean age of 22\u00b14 years (16-29 years). The mean SES was 9.3\u00b12.2 (1-13), BMI was 23\u00b14 kg/m\u00b2 (14-47 kg/m\u00b2), severity of the nHC was 9\u00b16 (0-32), and SRH was 1.8\u00b10.6 (1-5). The multiple regression analysis shows that high SB through leisure is associated with more severe nHC (unstandardized coefficient b=.49, p<.01). However, PA can decrease nHC (b=.39, p<.01) for participants with high leisure SB. No association has been found between SRH, BMI, and leisure SB. Furthermore, an increase in SB through gaming is associated with higher BMI (b=.35, p<.01) and worse SRH (b=.09, p<.00). A relationship between the severity of nHC and gaming is not found. In all cases, a higher PA shows a significantly better nHC, SRH, and BMI. CONCLUSIONS : The results show that PA has a positive moderating effect of the relationship on leisure SB and nHC in young people in Luxembourg. Increased SB causes higher nHC, worse SRH, and higher BMI and young people who do more PA have lower severity in nHC, and better BMI and SRH. Therefore, it is important for young people to reduce SB and implement a sufficient amount of PA to improve overall health. PURPOSE : Moderate evidence indicates a beneficial effect of self-reported physical activity on risk of lung cancer. However, few studies have evaluated lung cancer risk in relation to cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), expressed as peak metabolic equivalents (METs), an objective marker of recent physical activity habits and less prone to misclassification. We aimed to assess the association between CRF and risk of lung cancer and to determine whether this association varies by smoking status. METHODS : Male (N=552,560) and female (N=39,556) US Veterans (age 61.3\u00b19.5) completed a symptom-limited exercise treadmill test (ETT) between 1999-2020 using the Bruce protocol. All had no history of cancer prior to ETT. After 8,735 subjects with missing data were excluded, we established five CRF categories based on age-specific quintiles of peak METs achieved: Least-Fit (n=98,473); Low-Fit (n=142,134); Moderate-Fit (n=109,368); Fit (n=136,726) and High-Fit (n=96,680). Multivariable Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for lung cancer events across CRF categories. RESULTS : During the follow-up period (median=8.8 years), 7,391 individuals (age 64.3\u00b17.9) developed lung cancer (14 events/10,000 person-years of observation). After adjustment for age, gender, race, and body mass index, the risk of lung cancer declined progressively with higher CRF status and followed a similar pattern in smokers and non-smokers. For smokers, when compared to the Least-Fit, Low-Fit individuals had a 27% lower risk of lung cancer incidence (HR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.67-0.79). For Moderate-fit, Fit and High-fit individuals the risk was lower by 45% (HR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.50-0.61); 66% (HR 0.44; 95% CI: 0.42-0.52) and 70% (HR 0.30; 95% CI: 0.26-0.34), respectively. Similarly, for non-smokers lung cancer risk was lower by 29% (HR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.66-0.78), 45% (HR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.50-0.60); 58% (HR 0.42; 95% CI: 0.38-0.47) and 71% (HR 0.29; 95% CI: 0.26-0.33), respectively. CONCLUSIONS : The CRF-lung cancer incidence association was inverse and followed a dose-response pattern for both smokers and non-smokers. These findings underscore the importance of promoting higher CRF, presumably through greater physical activity, in the prevention of lung cancer. PURPOSE : Compositional data analysis has been applied to behavioral time-use data. However, no study has applied compositional data analysis to examine how the proportion of school day pedometer steps accrued during specific school segments relates to a health outcome. The purpose of this study was to apply compositional data analysis to examine the association between segmented school step count compositions and body mass index (BMI) z-scores in a sample of children. METHODS : Participants were 855 (51.8% female) children recruited from the fourth and fifth grades from four public elementary schools following a 7-h school schedule. Using piezoelectric pedometers, step count data were collected during physical education, recess, lunch, and during the academic class time. Using the framework of compositional data analysis, a multi-level general linear mixed effects model associated the step count composition with BMI z-scores, adjusting for grade level, sex, race/ethnicity, the clustering of students within classrooms and the clustering of classrooms within schools. Compositional isotemporal substitution was then used to determine changes in BMI z-scores per reallocation of steps between pairs of school segments. RESULTS : A higher percentage of steps accrued during physical education (\u03b2 = -0.34, 95%CI: -0.65 - -0.03, p = 0.036) and recess (\u03b2 = -0.47, 95%CI: -0.83 - -0.11, p = 0.012), relative to other segments, associated with lower BMI z-scores. Specifically, a 5% to 15% reallocation of steps accrued during lunch time to either physical education or recess associated with lower BMI z-scores ranging from -0.07 to -0.41 standard deviation units. CONCLUSIONS : Using compositional data analysis, it was found that a higher percentage of steps accrued during physical education and recess associated with lower BMI z-scores in children. Reallocation of steps between school segments may yield meaningful reductions in BMI z-scores. The results highlight the potential health-related importance of accumulating steps during physical education and recess relative to other school segments. BACKGROUND: Emergence of the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) impacted the population\u2019s health behaviors. The influence of local shut downs and interpersonal regulations on physical activity and sedentary behaviors in college-aged students is not understood. investigate in physical activity and sedentary identify barriers to physical activity among during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic Physical activity sedentary estimated a lockdown using the Activity Questionnaire for Adults and (AQuAA). Barriers to physical activity during the pandemic were assessed in May using 8 that participants Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests were used to examine changes in the AQuAA before and during the pandemic. Frequencies were used to examine the number of respondents citing the same top barrier to physical activity.",

    "title": "From professor to patient X.",
    "abstract": "I walked into the classroom feeling nervous. It wasn't my first time teaching undergraduate students about human endocrine physiology. I knew the material well. But today's lecture was different. I pulled up slides depicting a hypothetical cancer patient and told them, \u201cPatient X had a biopsy that detected invasive carcinoma in her breast.\u201d I described the many months of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatments she went through before going into remission. Then I taught the students about the hormonal therapy she was prescribed\u2014drugs her doctor hoped would limit the growth of any remaining cancer cells and prevent a recurrence. On the final slide, I showed them a picture of me on my last day of chemotherapy. \u201cI am patient X,\u201d I revealed.\n\n\n\n> \u201cI wanted my students to see me as a person first and a professor second.\u201d \n\nWhen I started my faculty position, I never would have dreamed of giving a lecture that delved into my personal medical history. I made a point of presenting myself as a consummate professional to my students and colleagues. I was only 28 years old\u2014fresh out of my Ph.D. program\u2014and I wanted to be respected as a professor.\n\nBut that all changed in the second year of my faculty position, when I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. I continued to work while I underwent treatment, which meant that signs of my chemotherapy, such as hair loss, were clearly visible. I told undergraduate students in my classes about my condition, in part to cut short curious stares but also to warn them that my treatment could interfere with my teaching.\n\nI appreciated the compassion and care those students showed me\u2014putting together care packages, leaving cards, praying for my recovery. I was taken aback by their maturity and empathy\u2014and reminded that they are people, too. They may have a mother or grandmother who suffered from breast cancer. They may have religious beliefs that call them to pray.\n\nWhen my hair grew back, I didn't want to return to being the same professor I was before. I wanted my students to see me as a person first and a professor second, and I hoped my story would show them that the science they were learning had relevance in the real world. So 1 year after my diagnosis, I developed my lecture about patient X.\n\nFor nearly 5 years, I gave that lecture, with the positive news that I was in remission: \u201cThe power of medicine!\u201d I'd tell them. The nerves never went away\u2014I found it emotionally trying to talk about my body and my disease\u2014but I persisted because the lecture was clearly making an impact. Each time, a few students would stay after class or send me an email, making it clear they appreciated my honesty.\n\nThen, in March 2020\u2014just as most people's lives were upended by the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014I got a call from my oncologist. My cancer was back, and it had spread. I was now facing a diagnosis of stage 4 metastatic disease. It was hard news to hear, but I decided to continue my teaching, research, and service activities because I felt the same physically as I did before. I also thought my work would be a welcome distraction from the stress of doctor's visits, tests, and scans.\n\nIt was time to update patient X's story. At first, I added details about new lines of hormonal treatment and an unfulfilling ending of \u201ctime will tell.\u201d More recently, I added somewhat more optimistic news: Patient X's third-line treatment of infusion chemotherapy seems to be working a bit. The metastatic nodules in her lungs have decreased in size and number, and she might have access to new treatment options in the future.\n\nMy diagnosis has likely shortened the number of years I will have to build and leave a legacy as a scientist, mentor, and teacher. Yet, it has also given me a powerful tool. It helps me connect with my students on a personal level, tap into their empathy, and show them why the material they're learning matters. It isn't easy to be vulnerable with my students. But I believe my personal story is one of the most important lessons I teach all semester.",

    "abstract": "Since the middle of 1990s, Malaysia has already showed its commitment and emphasis on the idea of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) is being developed in order to satisfy the country's ambition to achieve the fully developed status by the year 2020. Recent studies showed that online learning for secondary students had become more established and accepted as a standard way of learning nowadays. Educators are always being encouraged to incorporate technology into their classroom teaching. 3D interactions with multimedia elements relatively allow the learners to learn and grasp the lessons being taught much faster than in a normal classroom. The use of computer training tools where the student can interact with a computer model can give good feedbacks. 3D analytical approach is especially useful in determining the fundamental molecular events using a Web-based, visually-oriented system that allows efficient querying of gene expression. The implementation of VRML is perceivably efficient and effective method for conveying molecular models over the net. In molecular science, 3D impressions and conceptions are elementary in order to transfer and understand further complex structural information. A prototype of an interactive 3D multimedia learning tool in Biology was created in order to provide users with a 3D element multimedia study environment in Biology subject. The prototype contains three main divisions which are the 3DiC, animations and tutorials. It allows users to learn and study about the biological cells and animations in an interactive and interesting 3D environment.",

    "title": "Is Vietnam ready for nuclear power?",
    "abstract": "V demand on power supply is increasing rapidly along with economic growth. It is a matter of urgency for Vietnam to find alternative energy source other than fossil fuel in order to minimize the influence on local climate. Currently the world\u2019s largest nuclear power market exists in emerging economies and developing countries as those countries are in great need of relatively cheap energy to drive its economic growth. But nuclear power, neither cheap nor safe, is putting those countries in a dilemma. As the hot spot of the nuclear power market shifted from \u201cadvanced technology\u201d to \u201ceconomic affordability\u201d, how to find a comprehensive nuclear power solution for developing countries with specific requirements poses a serious question to the international community. Demand on power supply grows by 14% per year and the growth is expected to reach 15% in Vietnam until 2015. Vietnam relies on hydro power, which accounts for 36.04% of national power supply in 2009. Short of other energy resources, it will be very difficult for Vietnam to meet the country\u2019s power demand in the future only with hydro power and power converted from fossil fuels (such as oil, coal and natural gas). Nuclear power supply, an efficient option that addresses power shortage without emitting greenhouse gases, is still a powerful attraction to developing countries represented by Vietnam. Vietnam announced its ambitious nuclear power program that is scheduled to grow from one reactor in 2020 to 10 reactors by 2030 in which nuclear contribution to the national grid will be 1.5% in 2020, 8% in 2030, and 20\u221225% by 2050. Vietnam\u2019s first nuclear power plant, located at Phuoc Dinh, is supplied by Atom Story Export from Russia. Its second, at Vinh Hai, is supplied by JAPC from Japan. As a developing country, the only thing Vietnam could do is to make nuclear power an integral part of the national grid and at the same time ensure its safety and security. Russia and Japan promised to provide aid package to Vietnam in order to meet Vietnam\u2019s requirements on funds, technology, nuclear fuel, power plant construction and operation, etc., as Vietnam does not have the basic elements to develop nuclear power on its own. Developing countries as Vietnam must put nuclear safety and security on the first place and conduct researches on nuclear accidents in history, for example, Chernobyl, Fukushima, etc., the influence of natural disasters on nuclear power plants prior to developing nuclear energy. To keep a nuclear power plant running smoothly and safely, it is also necessary to build a team of nuclear experts, engineers, professionals, and operators. It takes years or decades for a country to master the essence of nuclear science and technology, depending on a country\u2019s existing infrastructure. Since nuclear professionals are scarce in developing countries, Vietnam should add more nuclear engineering courses in colleges and universities to enlarge the scope of basic nuclear education and professional training. Government should invest more funds to support domestic training institutions and conduct cooperation programs with foreign counterparts to develop its indigenous nuclear professionals. The location of nuclear power plant is very important. According to local meteorological experts, the nuclear power plant in Ninh Thuan province is under the threat of tsunami. To minimize the influence of tsunami, the government should build a tsunami and earthquake warning center and establish a tsunami forecast system. Even if the nuclear power program is kicked off with sufficient funds and technologies, any delay in the phase of engineering construction will bring about disastrous and unimaginable consequences to a developing country like Vietnam. In the case of France\u2019s EPR project, EDF announced a revised cost estimate of EUR 6 billion caused by delay, set against cost estimate of EUR 5 billion in 2010. A lesson learned from the Fukushima experience shows the way the Government and Nuclear Safety Agency supervise and regulate the management and operation of a nuclear power plant is of great importance to its safety and security. We think that it is difficult to establish a perfect nuclear management system with high safety standards in such a short period of time. A former director of the Dalat Nuclear Research Institute emphasized a bad safety culture is prevailing in every field of the country, as is shown by frequent traffic accidents in",

    "title": "Notes from the Editors",
    "abstract": "F our years ago, unexpected news broke that for the first time since 1905 a European-based team would take over the editorial duties of the American Political Science Review, the premier political science outlet of the American Political Science Association. Experiencing Brexit, \u201cAmerica First,\u201d and the rise of nativism in the period of our editorship, the slogan \u201cGoing Global\u201d of this British and German collaboration sounds anachronistic today. But four years have come and gone, andwhile our editorship has ended, the APSR continues to attract more global readership and contributions from authors and reviewers. In our concluding Notes from the Editors, we would like to present not only the statistics you all have grown accustomed to reading but also a recap of our experience before signing off from what has been a fulfilling and challenging adventure. In particular, we wish to thank all the people\u2014authors, reviewers, board members, editors, producers, and organizers\u2014who have contributed to and supported our \u201cgoodoldEurope\u201d editorship. Thank you! Independent from the global development of our scholarship, we noticed in the beginning of our editorship that other political science outlets had found increasing recognition and were outperforming theAPSR.According to theprominent five-year impact factor (IF),APSA\u2019s premier political science outlet steadily declined from 2012 (IF: 3.933) to 2017 (IF: 3.252), dropping from the 1st to the 10th position of political science journals if ranked by their impact factor. In response to this negative trend, we emphasized our dedication to publishing scholarly research of exceptional merit in the APSR, covering all disciplinary fields of political science, which should demonstrate the highest pluralist standard of excellence in scholarly political science analysis. But how to realize this ambitious goal in an academic world with higher publication competition and more specialized \u201cexcellence\u201d while acknowledging that the overall submission pool continues to grow? In essence, we tackled this challenge from two sides: one, by reorganizing the internal decisionmaking process of the APSR mainly to reduce editorial subfield differences and, two, by reforming the publication model to increase the outreach of the journal. With regard to the former, we started small, first by improving the effectiveness, fairness, and transparency of our double-blind review process. For this purpose, we reorganized our decision-making procedure by installing a lead editor to generate more oversight vis-\u00e1-vis the field-specific associate editors. This model aimed at overcoming individual differences in responding to reviewers\u2019 recommendations. Furthermore, we carefully read the reviews instead of only counting recommendations; we justified our editorial decisions by sending out all the reviews to authors and reviewers, and we reevaulated when authors challenged our decisions by assigning a third editor. Last but not least, we began increasing desk rejections of manuscripts that do not satisfy the conditions outlined in our guidelines to relieve the burden felt by our reviewer pool. With regard to the latter, we moved to a FirstView online publicationmodel for accepted articles, allowing publishedwork to reach our readership and community faster; which is particularly important for younger scholars where every published article counts towards establishing their career. We also established anAPSR Dataverse to open the channels of data sharing and reproduction. This should also enhance the visibility and confidence in the reliability of our publications. Moreover, we introduced the publication format of letters, which are shorter, more focused, demonstrate a novel perspective on existing research, and encourage scholarly debate. Today, letters account for more than 10% of submissions and publications. Only the future will tell whether these changes and four years of hard (team)work were ultimately enough to reverse the negative trend that we observed in the beginning of our editorship. While the most recent 2018 impact factor shows that the APSR\u2019s score is increasing again, we have to wait until the 2019 impact factor is published in 2020 to see our impact. Regardless, we are confident because other measures, such as the Altmetric Score, indicate increasing attention to our articles. For example, two out of the 10 most trending political science papers published in the past year were published in the APSR\u2014more than from any other journal. One final, noticeable change was an update of these very editorial notes in each issue to explore external debates in academia with trends present in our journal. We followed our promise not only to be transparent with our decisions but also to provide empirical insights into our processes by reporting on statistics of, at times, controversial issues\u2014after all, getting published in the APSR is and always has been a rare outcome for submitting authors. In these final notes, we have the opportunity to review onemore time some of themajor trends and challenges we have been facing\u2014most notable for us was possibly the continuous increase in submission rates. During our editorship, we received a total of 4,616 submissions, of which 3,987 were articles (86%) and 629 were letters (14%)\u2014an impressive share within a short time, which highlights the general acceptance of this newly introduced format.

    "abstract": "Objective: Acinetobacter spp. infection is a challenging problem in intensive care unit (ICU) because of its multi-drug resistant (MDR) in nature to antibiotic therapy including broadspectrum carbapenem group. The aims of the study were to determine the risk factors of mortality and the outcome of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. (CRAs) infection in our ICU. \nMaterials and Method: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional study, done in 2 years from January 2008 to December 2009. The list of the patients was obtained from hospital nosocomial infection surveillance unit and ICU infection record. The data of the patients were subsequently reviewed from their respective medical records after approval from university ethics committee and hospital medical record unit. \nResults and Discussion: A total of 92 patients were reviewed and only 54 were included and analyzed. The prevalence of CRAs over 24 months was 7.3%. Mortality was 50% among the reviewed patients and this contributed 13.6 % of the total ICU mortality. Age was significantly different between survival and non-survival groups; 43.07 (21.09) vs. 57.04 \u00b1 14.33 year old (p = 0.006). Age was also the only significant independent risk factor associated with mortality in CRAs (adjusted OR = 1.045, 95% CI: 1.010, 1.081, p = 0.011). There were no other significant risk factors. The length of ICU stay was 17.00 (13.58) days whereas length of hospital stay was 41.37 (27.66) days in survival group. \nConclusion: CRAs caused 13.6% of total ICU mortality and older age group was the independent risk factor for mortality. \nBangladesh Journal of Medical Science Vol.19(1) 2020 p.98-104",

    "abstract": "by FRANClNE FRANKLIN HEALTH CORRESPONDENT The Federal Government released today a study that shows an alarming increase in \"Specific Subject Aphasias\", a new brain ailment that is affecting Americans age forty and over. Specific Subject Aphasias or SSA's as they are now commonly called, cause the patient to lose the ability to communicate and process information in specific subject areas. For example, one SSA victim might lose the ability to compose music after a lifetime of work in musical composition while another SSA victim might forget how to spell or to do arithmetic. The symptoms are varied, but scientists are quite sure that we are seeing the development of a new, devastating disease whose cause has yet to be determined. However, there is a growing suspicion that SSA's are somehow related to the increasing human dependence upon computer technology. The federal study showed that there were 119,450 new cases of SSA in the United States during 2027, as compared to about 99,087 new cases in the previous year, which, according to my wrist calculator, represents an increase of about 20%. SSA's are fast becoming the number one health concern among older Americans, now that Alzheimer's disease has more or less been cured by the use of drug therapies and changes in life style. Alzhe imer ' s reached its peak during the 1990s and 2000s. Late in the 1990s scientists proved that Alzheimer's had a variety of causes, some environmental and some genetic. Changes in lifestyle alone, including engagement in a lifelong program of creative activities and reduced television viewing, helped to e l iminate nearly half of all Alzheimer 's cases. Powerful drugs that stimulate the growth of neurons and atrophied dendritic connections helped to eliminate almost all of the remaining Alzheimer's cases by 2020. Ironically, it was during the year 2020 that the first cases of SSA were diagnosed. Actually, SSA's were probably around since as early as 2000, but not in sufficient numbers to raise concern. However, by 2020 the medical establishment realized that an ailment that could be potentially devastating to human cognitive and intellectual abilities was raging through the population. Unlike Alzheimer's, which affected mostly senior citizens, SSA's affect people starting around age forty, although SSA's are also of concern to the senior population. SSA's cause a patient to \"black out\" in certain subject areas. For example, one SSA patient that we interviewed had been a composer of show tunes. However, as computers became to be used more frequently in composing show tunes and other forms of music, this patient found that his own music composition skills were diminishing. Now, this patient cannot remember or communicate even the most rudimentary rules of musical composition. Indeed, he has lost the ability to read and write musical notation. Yet, his disability is specific to musical knowledge. Outside of this specific domain his memory and his communications skills are perfectly normal. Thus, this ailment is called \"specific subject aphasia\", aphasia being the medical term that applies when a patient can no longer speak. Some researchers have noted that these aphasias are often in areas that were once a passionate interest in a patient's life. For example, the composer that we alluded to had once been very passionate about composing music. He told us that it was a great blow to his ego when a computer system beat him in a competition to provide music for the Broadway show, O.J., that eventually became a major hit. There is growing evidence that SSA's are a direct consequence of human dependence upon computer technology. This theory was first posed by Dr. Arlene Totter at the 2024 International SSA Conference. Her theory is that SSA's are the result of a global deterioration in the microscopic physiology of the human brain that is a direct consequence of human dependence upon computer technology. Earlier this year, at the 2028 International SSA Conference that was held in Buenos Aires, researchers from Oxford University in England have come up with the first concrete evidence that the human brain is changing on a planetary scale due to the use of computer technology, as predicted by Professor Trotter's theory. This work is the research of Drs. Stephen Falcon and Isabella Wilson. Drs. Falcon and Wilson have detected a change in human brain structure in the period 2017-2027 that they attribute to the growing dependence upon computer technology. Many scientists expect Drs. Falcon and Wilson to earn the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. Their research takes us to the cutting edge of brain research. Drs. Falcon and Wilson discovered specific patterns of brain deterioration that they believe is proof of a theory that was presented in the 1980s by British biologist Rupert Sheldrake . Sheldrake postulated that learning is a species-wide phenomenon. According to Sheldrake, when one thousand people learn some new technology, the entire human race is actually learning that new technology on some level. Once a critical mass of pioneers learn that new technology, that learning transfers more easily to the rest of humanity, because all human beings arise from a common biological field that is bePlease see APHASIAS, p. 47",

    "title": "Research and Practice of Teaching Mode in Total-English for Foreign Students in Agricultural Colleges and Universities",
    "abstract": "In the past, overseas students who studied in China mainly studied in liberal arts and medicine. With the improvement of China's scientific and technological innovation ability and economic strength, agricultural colleges have gradually become the growth point attracting foreign students to China. The biggest learning obstacle for foreign students in China is the language barrier. All the time, total-English teaching has become the main mode for foreign students in China. There are some problems when teaching in full English for foreign students to study in China. The teaching mode of foreign students in English is studied and analyzed combined with the author\u2019s own teaching experience in this paper. At the same time, how to improve the training quality of foreign students in agricultural universities in China from the perspective of language is discussed and Suggestions for improvement are presented, which provides reference for improving the training quality of foreign students in agricultural universities. 1. The Significance of Recruiting Foreign Students in Chinese Universities Under the background of global economic integration and education internationalization, colleges and universities play the role of bridge and link in strengthening and promoting international exchanges and cooperation, and colleges and universities play an increasingly important role in international exchanges. China's colleges and universities have recruited foreign students for dozens of years, with the development of our country science and technology and economy, as well as the rapid improvement in overall national strength, the increasing size of students from abroad, foreign students by early coming to China to study minority disciplines such as Chinese and medicine, gradually expanded to science, engineering, agriculture, and many other disciplines. The overseas students in China have enhanced the exchanges between China and other countries in knowledge, education. science and technology, promoted the spread of Chinese culture and values worldwide, which had far-reaching significance in expanding China's influence and international status and cultivating China's friendship with other countries. According to the \u2018study in China plan\u2019 issued by the ministry of education in 2010, China will receive 150,000 overseas students for higher education each year by 2020, which is the overall strategic goal and direction of overseas students education. Education for overseas students is an important part of China's higher education and plays a vital role in the development of China's higher education. Education of a foreign student in China has accelerated the internationalization of institutions of higher learning and improved the competitiveness of institutions of higher learning to participate in international education. It has gradually become an important teaching work for institutions of higher learning. At the same time, it also puts forward more strict and standard requirements for the teaching work of foreign students in China. Where, the training quality of foreign students in China is the core issue of education, and the teaching quality is directly related to the development of education. [1-4] 2. Problems in the Totally English Teaching Mode of Foreign Students in Agricultural Colleges Compared with the Chinese language and medicine, agricultural colleges and universities have been carrying out the overseas recruitment work relatively late. At present, the education quality of foreign students in Chinese agricultural universities is relatively low due to language barriers, relatively low quality of students and inconsistent teaching system. Among them, the language barrier should be the primary problem that foreign students have to face in the learning process of domestic agricultural colleges and universities in China, and it is also the core content that restricts the training quality of foreign students in China .[5] At present, domestic colleges and universities mainly adopt the total-English teaching mode for the cultivation of overseas students in China. The advantage of total-English teaching lies in that it greatly overcomes the language barrier in the teaching process of overseas students in China, so that students do not have to worry about language problems, because most of them have a certain English foundation. Some people suggest that another advantage of total-English teaching is that it is convenient for overseas students to choose jobs. Graduates majoring in total-English teaching will be favored by Chinese and foreign multinationals. Actually, it remains to be seen, because Chinese universities do not have an advantage in terms of the language of instruction. The location and working mode of the overseas students who come to China after graduation can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category is to come back to their own countries to work after graduation; The second category is working in China or engaging in work related to China exchanges; The third is working in other countries where English is the official language. Among the three types of working places and ways of working after the graduation of foreign students in China, total-English teaching can not be beneficial to the former two. For the third party, the total-English teaching in China is difficult to show advantages for the graduates who are studying in the country where English is the official language. On the contrary, the total-English teaching of domestic agricultural colleges for foreign students in China has gradually exposed some disadvantages, which have seriously affected the quality of foreign students' training, which is embodied in the following aspects: A. Foreign students pay insufficient attention to Chinese learning. Because overseas students do not have the pressure of learning Chinese language, naturally, the motivation to learn Chinese is not high. Many overseas students have been studying in China for two or three years, but they still cannot communicate with Chinese teachers and students normally. B. The insufficient Chinese language level affects the daily life of overseas students, who are not good at dealing with problems in their study life and rely on the management staff of overseas students to a large extent, which brings inconvenience to the management of overseas students in the colleges and universities. For example, most of the staff in the dining hall, dormitory and other departments can't speak English or their English level is not high, which makes it difficult to communicate with foreign students. Even if it is little important, the staff should stay in charge to help them, which greatly affects the management efficiency of foreign students. C.The difficulties of the daily communication between foreign students and Chinese teachers and students limit the influence of Chinese culture on foreign students studying in China. Because language is the carrier of culture, it is hard to understand the essence and connotation of Chinese history and culture without owing Chinese, which is a great loss for overseas students and also greatly limits the purpose of overseas students recruitment by Chinese government. In addition, English is not the mother tongue in China. Chinese teachers have a congenital deficiency in teaching in English. Although they can have the ability to teach in English through hard work, they can hardly be as comfortable as their native Chinese. Even if the English level of domestic agricultural teachers reaches the level of domestic English professional teachers, it is difficult to satisfy the overseas students in China. 3. Suggestions on Improvement of Total-English Teaching Mode for Undergraduate Students in Agricultural Universities In view of the defects exposed in the total-English teaching mode of foreign students in agricultural colleges at present, aiming at improving the training quality of foreign students in agricultural colleges, the related improvement work can be started from the following aspects: 3.1 Strengthening Chinese Learning Chinese is a tool for Chinese people to communicate, a symbol of Chinese culture, and a major information carrier for overseas students to communicate in China as well. Only by learning Chinese well, overseas students in China can finish their studies better and gain more. Strengthening the importance of learning Chinese to foreign students in agricultural colleges and universities, by Chinese language training, curriculum setting, incentives and other a variety of ways to raise the Chinese level of the overseas students, to let foreign students from the English listening to the lectures in Chinese as early as possible and realize foreign students and Chinese students studying in the same class as soon as possible, let the foreign students be real harmony among students studying life atmosphere, and promote the knowledge of the culture communication between Chinese students and overseas students. 3.2 Strengthen the Cultural Influence on Foreign Students Setting up Chinese culture to the Chinese general course and the elective courses, such as calligraphy, painting, cooking, martial arts, such as organizing some historical and cultural landscape tour to satisfy foreign students curiosity about Chinese culture, stimulate the students love of Chinese culture, let the foreign students in learning Chinese is familiar with Chinese culture and enhance their foreign language level in the understanding of Chinese culture. 3.3 Increase the Pre-Education Time The original living environment and local education situation of foreign students in China are quite different from that of Chinese students. Foreign students directly study in Chinese universities will definitely cause a lot of inadaptability to living habits and learning atmosphere. Therefore, it is very important for foreign students to properly arrange the preparatory courses for half ",

IDC predicts that by 2020, the company's expenditure based on big data computing and analysis platform will exceed 500 billion US dollars, and the compound growth rate will reach 34.1% in the next 5 years; in the next 3 to 5 years, China needs 1.8 million data talents, but currently only About 300,000 people. At the same time, China's colleges and universities in cloud computing, data science and other majors are still in their infancy, and the talents cultivated each year are far from meeting the needs of the industry. Therefore, it is imperative to open a big data major and accelerate the cultivation of talents. The financial industry is the industry that relies most on data and is the easiest to realize data. In recent years, emerging financial institutions such as consumer loans and P2P are the products of the combination of big data technology and finance. At present, the demand for big data talents in finance is extremely strong in China. Only Internet finance is one year, and the growth rate is 3-5 times per year. It is generally believed that there will be a gap of 1 million talents in Internet finance, and the most lacking is big data risk control talents, including data mining and statistical modeling talents from primary to advanced.

    "title": "The Problems and Solutions of the Community Home-Based Old-Age Care Model",
    "abstract": "Community home endowment as a new mode of pension, family pension and social pension to realize combination, it can conform to the objective demands of an ageing population, and also reduce the pension burden of family members, also meet the psychological needs of old people, make them live in the familiar environment at the same time can also accept various community endowment service, this is undoubtedly the most worth extending pension mode. Community endowment patterns, however, there are some problems, so in this paper, through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate home endowment policy,and through the distribution of the questionnaire form, using the quantitative index weight to evaluate endowment patterns, and implementation of the key factors that affecting endowment satisfaction is a person's demand, at last the paper, I put forward some advice to improve community home endowment service level, as well as to increase government support, etc. Introduction China's aging and aging population is pushing up the number of disabled elderly people. However, the institutional pension, family pension and the policies guiding the development of social service market are all in short supply.With the change of urban family structure in China, the situation of 1+2+4(1 family, 2 couples and 4 elderly people) is increasingly prominent.In 2009, Beijing first proposed to improve the city's \"9064\" old-age service model, which is expected to be realized in 2020. In February 2011, the Ministry of Civil Affairs issued the 12th five-year plan for the construction of social old-age care service system, which proposed the pattern of old-age care services \"based on home-based old-age care, supplemented by community old-age care and supported by institutional old-age care\". On the whole the development of China's old-age service system is not very full, unable to meet the increasing pension service demand, and urban and rural old-age service development is not balanced,the pension service development in rural areas is still very insufficient, can't meet the demand of residents endowment service. [1] Therefore, community service is becoming more and more important in old-age care. But the existing community home endowment as a supplement to the traditional mode of pension, the degree and the strength is relatively weak, difficult to meet the needs of the growing diversification pension, especially in the aspects such as the elderly spiritual needs, although community home endowment relative to the other pension mode has some advantages, but because of the service system is not perfect enough, also presented the problems. The problem of old-age care not only needs to be solved by material support, but also includes various problems such as daily care, spiritual comfort, medical care, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the problems existing in the existing community home-based old-age care service and put forward some policy opinions, so as to build a more complete community old-age care service system. Methods In order to analyze the problems existing in the endowment patterns that occupy the home, in this paper, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate home endowment policy and through expert interview and survey, using the quantitative evaluation index weight of pension mode, 5th Annual International Conference on Social Science and Contemporary Humanity Development (SSCHD 2019) Copyright \u00a9 2019, the Authors.

    "abstract": "Ahmed El Goresy died at his home in Heidelberg on October 3, 2019, at the age of 85. Ahmed El Goresy was a highly regarded mineralogist with a worldwide reputation. His research focused on minerals and mineral assemblages of extraterrestrial samples. With his major tool, reflected light microscopy, he studied meteorite samples from asteroids, the Moon, and Mars, and lunar rocks and terrestrial impactites. He was a pioneer in complementing his microscopic findings using scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe, and later the ion probe and Raman spectroscopy. He made numerous discoveries of shock-induced high pressure phases in meteorites and samples from terrestrial impact craters; he detected unusual mineral assemblages in a variety of meteorite types and studied their chemistry and isotopic composition. Ahmed El Goresy obtained his BSc in 1955 in mineralogy and petrology at the University of Heliopolis, Cairo, Egypt. In 1961, he received his PhD for work on ore deposits by using ore microscopy. His supervisor was the famous pioneer of ore microscopy Paul Ramdohr at the University of Heidelberg. Ahmed El Goresy was Ramdohr\u2019s last and best student. In 1961, he briefly returned to Egypt taking a research position in Cairo. In 1963, he became research scientist at the Max-Planck Institut f\u20ac ur Kernphysik in Heidelberg. He then spent some months as guest scientist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and at Harvard University before taking a 2-year postdoctoral fellowship at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. After his return to Germany, he became a senior scientist at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u20ac ur Kernphysik in Heidelberg, and later, he was appointed professor at the Universit\u20acat Heidelberg. In 1998, he officially retired from his position in Heidelberg and moved to the cosmochemistry department of the MaxPlanck-Institut f\u20ac ur Chemie in Mainz. After closure of the cosmochemistry department in 2005, Ahmed El Goresy moved to the Bayerisches Geoinstitut in Bayreuth, where he continued his research projects until August 2017. During some 20 years, Ahmed El Goresy worked in close cooperation with Paul Ramdohr at the MaxPlanck-Institut f\u20ac ur Kernphysik in Heidelberg. Paul Ramdohr, the world-leading scientist in opaque mineralogy, began his studies on meteorites only after he had retired from university in 1958. Ramdohr shared his immense knowledge of opaque minerals and his special skills in reflected light microscopy with Ahmed El Goresy. Werner Schreyer characterized Paul Ramdohr with a few sentences that apply equally well to Ahmed El Goresy: \u201cTwo keen, extremely observant eyes that could recognize the slightest differences in color or brightness; a memory with the quality of a computer to store the observations made; unlike a computer, however, brilliant intelligence that allowed Meteoritics & Planetary Science 55, Nr 2, 457\u2013459 (2020) doi: 10.1111/maps.13432",

    "abstract": "Kupang city is growth rapidly and located in a strategic position between Australia and Timor Leste. A sharp increase of GHG emission along with environmental pollution, contamination of water, air and improper waste disposal practices as its consequence to the global environment. The city\u2019s government ambition to evaluate impact of economic activity on greenhouse gases (GHG) emission contribution. This paper outlined pollutant sectors that contribute substantially to GHG emission in Kupang along with its structure, and count an estimated amount of emission coefficients for 27 economy sectors. More in-depth explanation about indirect coefficient pollutant emission which beneficial not only for calculation of the emission amount but more as inventory data for LCA. The paper is investigated review the trends of some priority sectors, then introduction of indirect coefficients of pollutant sectors, and showed the Pollutant Emission Structure for Kupang. After that, an estimated amount of Kupang GHG emission under BAU is also counted and confirmed. The paper only considers GHG emission issues while air pollutant emission only be provided as inventory data but will not be used as exogenous data for this paper. In the final part a brief explanation and implications of GHG emission policy in Kupang are identified. A detailed of input-output data for individual process are provided includes all groups of processes or industry sectors relevant to economy activities in Kupang City. A time period for Global Warming Potential (GWP) 20 year and 100 years are used to forecasted amounts share of total GHG emission in Kupang and Indonesia by 2020 compared to 2010. As results first, the GHG emission and air pollutant coefficients for 27 sectors in Kupang based on method is presented in NIES which use to count the GHG emission. These also become an Inventory data for researchers of regional science in Indonesia, however, geography and socioeconomic conditions in every region is different, so that some criteria will be applied. Second, found total GHG emission in Kupang is $1.0164\\mathrm{x} 10^{-3}$ Gt or around 0.047% compared to total GHG emission by 2010 and 0.034% compared to total GHG emission by 2020 in Indonesia. The study suggests to government consider a proper method in decide a reliable environmental policy and technical measures to reach GHG emission targets by 2020. Third, total share of CO2e in Indonesia emitted from Kupang for GWP 20 years and 100 years respectively were came out as follow.",

The thought would typically arise when she couldn't bear the weight of the Brussels bureaucracy anymore. Throughout the birth and the 4-year existence of the ERC, scientists' ideas on how to run a funding agency for creative frontier science have clashed with the European Commission's (EC's) rules for managing an international bureaucracy. For the scientific council\u2014a group of 22 heavyweights from across Europe, which Nowotny now chairs\u2014it has been a steep learning curve and a source of deep frustration. Nowotny still has two major tasks to accomplish before she steps down in 2013, at the end of the ERC's first 7-year mandate. One is an overhaul of the organizational structure that she hopes will put it on more solid ground and wrest power away from the officials and politicians of the EC. The other is a substantial hike in the ERC budget for the period from 2014 to 2020.",

    "title": "The torch of Koan: passing on the flame to the future",
    "abstract": "The 88th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) will be held on May 21\u201324, 2015, at Kobe International Convention Center, Kobe International Exhibition Hall, and Kobe Portopia Hotel. The main theme of this congress is \u201cBe Innovative! Toward the World and Toward the Future.\u201d It is a great honor and privilege for Osaka University to host this great congress. We are currently preparing the scientific program very eagerly, aiming to cover the latest advances not only in all aspects of orthopedic surgery but also in other related fields in the health sciences. In addition, we are planning to hold many exciting cultural, sporting, and entertainment events to welcome all of the participants to the congress. \n \nRecently, many remarkable advances in the development of new medications and regenerative medicine have been reported, including iPS cells, which were developed by a JOA member and Nobel Prize laureate, Prof. Shinya Yamanaka. However, so-called \u201cdrug lag\u201d and \u201cdevice lag\u201d are still present in Japan, so patients are not always treated in the most advanced way. On the other hand, Japan\u2019s advanced medical technologies and devices are not prevailing worldwide, and Japan appears to have a much smaller presence in the field of applied clinical medicine than might be expected. In 2020, five\u00a0years after the congress, we will have the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo, and global health needs will have grown. Along with novel scientific insights, global perspectives are necessary, even in our field\u2014orthopedic surgery, and every one of us must contribute to global health. \n \nIn this congress, many colleagues who are devoted to advancing medicine globally will be invited as plenary speakers or symposiasts, and we expect active and exciting discussion in each session. We are also planning to run many instructional course lectures, luncheon seminars, morning and evening seminars, and panel discussions. Many colleagues, including young surgeons and scientists who are devoted to their studies, will be invited to present their updated outcomes. Moreover, common and contemporary orthopedic problems, including locomotive syndrome, will be discussed intensively in many free papers and poster sessions. We hope that all of the participants in the congress will not only clarify the state of the art but also enjoy updates on all types of orthopedic issues. \n \nFollowing last year\u2019s congress, a combined symposium with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons will be held, and hip preservation will be discussed as one of the hot topics in the two countries. This symposium is entitled \u201cHip Preservation: Challenges for Preserving Patient\u2019s Joint by Osteotomy and Arthroscopy.\u201d Furthermore, we are planning an international symposium entitled \u201cTotal Knee Arthroplasty in Asia,\u201d to discuss Asia-specific problems regarding knee arthroplasty with many leading knee surgeons from Asian countries. We expect that many Japanese colleagues as well as participants from many other countries will enjoy the resulting discussion of current orthopedic issues at a truly international level. \n \nOsaka University evolved from Tekijuku, a private school founded in Osaka in 1838 by Koan Ogata (Fig.\u00a01). He was a prominent medical doctor, scholar, and educator in that era, and educated many young people who later contributed to the modernization of Japan. As he emphasized in his revision of Hufeland\u2019s Code for the Physician (Fushi Ikai No Ryaku), altruism and nobility were more highly valued than anything else in Tekijuku. The first of its twelve clauses proceeds as follows [1]: \u201cThe physician lives not for himself but for others. This is the essence of his profession. Do not look for fame or profit. Work to save others though you lose yourself. Maintain life, restore the sick and ease the suffering of men. You have no other object.\u201d \n \n \n \nFig.\u00a01 \n \nA portrait of Koan Ogata and Fushi Ikai Tairyaku 1859 (Ansei 6), by Koan Ogata (also known as Akira Ogata and Kosai Ogata). From the Osaka University Tekijuku Commemoration Association (a collection donated by Mr. Saikichi Ogata) \n \n \n \nHe also used translations of Dutch books to introduce novel Western medical science to Japan, which was considered quite rare in those days, and required his disciples to gain global perspectives in the free-and-open-spirited learning environment of Tekijuku. Today, in the era of globalization, the spirit of Koan has become more and more important, and every one of us must step forward into the world and towards the future. Here, I would also like to introduce a work written by a great Japanese author, Ryotaro Shiba (1923\u20131996), which was intended for young people and entitled Koan no Taimatsu (The Torch of Koan) [2]: \n \n\u201cNothing is more beautiful than a life devoted to the world. Here, I want to write about a person who lived a particularly beautiful life. He is Koan Ogata\u2026 He did not seek fame, nor did he seek personal gain. He had overflowing talent and continued to live for others. That kind of life seems truly beautiful, like distant mountains and rivers. And yet, Koan was not an eccentric person. He was an extremely ordinary person of gentle character as you might find in any village or any town. He was kind to the sick, and his heart was always filled with love\u2026 Koan was a man who took the torch he had received from his mentors and made its flame all the brighter. His greatness was his continuous passing on of his fire to each and every one of his students. The fire of his students\u2019 torches later shined brightly in their respective realms. In the end, their fires became the great light that illuminated Japan\u2019s modern era. We, the generations that followed, must be thankful to Koan.\u201d \n \nOther than Tekijuku in Osaka, we have many historical places in the Kansai region\u2014the fountainhead of Japanese culture. Many old temples and shrines in Kyoto and Nara have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, and attract numerous tourists from all over the world. Another UNESCO World Heritage Site, Himeji Castle, is widely considered Japan\u2019s most spectacular castle; it was never destroyed in wars, earthquakes, or fires, and thus survives in its original form, unlike many other Japanese castles. It is now undergoing substantial once-every-half-century renovation work and will reopen in March 2015, just before the congress. Visitors are sure to be impressed by the breathtaking beauty of this magnificent tower with its silver-white plaster walls and shining black roof tiles. \n \nLastly, again, we truly welcome our many colleagues and hope that every participant in the congress will enjoy not only the congress itself but also the many attractive places to visit in the Kansai region. Surrounded by sea and mountains, Kobe is one of the most beautiful and comfortable cities in Japan. You can enjoy all its charms, exotic streets, delicious cuisine, and amusing nightlife, leading to unforgettable memories. Please join us at JOA 2015 in Kobe: \u201cBe Innovative!\u201d and step forward together \u201cToward the World and Toward the Future!\u201d",

On September 7 and 8, the Institute of Materials and Joining Technology cordially invites you to the Symposium Materials and Joining Technology in Magdeburg. We always strive to bring together scientists and engineers from science and industry. This is also reflected in this year\u2019s symposium, which describes many different topics on various materials, processes and analytical or numerical methods at different size scale. For the first time since the series of symposia has started as a summer school in 1972, we have chosen the IOP conference series: Materials Science and Engineering to give all contributors the opportunity to publish their papers in an international, peer-reviewed journal. Therefore, this volume provides an excellent overview of the main topics of our seminar. We are pleased about the numerous contributions, which unfortunately cannot all be accompanied by an oral presentation during the symposium. Therefore, we would like to explicitly refer to the scientific papers in this volume of the IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, which contains all submitted and accepted papers.

    "abstract": "Along with the release of theWinter issue of Volume 16, EASTS\u2019s editorial transition is about to reach its completion. Wen-Hua Kuo, who has served as editor-in-chief since 2016, will pass the editorship to Professor Wen-ling Tu, who is currently our associate editor. As Professor Kuo\u2019s term was entering its final year in 2021, the search for a new editor was set in motion in spite of the pandemic. Although Professor Tu was soon chosen as the most qualified candidate for the post, the editorial transition took longer than anticipated due to the administrative reorganization of our sponsor, Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), which last July changed its name to the National Science and Technology Council. Professors Tu and Kuo have been working together to discuss the editorial board for 2022\u20132024, and planning with our publishing partner to ensure that the transition goes smoothly and maintains our high editorial standards. Widely recognized for her scholarship in science governance and communication and her devotion to solving science controversies on energy transition and nuclear waste storage, Professor Tu is currently dean of the International College of Innovation and director of the Center for Innovative Democracy at National Chengchi University in Taiwan. She has been engaged in STS in Taiwan since its emergence. Before serving at EASTS, she was editor-in-chief of the Taiwanese Journal for Studies of Science, Technology and Medicine (\u79d1\u6280\u3001\u91ab\u7642\u8207\u793e\u6703), the official journal of the Taiwan STS Association, and convener for the reviewing committee of the Discipline of STS and Science Communication (\u79d1\u6280\u3001\u793e\u6703\u8207\u50b3\u64ad) at MOST. She is also known internationally as the 2018 recipient of the Society for Social Studies of Science\u2019s STS Making and Doing Award (see News and Events, Vol. 12, no. 4), and as an organizer of the Theater of Negotiations at the Taipei Biennial 2020, which was curated by renowned STS scholar Bruno Latour (News and Events, Vol. 15, no. 1). Please join us in welcoming Professor Tu and in looking forward to more exciting issues to come under her stewardship.",

    "title": "Viewing NASA's Mars Budget with Resignation",
    "abstract": "I would like to clarify several points in the News of the Week story (26 September, p. [1754][1]) by A. Lawler, \u201cRising costs could delay NASA's next mission to Mars and future launches.\u201d\n\nWhen the National Research Council's Planetary Science Decadal Survey recommended the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission for priority funding, it assigned a cost level of $650 million. This value, rather than $1.4 billion, is the true metric for seeing the deep damage that MSL's profligately overrunning cost\u2014now likely to top $2.1 billion\u2014has inflicted on NASA's Mars and wider planetary science budget.\n\nAlso, the story focused its overrun discussion on instrument costs. Although certainly part of the problem, instrument cost increases have been considerably smaller than overruns in the rest of MSL's budget, which was severely mismatched to the project's complexity from its inception. This mismatch sowed the most fundamental seeds of MSL's cost problems.\n\nThe article's end quote described NASA's Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission plan as \u201csmoke and mirrors.\u201d Disappointingly, MSR is becoming a mirage in the wake of MSL and other budget damage caused by numerous substantial Science Mission Directorate (SMD) cost overruns accepted in recent months. However, as evidenced by both internal NASA and external Office of Management and Budget scrutiny in 2007, NASA's MSR plan in the President's Fiscal Year 2009 budget did fit in SMD's future budget envelope. It could well have launched near 2020, had a strong emphasis on cost control been sustained as a priority.\n\nFinally, there was no mention that a NASA independent review team found numerous development issues that called MSL's 2009 launch date into serious doubt almost a year ago. Nor did it describe that scenarios for dealing with MSL without causing such deep budgetary damage elsewhere were proposed by SMD but rejected at higher levels in early 2008. That, and the concurrent, forced disbanding of the MSL independent review team, precipitated my resignation as SMD Associate Administrator.\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.321.5897.1754",

    "title": "Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance - United States, 2015.",
    "abstract": "PROBLEM\nPriority health-risk behaviors contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults. Population-based data on these behaviors at the national, state, and local levels can help monitor the effectiveness of public health interventions designed to protect and promote the health of youth nationwide.\n\n\nREPORTING PERIOD COVERED\nSeptember 2014-December 2015.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM\nThe Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other priority health behaviors. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results for 118 health behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2015 national survey, 37 state surveys, and 19 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9-12.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults from the 2015 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10-24 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 41.5% of high school students nationwide among the 61.3% who drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey had texted or e-mailed while driving, 32.8% had drunk alcohol, and 21.7% had used marijuana. During the 12 months before the survey, 15.5% had been electronically bullied, 20.2% had been bullied on school property, and 8.6% had attempted suicide. Many high school students are engaged in sexual risk behaviors that relate to unintended pregnancies and STIs, including HIV infection. Nationwide, 41.2% of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 30.1% had had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 11.5% had had sexual intercourse with four or more persons during their life. Among currently sexually active students, 56.9% had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results from the 2015 national YRBS also indicated many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. During the 30 days before the survey, 10.8% of high school students had smoked cigarettes and 7.3% had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 5.2% of high school students had not eaten fruit or drunk 100% fruit juices and 6.7% had not eaten vegetables. More than one third (41.7%) had played video or computer games or used a computer for something that was not school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day and 14.3% had not participated in at least 60 minutes of any kind of physical activity that increased their heart rate and made them breathe hard on at least 1 day during the 7 days before the survey. Further, 13.9% had obesity and 16.0% were overweight.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nMany high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of most health behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and across states and large urban school districts. Long-term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most health-risk behaviors has decreased (e.g., riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, physical fighting, current cigarette use, current alcohol use, and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other behaviors and health outcomes has not changed (e.g., suicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, smokeless tobacco use, having ever used marijuana, and attending physical education classes) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because of safety concerns, obesity, overweight, not eating vegetables, and not drinking milk). Monitoring emerging risk behaviors (e.g., texting and driving, bullying, and electronic vapor product use) is important to understand how they might vary over time.\n\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTION\nYRBSS data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health behaviors among subpopulations of students; assess trends in health behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 21 national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; and help develop and evaluate school and community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and improve health outcomes among youth.",

    "title": "Virtual Reality Aided Therapy towards Health 4.0: A Two-Decade Bibliometric Analysis",
    "abstract": "Health 4.0 aligns with Industry 4.0 and encourages the application of the latest technologies to healthcare. Virtual reality (VR) is a potentially significant component of the Health 4.0 vision. Though VR in health care is a popular topic, there is little knowledge of VR-aided therapy from a macro perspective. Therefore, this paper was aimed to explore the research of VR in aiding therapy, thus providing a potential guideline for futures application of therapeutic VR in healthcare towards Health 4.0. A mixed research method was adopted for this research, which comprised the use of a bibliometric analysis (a quantitative method) to conduct a macro overview of VR-aided therapy, the identification of significant research structures and topics, and a qualitative review of the literature to reveal deeper insights. Four major research areas of VR-aided therapy were identified and investigated, i.e., post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and fear related disorder (A&F), diseases of the nervous system (DNS), and pain management, including related medical conditions, therapies, methods, and outcomes. This study is the first to use VOSviewer, a commonly used software tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks and developed by Center for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, the Netherlands, to conduct bibliometric analyses on VR-aided therapy from the perspective of Web of Science core collection (WoSc), which objectively and visually shows research structures and topics, therefore offering instructive insights for health care stakeholders (particularly researchers and service providers) such as including integrating more innovative therapies, emphasizing psychological benefits, using game elements, and introducing design research. The results of this paper facilitate with achieving the vision of Health 4.0 and illustrating a two-decade (2000 to year 2020) map of pre-life of the Health Metaverse.",

    "abstract": "The surgical case was straightforward: a young man had experienced a radial nerve injury from a broken humerus, now without neurological recovery. Tendon transfers to restore wrist and finger extension were planned. The surgeon, resident, and medical student approached the scrub sink together to review major teaching points, potential pitfalls, and contingency plans in case of complications. As the surgeon reached for a scrub brush, the medical student lingered back, his thumbs incessantly and rhythmically tapping on the screen of his phone. The surgeon peered at him with frustration, annoyed that again his student appeared more interested in his smartphone than the pathology. In an effort to engage him back to the case, the surgeon asked: \u201cCan you tell me what tendons lie in each of the extensor compartments in the hand?\u201d The student\u2019s head snapped up, and he quickly rattled off the answer with ease. Smiling momentarily, he then asked, \u201cCould I get your thoughts on this new video describing nerve transfers rather than tendon transfers for radial nerve injuries that was just uploaded to our educational portal? See, I have it pulled up right here, it was just presented last week at the plenary session...\u201d Generational diversity describes the shared perspectives and experiences among individuals born within boundaries of time, such as the silent generation (19251945), the baby boomers (1946-1964), and Generation X (1965-1980).1 Individuals entering medicine today were born between 1980 and 2000, termed millennials. Millennials comprise about 25% of today\u2019s workforce and will account for 40% and 75% of the workforce in 2020 and 2025, respectively. We recognize that these assertions do not apply to every member of a particular generation. Nevertheless, the values, expectations, and ethos that define millennials are perceived as substantially different from their predecessors and have caught the attention, and concern, of older generations. This is particularly true in medicine where training, advancement, and mentorship are steeped in tradition and where change often comes slowly. Millennials have been shaped by a profound expansion of information technology, enhanced social networking, and a connected global culture. Although sometimes labeled as impatient, distracted, overly socialized, and entitled, millennials could also be characterized as deeply empowered, collaborative, and innovative. These generalizations, however, can lead to conflict and misunderstanding, particularly in environments such as hospitals where apprenticeship and hierarchy are the norm. Mentorship is the cornerstone of academic medicine. A mentor is defined as an advisor characterized by altruism, expertise, patience, and experience. In many ways, graduate medical education has adapted to millennials through the expansion of online and videobased learning resources, disease-based educational curricula, abbreviated work hours, and team-based care models.2 However, mentorship strategies for millennial faculty members, residents, and medical students are not well understood. Indeed, we have personally witnessed generational differences leading to frustration, miscommunication, and attrition in these mentormentee dyads. Consider 3 common scenarios. Example 1. Susan is a junior faculty member drafting her career development award with her division chief, Mary, as primary mentor. Their offices are in close proximity; Susan often drops in throughout the day between Mary\u2019s meetings to ask questions on the wording. Mary finds this irritating, as it circumvents the usual scheduling channels. Susan is annoyed that Mary seems to have little time for her. Theme 1. As Needed vs Scheduled Engagement. Millennials have grown up with virtually instant communication and information dissemination. Such engagement facilitates quick decision making and expands collaboration networks. Millennials expect accessibility, fast responses, rapid turnaround, and frequent short meetings to ensure clear direction. Senior mentors often balance administrative, clinical, and academic demands with greater structure and less ad hoc availability. Combined, this leads to frustration and stress for both parties. Example 2. John is a third-year medical student conducting a summer project examining the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques on cardiovascular risk in patients following myocardial infarction. He has a question about the survey data collection and sends a group email to Sam, a junior faculty member directly supervising the project, and to Mark, the chairman of the department who will serve as a senior author on the project. Mark is annoyed that Sam isn\u2019t taking care of the question; Sam is embarrassed that John emailed the chair directly, and John is frustrated that no one appears to be answering his question. Theme 2. Flat vs Pyramidal Infrastructure. Millennials embrace collaboration and cognitive diversity more readily than prior generations.3 In some aspects of academic medicine, these attributes will serve them well. For example, team science, multidisciplinary care, and collective leadership are welcomed by millennials who embrace groupthink, in contrast to their senior counterparts. However, flattening social and hierarchical gaps may also lead to conflict. Millennials do not necessarily embrace the siloed communication typical of traditional academic departments. Removing these barriers can cause frustration among older physicians accustomed to hierarchical communication channels and younger physicians who desire broad access to all stakeholders. Example 3. Scott, a junior attending, has developed an intervention to improve the safety of common percuA PIECE OF MY MIND",

    "title": "Synchronous Online Learning through Microsoft Teams at Tertiary Level: Academic English Course",
    "abstract": "As for a recent learning platform as synchronous online learning through Microsoft Teams (MS Teams) in Academic English course based on particular three learning domains, very few previous studies were conducted and explored in Thailand and Asia. Due to the unending epidemic of COVID-19, the pedagogy in EFL context at every level of educational institutes has to be shifted to an online approach that has never been implemented in Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna Tak (RMUTL Tak), Thailand. The current study has mainly addressed the research gap by determining underlying cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects in synchronous online learning. Therefore, this paper aimed to investigate perceptions and difficulties of synchronous learning in Academic English course through MS Teams. Academic English skills are not only acquired during the early years of Thai educational system but also at tertiary level. RMUTL Tak has currently provided an Academic English course as a mandatory subject that every undergraduate student has to pass this course before graduation. Promoting synchronous learning to Academic English course allows students have greater learning motivation. In the study, two hundred and fifty four undergraduate students studied in three faculties comprising Business Administration and Liberal Arts, Engineering, and Sciences and Agricultural Technology at RMUTL Tak. They were all enrolling in an Academic English course in the first semester, academic year 2020. Additionally, an online questionnaire including twenty one items and one open-ended question was employed in the study. All obtained data was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings revealed that most of the participants have positively perceived synchronous learning as their fruitful online platform. Nonetheless, it was found that poor internet signal was considered as a dominant factor preventing them from learning online.\n\u00a0\nReceived: 8 March 2021 / Accepted: 2 August 2021 / Published: 5 September 2021",

    "title": "Epidemiology of injuries: current trends and future challenges.",
    "abstract": "For the above challenges to be met, it will be important for the field of injury epidemiology to move from the largely descriptive studies that have predominated in the literature to the application of more rigorous analytical methods for defining the underlying casual patterns of injury. Studies focusing on the descriptive epidemiology of injury have and will continue to serve the field well, perhaps even more so than in other fields, since the proximal etiology of injuries (i.e., acute exposure to physical agents such as mechanical energy) is well known. However, major new advances in the prevention of injuries will continue to require a more analytical approach to understanding the complex array of factors that influence the incidence, severity, and outcomes of injury. At the same time, it will be important for investigators in this field to conduct rigorous evaluations of new interventions to better inform the establishment of programs and policies. These evaluations must include assessments of both the effectiveness and the costs of the intervention. For example, in a recently published systematic review of 10 different strategies for preventing motor vehicle injuries, 54,708 papers and reports were identified in the literature but only 161 met the initial screening criteria for inclusion in the published review (44). Of these, a much smaller number were randomized controlled trials or well executed controlled time series trials. Major advancements in the prevention and control of injuries will continue to rely on effective collaborations between epidemiologists and scientists from other disciplines, including the behavioral sciences, sociology, criminology, law, engineering, and biomechanics. Only through truly collaborative efforts across these disciplines will we be able to establish a foundation for cost-effective interventions. For example, understanding the principles of injury mechanics and the physical and physiologic responses of the human body to the impact of injury is fundamental to the study of injury causation (6). While significant advances have been made in this regard, more work needs to be done. The biomechanics of head injury are still not well understood, yet head injuries account for nearly 50 percent of all injury deaths and remain the leading cause of both injury death and disability among children and young adults. Animal and human cadaver research combined with rapidly evolving techniques of computerized modeling will continue to play a critical role in increasing our understanding of injury mechanisms. At the same time, the development of effective interventions is dependent on a better understanding of the role of behavior in injury causation and prevention (45). We know, for example, that the use of personal protective devices such as seat belts, car seats, and bicycle helmets reduces injury risk and that these behaviors can be influenced through educational, behavioral, and legislative strategies (46-49). Interventions addressing individuals at risk can be enhanced by additional research into risk perception, risk-taking, and behavioral responses to safety improvements. However, behavioral strategies may also be used effectively with key decision-makers who design and manufacture products and who pass and implement laws that affect the injury risk of entire populations; more research is needed to understand and influence the process of behavior change in these groups (50). The importance of injury as a major public health problem worldwide was highlighted in the seminal report \"The Global Burden of Disease\" (25). Worldwide, injuries account for approximately one in eight deaths among males and one in 14 deaths among females (51). Motor vehicle injuries alone constitute the ninth leading cause of disease burden as measured by the number of associated disability-adjusted life years (25). By the year 2020, motor vehicle injuries are projected to increase in rank to third. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",
