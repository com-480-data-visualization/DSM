86bdf62b4a8fdfd58fc9a951a92df457f21d2b75,"Spawning Four-Year, ABET-AccreditablePrograms in Cybersecurity from Existing Computer Science Programs in Thailand","Purpose–Thailand faces many cybersecurity challenges. In the first few months of 2022 alone, there were over 300,000 cyber-attacks in the country, and annually the problem has gotten significantly worse. It is estimated that Thailand loses 286 billion US dollars per annum due to cybercrimes. These attacks include credit card fraud, phishing, ransomware, scamming, infor-mation, and identity theft, business email compromises, child pornography, intellectual prop-erty infringements, cyberstalking and harassment, denial of service, botnets, fake news, and stolen funds. To defend against cyber criminals, well-trained professionals in cybersecurity are needed.By 2025, there is an expected shortfall of over four million cybersecurity workers globally. We examine what it would take to spawn an accreditable four-year curriculum in cy-bersecurity from a typical Thai Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. At present, there are few university programs in Thailand dedicated to cybersecurity. We hope this work inspires educational institutions to develop quality four-year degrees in cybersecurity, with the goals of meeting workforce demands, reducing cybercrime, and promoting Thailand as a viable and healthy place to conduct e-business.

Method–The paper employs expert analysis to forge an accreditable program in cybersecu-rity from a computer science program.Results–The authors describe an ABET-accreditable program in cybersecurityand show how to develop it in a step-by-step manner.

Conclusion–An ABET-accreditable program in cybersecurity can be spawned from a computer science program with relatively few additional courses and modifications while placing more emphasis on ABET's crosscutting concepts.

Recommendations–Institutions that are interested in developing four-year cybersecurity pro-grams can begin crafting them in the manner described in this work. 

Research Implications–Cybersecurity professionals can be developed.

Practical Implications–New quality cybersecurity programs can be developed promptly.

Social Implications–There will be more qualified professionals to help fight cybercriminals.

f582076f3aab89cfdee51cbedacddd7767a9bcd2,AI Generated Code Plagiarism Detection in Computer Science Courses: A Literature Mapping,"This is a full research paper. Integrity in the detection of plagiarism in students' source codes in university programming courses is a research topic for instructors and institutions seeking to improve the quality of their teaching. In particular, introductory courses such as CS1, are of paramount importance, as this is when students gain fundamental knowledge to build their future on. With the latest developments in Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc., methods of plagiarism have evolved, however methods of detection may not be capable of accurately differentiating between code generated by human and artificial intelligence (AI). In this context, this paper seeks to answer the research question: What does the current literature report on AI generated code plagiarism detection in higher education? To expand on and formulate a comprehensive answer to our research question (RQ), we have formulated six sub-questions: RQ1) How many papers were published per year by country?; RQ2) Which conferences and journals have published most papers on this subject?; RQ3) Which plagiarism detection tools were most often used prior to common AI use?; RQ4) How are educators adapting assignments to minimize the use of AI?; RQ5) Which modern methods are being deployed to specifically detect AI?; RQ6) Which data sources and languages are most prevalent in the literature? The methodology was based on a systematic literature review. Initially, we confined our search for literature to Scopus and Web of Science, however additional literature was included from Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria were applied to include documents from the years 2023 and 2024 (after the launch of ChatGPT), and only published by conferences and journals. Exclusion criteria: papers that do not focus on plagiarism and programming courses; papers that are not about the undergraduate-level; papers not written in English. We found 165 papers via Scopus and WebScience, from which the metadata were collected, resulting in 17 relevant papers selected for this work. The second step was a search in Google Scholar, where we analyzed 200 documents from 2023 (100 relevant documents) and 2024 (100 relevant documents). We used the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, however, we included the ArXiv papers, and found 9 more papers. Following this process, we have identified 26 papers to include in this literary mapping. In this paper we present the answers to these research questions and discussions about this research topic.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893117?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893117, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Chubaryan. It was followed by other textbooks in this discipline. Reconstructing their history and evolutionary transformations is important to reflect and evaluate the progressive development and achievements of Soviet and post-Soviet library science. This is a unique pedagogical experience of forming professional knowledge and self-awareness of several generations of future library specialists, many of whom became veterans of librarianship and contributed to its progress. In Soviet times four textbooks on library science were published, approved by the Ministry of Culture of the USSR for use in higher education institutions of the country — three editions of the textbook by O.S. Chubaryan (1960, 1968, 1976) and one collective work — “Library Science. General Course”, prepared by Moscow and Leningrad scientists under the editorship of K.I. Abramov and N.S. Kartashov (1988). The post-Soviet textbook “General Library Science” by V.V. Skvortsov and N.S. Kartashov (1996—1997) was published in two parts. The transition to the Bologna system of education in Russia and the activation of higher education served as a catalyst for the project of publishing textbooks for bachelors of library and information science, the first of which — “Library Science. General Course” under the scientific editorship of A.N. Vaneyev and M.N. Kolesnikova (2013). Later, the textbook of the Moscow State Institute of Culture was published under the editorship of M.Y. Dvorkina and L.I. Salnikova (2015). At the current stage of modernization of the country’s higher education system and withdrawal from the Bologna system of education, the updating of the entire series of textbooks began. The textbook “Library Science. General Course” edited by M.N. Kolesnikova (2024) is prepared on a different conceptual basis than the previous post-Soviet textbooks.

Based on a comparative analysis, the article draws conclusions about the problems faced by both domestic and foreign specialists in the field of education. The article analyzes the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and problems of the school and university education systems in Russia and abroad, and considers their relationship. It is substantiated that the lack of consistency and discreteness in the process of teaching computer science and information technology at school lead to a discrepancy between the training of school graduates and the requirements for the basic knowledge of first-year university students. The article presents the results of the analysis of basic curricula at school (in the field of computer science) and curricula in the preparation of future computer science teachers at the university (using the Transbaikal State University as an example). The authors analyze the results of diagnostic testing, which was conducted with first-year students of the Transbaikal State University in September 2023/2024, in order to monitor their existing knowledge and skills in the field of computer science. The article suggests ways to solve the problem of secondary school – higher education institution continuity in the field of computer science. The results of the study can be used in the preparation of future computer science teachers in higher educational institutions.

Our goals for this BOF are to build and strengthen relationships with other chapter leaders and members, share best practices from our chapters, and scope possible areas of cooperation. We'll document our shared learnings and write up a report to be sent to all regional chapters and the CSTA leadership, with the possibility of presenting our findings at the 2024 CSTA Chapter Leadership Summit to support other regions in developing similar models of regional cooperation. After a brief introduction, we'll engage in a jigsaw/networking activity, designed to get participants to know others from different CSTA chapters and to share expertise and experiences across these communities. We'll then have a structured, group discussion regarding the value and feasibility of a regional conference within the context of the goals and activities of local chapters and the national organization. We intend to include on line attendees in order to support K-12 teachers who are unable to attend conferences during a school year in person. CSTA is an organization run by teachers, for teachers.

Thus, this quantitative research aimed to determine the mediating role of science motivation on the relationship between computer literacy and the academic performance of Grade 6 learners during the academic year 2023-2024. Modified and adapted survey questionnaires from the Department of Education Computerization Program (DCP), Cagayan State University – Andrews Campus, and Glynn (2011), using a 5-point Likert scale, were employed for data collection. Analysis involved mean, two-way ANOVA, and path analysis. Results showed that the Grade 6 learners exhibited a high level of computer literacy in terms of computer integration (mean=3.78). The academic performance of Grade 6 learners indicated a very high level in terms of student-related factors (mean=4.3). Concurrently, Grade six learners are often more extrinsically motivated (mean=4.09). Significant indirect relationship was shown between computer literacy and academic performance through science motivation. Significant direct relationship was also shown between computer literacy and academic performance. The total effect estimates of 0.531 (SE = 0.0804, Z = 6.61, p < 0.001) suggests that there is a significant overall relationship between computer literacy and academic performance, regardless of the mediating effect of science motivation.

a4dbcad6a924fa289b0099b8bb727cbecf66c1a3,"IN THE THIRD YEAR OF WAR: SIGNS OF GENOCIDE OF THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE THROUGH THE DESTRUCTION OF MEDICINE, SCIENCE, AND EDUCATION","The war in Ukraine has serious consequences for the entire Ukrainian society and the world in general. The Ukrainian people have once again suffered a tragic event at the hands of the Russian Federation in the 21st century, resulting in a bloody genocide and undermining the concept of freedom for all humanity. Ukraine survived the Holodomor genocides of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the occupation wars of the Soviet Union in the early 1920s and late 1930s, and deportations of Ukrainians in the 20th and 21st centuries [1]. 
Every family remembers the significant losses of loved ones through generations and their suffering across the world. The concept of genocide as a crime emerged in international law after the Second World War. Lawyer Raphael Lemkin, a Polish and American legal practitioner of Jewish origin, first introduced the term genocide as a legal concept. In the early 1920s, R. Lemkin studied philology and then law at the Jan Kazimierz University of Lviv. He defended his doctoral thesis at Heidelberg University in Germany, served as an assistant prosecutor in Berezhany in Ternopil Region, and lectured in Warsaw. In the early 1930s, he represented Poland at international legal conferences, and as early as 1933, he suggested that those who deliberately harmed a large group of people out of hatred and destroyed their cultural treasures, engaged in “vandalism,” killed, and raped should be considered as manifestations of genocide. People who performed actions or gave orders to do them should be tried and punished [2]. On December 9, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The definition of genocide is used in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court [3]. The following acts committed with the intention of complete or partial destruction of the national, ethnic, racial or religious group are considered genocide: 1) murder; 2) causing severe physical or mental injuries; 3) deliberate creation of living conditions that are designed for complete or partial destruction; 4) actions intended to prevent the birth of children; 5) forcible transfer of children of this group to another group [4]. 
Thousands of Ukrainian civilians, wounded, soldiers, and prisoners of war have been victims of violent murders in this war. Russian prisoners of war have given testimony: “We had an order to immediately shoot anyone over 15 years of age without a word. 20 to 24 individuals were executed, including teenagers aged 10–15 and 17... we cleared the building. It was unimportant who was there... In Soledar and Bakhmut, 150 Wagner Group mercenaries killed everyone – women, men, retired, and children, including young ones aged five... If they disobeyed orders, they were killed” [5]. They not only murdered civilian Ukrainians but were also ordered to finish off injured Ukrainian soldiers and shoot and behead prisoners[5]. 
In Geneva, Chair of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry, Erik Møse, stated that while no evidence had yet been found, the question «of the genocide in Ukraine presented by independent experts regarding the actions of the Russian aggressor (killings, inflicting severe bodily or mental injuries) needed further investigation». This is how the UN works, not for the people, but for the Russian Federation!!! [6] 
The International Criminal Court in the Hague, which has the authority to prosecute individuals responsible for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, has only recognized the fifth item as a manifestation of genocide in Ukraine – the forcible transfer of children from one group to another. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, for deporting Ukrainian children to Russia, as well as for the RF Commissioner for Children’s Rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, who is suspected of committing a war crime. The courageous and consistent chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, believes that no one should feel free to commit crimes [7]. 
We review the third and fourth items of the UN Convention in this article, which demonstrate signs of genocide in Ukraine and are associated with medicine, education, and science. Specifically, the intentional creation of living conditions intended for complete or partial destruction, actions intended to prevent the birth of children. 
Since late February 2022 and up to the present day, the WHO has verified 1,773 attacks on the healthcare system in Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of at least 136 medical workers and injuries to 288 [8]. 1,564 medical facilities were damaged, and an additional 208 were completely destroyed. During this period, the Russian army also destroyed 260 ambulances, damaged 161, and captured another 125. The enemy attacks medical infrastructure, such as hospitals, outpatient healthcare facilities, maternity hospitals, polyclinics, etc., on a daily basis [9]. In 2024, the attacks intensified. The healthcare infrastructure has suffered significant damage, particularly in areas near the front line. Up to 14% of facilities were completely destroyed, and up to 48% experienced partial damage. During this period, 40% of all attacks on the healthcare system are targeted at the primary level of medical care, hindering Ukrainians’ access to essential medical services. Emergency medical care centers accounted for 15% of the attacks. The number of double strikes has increased, posing an even greater danger to emergency workers and civilians. Emergency service workers and medical transport personnel are three times more likely to be injured by such strikes compared to other medical professionals. The most significant damage was suffered by medical facilities in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Mykolaiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts. 
The cost of medications has increased for the state during the war, particularly when inpatient treatment for patients is required. Patients purchase many medications themselves. Delivery of medicines to frontline regions is challenging. Providing access to medications is a significant issue in the healthcare sector, especially in areas that are subjected to constant shelling. As of April 2023, 75% of individuals had faced challenges because of the rising cost of medications, and 44% had difficulties obtaining them[10]. 
From February 24, 2022 to September 2023, complicated patients with oncological, autoimmune, and cardiovascular conditions who were receiving medication through clinical trials were affected. According to data from the State Expert Center of Ukraine, at the onset of the full-scale war, international sponsors of clinical trials suspended patient recruitment for 217 clinical trials. 234 clinical trials were prematurely terminated. Participants in the clinical trials were given four options: continuing treatment at the trial site (if possible), withdrawing from the trial early, transferring to other sites within Ukraine, or transferring to locations outside of Ukraine. Displaced patients scattered across over 25 countries around the world. The top therapeutic fields of transferred researched individuals were oncology, neurology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, and cardiology [10].   
Damaging the energy infrastructure in Ukraine directly impacts the functioning of healthcare facilities. This applies to both the supply of electricity and water. Following the strikes on energy infrastructure last month, the winter season of 2024–2025 is likely to be extremely challenging. We also need to consider the availability of quality water and adequate sanitation, which are essential conditions for ensuring public health. 22% of households in the frontline regions delay seeking medical assistance. This is mainly due to financial constraints. Specifically, 24% of households are unable to afford medication, while 51% cannot cover the cost of medical services or vaccinations. Furthermore, there is an increasing lack of medical staff and a significant level of burnout. They feel a double burden. Medical professionals are part of affected communities in need of support and psychological assistance [11,12]. 
Therefore, the deliberate killing of patients and medical staff, the destruction of hospitals, polyclinics, outpatient medical facilities, and maternity hospitals, the destruction of the energy supply of medical facilities, the double bombing of ambulances, the inability to obtain necessary medications for patients, especially the seriously ill, the lack of possibility of getting medical assistance for Ukrainian citizens on their own territory are all consequences of the treacherous war waged by the Russian Federation against a neighboring country with the aim of seizing Ukrainian lands. Isn’t it a manifestation of genocide? Citizens of Ukraine have been deprived of the right to normal medical care for a third consecutive year! As medical professionals, we would like to ask the UN Investigative Committee if this could be considered a form of genocide. 
Children and young people have faced terrible trials as a result of the brutal war, depriving them of a normal life and education. 1,790 children have been recognized as victims during the deceitful war in Ukraine. 535 children have died, and over 1,255 have sustained injuries of varying degrees of severity, according to official information from juvenile prosecutors [13]. Many children and students had their schools, colleges, institutes, and universities destroyed or captured. 410 educational institutions were completely destroyed, and over 3,500 were damaged [14]. 
Due to frequent air raid alerts and bombings in Ukraine, education takes place in shelters or remotely. Children and youth lack the chance to obtain a quality education, making it challenging for them to enroll in higher educational institutions. More than a million children are unable to communica",Proceeding of the Shevchenko Scientific Society.

However, few studies have used a longitudinal design to examine changes in gender stereotypes across a range of STEM fields. In a large, preregistered study, we examined the developmental trajectories of two gender stereotypes (involving interest and ability) in four STEM fields across three time points within a calendar year, starting in Grades 2-8. The diverse sample included 803 students ages 7-15 years old at the start of the study (50% girls; 8.5% Asian, 6.0% Black, 25.5% Hispanic/Latinx, 43.7% White, and 16.3% other). Multilevel growth modeling was used to examine developmental trajectories in students' stereotypes for four STEM fields (math, science, computer science, and engineering) while considering both gender and grade level. We found that different STEM disciplines displayed different developmental patterns: Math ability and science interest stereotypes more strongly favored girls over the year among elementary school participants, whereas computer science stereotypes less strongly favored boys over time, and engineering stereotypes (which largely favored boys) were stable across time. The results highlight that the development of stereotypes is not the same for all STEM fields as well as the need to understand the complexity and specificity of developmental change across fields and types of stereotypes.

Due to the volume of content delivered across multiple courses, student cognitive abilities can be affected, leading to lower student performance. In physiology and related biological sciences, educators have turned to delivering content using virtual teaching technologies, including virtual and augmented reality, simulations, and other immersive platforms. At the University of South Australia, Articulate Storyline, Unity-based simulations, and immersive software platforms have been implemented across the entire Laboratory Medicine program to assist students in learning lecture and laboratory content. The impact of these individual interventions is outlined in this manuscript. In addition, the final year 2024 cohort is the first group who have used simulations throughout their degree. Evidence of the benefits and impact of the scaffolded implementation of simulations and immersive software was obtained through a Likert-style questionnaire. The deployment of simulations and immersive software across the degree has significantly enhanced student learning, and engagement with the content effectively bridging the gap between understanding lecture and laboratory content of students in the Laboratory Medicine program. We suggest that a similar approach could readily be embedded within individual courses as well as across science programs to provide the same benefits to student learning.",Advances in Physiology Education,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1152/advan.00128.2024?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00128.2024, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Bergin, a leading pioneer in psychotherapy outcome research and cofounder of the Society of Psychotherapy Research, who died at home in St. George, Utah, on February 15, 2024. Bergin began his university education at Massachusetts Institute of Technology but soon became disenchanted with ""tech."" He transferred to Reed College in Portland, Oregon, and later to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where he received BA (1956) and MA (1957) degrees in psychology. For his PhD in clinical psychology, Allen studied at Stanford under his beloved mentor Albert Bandura. He took his first academic position at Columbia University at the age of 26. In 1955 at Brigham Young University, he became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon), which motivated and informed much of his research and advocacy for integrating spirituality into the mental health professions. Allen earned many awards, including the American Psychological Association's Award for Distinguished Professional Contributions to Knowledge.

The study aims to examine 1. The level of task complexity for the students in science; 2. The level of students’ cognitive load in science; 3. The relationship between task complexity and students’ cognitive load in science. The participant of the study involves 87 science students from 3 different sections of grade-11 selected through purposive sampling. Participants answered a 42-item survey questionnaire divided into two parts focusing on the task complexity and cognitive load. The data collected were analyzed using statistical tool called SPSS. Analysis of the data shows several insights on the cause and effect of task complexity and cognitive load as well as the close direct proportionality of the variables. While complex task triggers the students to do more and improve their output better, there is still a need to improve in delivering and presentation of the task and lesson. A well-structured task that aligns with students' cognitive capabilities and reduce extraneous cognitive load can significantly enhance learning outcomes. By balancing task complexity with appropriate support, educators can foster deeper understanding and more effective learning experiences. Educators should continue refining task design to ensure it supports cognitive load management while promoting engagement. Further research is needed to explore how specific task structures impact different types of cognitive load across various learning environments. Additionally, developing targeted strategies to reduce extraneous load in digital learning contexts could provide valuable insights for improving online education.",International Journal of Latest Technology in Engineering Management &amp; Applied Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.ijltemas.in/submission/index.php/online/article/download/1118/455', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.51583/ijltemas.2024.1311012?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.51583/ijltemas.2024.1311012, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

He died unexpectedly on March 1, 2024, in Durham, North Carolina, while recovering from knee surgeries. In a life of considerable accomplishments, the readers of this journal will note his 13-year leadership as executive vice president and chief executive officer of the American Psychological Association (APA). From 2003 to 2016, Norman led the APA to its ascendant status among behavioral health professional associations. Norman's approach was to lead with a calm, mindful, humble, and graceful demeanor, which made everyone feel seen and heard. Norman began his career in 1985 as an assistant professor at the Duke School of Medicine and was among the first behavioral scientists to study and write about the role of psychosocial stress in the development of hypertension in African Americans. From 1995 to 2000, Norman served as the founding director of the National Institutes of Health Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research. After the National Institutes of Health, Norman briefly served on the faculty of the Harvard School of Public Health. He cultivated a profound interior life but was also engaged as a competitive amateur athlete and actively promoted the social activism exemplified by his heroes-Martin Luther King, Jr., Howard Thurman, and others committed to social justice. Norman sought to integrate the active and contemplative dimensions of human experience. He will be deeply missed.

12adecd8105076f2e5b2af16cf7f6b02297405d3,"PACMHCI V8, CHI PLAY, October 2024 Editorial","We are excited to present PACM HCI's 2024 issue on games and play research, which contains 63 original and highly relevant articles covering the entire spectrum of HCI games research. As in the previous year, we used three recommendations ' 'Accept with Minor Revisions', 'Revise and Resubmit', and 'Reject.' For papers that were accepted with minor revisions, the second round of reviews was a 'light-touch' process in which the editorial board members checked the revisions, whereas papers that received Revise and Resubmit received another full round of external reviews with the same reviewers in most cases, and were also subjected to a final selection process. This second revision was treated as a real resubmission, which meant that it was given full consideration, but no guarantee or preferential treatment towards acceptance; a share of the revised papers was ultimately rejected. We would like to acknowledge the efforts that our community has made in adapting to this new process, working together with the submitting authors to achieve high-quality scholarship. The track editorial board consisted of 32 members and a total of 230 external reviewers from around the world ensured a high-quality review process. After the first round of submissions, each paper was handled by a primary track editorial board member who received reviews from a second track editorial board member and two external reviewers so that each submission received at least three high-quality reviews. After reviews were completed and checked for quality, the primary initiated discussion amongst the reviewers and came up with a preliminary recommendation (accept, between accept and revise and resubmit, revise and resubmit, between revise and resubmit and reject, reject). Papers that were in the middle three categories were then discussed in two synchronous virtual track editorial board meetings that took place over two consecutive days. The inclusion of the board meeting at this stage was a new addition to the review process last year. We included it to better calibrate decision making across the committee at this critical point in the review process, ensure consistency in outcomes, promote reflection and consideration at this stage in the process, and mentor newer editorial board members in the review process. We strove for a diverse program approaching games research from a variety of perspectives, including design, engineering, psychology, computer and data science while at the same time only accepting high-quality pieces of work. In this issue, we observe the following distribution of primary contributions: 42.9% of papers self-classify as using qualitative methods, 11.1% use quantitative methods, and 20.6% use mixed methods. Additionally, 3.2% of papers present design artifacts and 6.3% present technical artifacts. Finally, 4.8% of papers employ meta-research methods, 6.3% of papers present a new methodological approach, and 4.8% of papers contribute to the development and validation of theory. All articles in this issue were invited to present at the ACM CHI PLAY 2024 conference. We thank our dedicated team of track editorial board members, external reviewers, and paper authors, who continue to support the new review process and timeline, contributing to the maturation and growth of the PACM HCI games and play research community, and resulting in this issue of 63 exciting and highly relevant articles. This issue's 63 papers reflect the importance of play in our everyday lives, comment on recent trends and technical developments relevant to games and play, and also represent a significant effort of our community in coming together to produce a collection of research that highlights the multifaceted value of play.",Proc.

edfecf33b337e3c180ca2c878f6d4736da22e134,188 Undergraduate outreach to foster student interest in clinical and translational science career pathways: Creation of a certificate and CTS Roadshow programming,"Objectives/Goals: Academic research centers struggle to recruit and retain a diverse, competent clinical and translational science (CTS) workforce. The clinical research professional career pathway is particularly underrecognized among undergraduates, despite offering multiple career opportunities. Methods/Study Population: To address these challenges, two undergraduate outreach programs were developed. First, an undergraduate certificate program in CTS (UC-CTS) was designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to enter the workforce immediately after graduation. Second, a “CTS Roadshow” was launched to build awareness of CTS careers within a variety of undergraduate programs and majors. In this recruitment initiative, principal investigators (PIs) and CRPs visit classrooms to share information about CTS career pathways and offer insights into the roles, responsibilities, and professional opportunities available in the field. Results/Anticipated Results: The UC-CTS program launched in Fall 2024 as a 12-credit certificate that includes two paid internships: one in patient care and one in research. Currently, the program has 5 students enrolled with an anticipated increase in enrollment to 20 students by Spring 2025. Similarly, the CTS Roadshow has reached an increasing number of students each year. Since its inception in Spring 2023, the CTS Roadshow has introduced over 750 undergraduates across 21 courses to CTS careers. The CTS Roadshow has engaged students from a variety of majors, including biology, psychology, medical sciences, legal, finance, accounting, and pre-health programs, increasing awareness of and interest in CTS careers. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Both programs aim to expose students to CTS careers early in their education, better preparing them for full-time CTS roles after graduation. A rise in qualified applicants pursuing CTS careers locally and regionally is expected, improving job satisfaction and retention through enhanced preparation for the career field.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.843', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/cts.2024.843?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.843, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods: Two reviewers conducted a systematic search across PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria consisted of all in vitro studies up to October 2024 that documented the application of cone-beam computed tomography in creating a guide for endodontic retreatment cases. The reviewers assessed the quality of the selected studies using the QUIN tool. Data regarding the first author and publication year, sample size, tooth type, retreatment application, computer-aided navigation technique, groups, image acquisition method, outcome measures, guided technique results, conventional technique results, and the main results were extracted using a predefined template. Results: Based on our criteria, seven studies were included in this review. The studies demonstrated variability in the techniques utilized. Iatrogenic errors were less frequent in guided groups, regardless of the operator’s level of experience. Most studies indicated that guided endodontics was more effective than conventional methods, particularly in fiber post-removal and access through MTA, minimizing volumetric loss of tooth structure, and preserving fracture resistance. However, when using guided techniques for removal of separated instruments, more iatrogenic errors occurred, and more time was required compared to the freehand technique. Conclusion: Guided endodontics has shown promise in improving the outcomes of non-surgical retreatment by reducing complications. However, as all included studies were in vitro, clinical evidence is lacking, and the generalization of these results should be done cautiously. Further well-designed clinical studies are required to confirm these findings.",Iranian endodontic journal,2025.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11808322, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Incorporating GenAI into Technical Writing Assignments,"In an effort to foster critical reflection on the usage of generative AI (genAI) during computer science writing assignments, this three-part assignment challenges students to predict whether their peers can detect which essays are generated using AI. Implemented as part of a third-year professional responsibility and technical writing course for N=200 students during Spring 2024, students individually generated two short persuasive essays, one using genAI and the other without. They then combined the two essays into a single document and submitted it for peer-review. Additionally, they formulated a guess on whether their peers would be able to detect which essay was generated as well as a rationale for their guess.

The methodology, with a non-experimental design and qualitative approach, involved a search in Scopus, identifying 643 documents between 1975-2024, analyzed through VOSviewer and Bibliometrix. The results show an emerging field, but with rapid growth (4.59% per year), with notoriety of Kong, Abdulrahman and Chai. Research is predominantly in computer science (61%), social sciences (33%) and engineering (23%) from China, USA, Spain and Taiwan. Current applications focus on the use of AI in education, machine learning, support for academic decisions and student mental health. However, it is necessary to expand the approach towards ethical and regulatory aspects and the evaluation of multifaceted effects on different student profiles. In conclusion, although production is growing rapidly, more comprehensive perspectives are required to responsibly enhance the impact of these technologies on the university educational experience.

The second statistical method is to analyze the design of a factorial experiment to study the presence or absence of significant differences between the grades of students in the four stages by classifying the students in the four stages into males and females, as well as studying the significant difference in the scores of the two intelligence tests (general and emotional) for students in the Mathematics Department in general and divided according to gender. requester. The third method of analysis was to analyze the design of a completely randomized experiment to study the significant differences in students’ intelligence scores between the four academic levels in the mathematics department. If there is a significant difference in the results of analyzing the data in the above methods, then we use the fourth statistical method in this research, which is the analysis of the least significant difference test to study the differences between each two groups separately. The results of the data analysis were numerous, the most important of which is that the intelligence scores in the two tests (general intelligence and emotional intelligence) do not depend on nor are affected by the student’s gender or type of residence. In addition, intelligence scores were not affected for the four educational levels.",Communications on Applied Nonlinear Analysis,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.52783/cana.v31.829?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.52783/cana.v31.829, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

741ac17a00dac477c233544e87ede6d5095bfd57,How to Improve Test Performance by Moodle Statistics,"Creation of properly balanced tests and their evaluation is an important part of the educational process, which is dealt with by the theory of testing. The most popular testing theories are Classical test theory and Item response theory. In this paper, we will focus on metrics used in the Item response theory, which deals with evaluating the performance of the test from the point of view of individual questions, through metrics such as the Discrimination index, Item difficulty, Random score estimate, and others. In the 2023/2024 academic term, 239 second-year students in the field of computer science participated in the Operating Systems course. After passing each test, we proceeded to evaluate the test performance based on the statistics available in the MoodIe system. We evaluated a total of 41 testing items, primarily focused on Discrimination index, Item difficulty, Intended weight and Efficiency weight. We identified 5 testing items, which do not perform well enough. In order to be able to evaluate the overall test performance, we decided to calculate the reliability of the test using the Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR20) metric. KR20 metric is used to measure the internal consistency reliability of a test. We calculated the KR20 value before adjusting all three tests, and also after adjusting the tests. In all three cases there was an improvement in the value of KR20 in the interval from 3.63% to 5.37%, which indicates higher internal consistency of all three tests. Conclusion: We evaluated test performance of 3 tests based on the MoodIe statistics. We identified five testing items that were shown not to work based on manual verification as well as on the MoodIe test statistics. We eliminated those testing items and observed an improvement in the test reliability calculated by KR20 metric, resulting in an improvement in test performance.",International Conference on Emerging eLearning Technologies and Applications,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICETA63795.2024.10850813?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETA63795.2024.10850813, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Globally, according to a report from the World Health Organization (WHO), it is estimated that the total number of overweight and obese children in the world could reach 75 million by the year 2025. Objective: It was to carry out a systematic review to present the main approaches to clinical and metabolomics of childhood obesity. Methods: The PRISMA Platform systematic review rules were followed. The research was carried out from September to October 2024 in the Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, Scielo and Google Scholar databases. The quality of the studies was based on the GRADE instrument and the risk of bias was analyzed according to the Cochrane instrument. Results and Conclusion: 110 articles were recruited for the initial evaluation. A total of 41 articles were evaluated and 19 were included in this systematic review. Considering the Cochrane tool for risk of bias, the overall assessment resulted in 28 studies with a high risk of bias and 28 studies that did not meet GRADE. Most studies showed homogeneity in their results, with X2=89.7%>50%. It was concluded that miRNAs are potential biomarkers for the development of pathologies, such as obesity. A heterogeneous group of these molecules was found to be associated with obesity in children. miR-15b-5p, miR-486-5p and hsa-miR-122-5p were considered good candidates for childhood obesity biomarkers.

A quasi-experimental research design was utilized, involving 12 purposively selected Grade 8 students from Rufino I. Chungalao Science High School (RICSHS), Ifugao, Philippines, during the school year 2024-2025. The selected respondents were divided into two groups: an experimental group, which used the E-LaB Game, and a control group, which followed conventional teaching methods. A 30-item validated identification test was administered as both a pre-test and post-test to assess learning gains. Statistical tools such as paired t-tests, independent t-tests, and effect size calculations (eta squared) were employed for data analysis. Results revealed that students who used the E-LaB Game demonstrated a remarkable improvement in their ability to determine the number of protons, electrons, and neutrons. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in students' performance before and after using the E-LaB Game, confirming its effectiveness as a learning and remediating tool to enhance their mastery in determining the number of protons, electrons, and neutrons. Based from the findings, it is recommended that more Element and ladder Board Game (E-LaB GAME) learning activities will be employed to reinforce the performance of the Grade 8 students to the number of protons, electrons and neutrons. To future researchers, the E-LaB GAME may be localized in order to be suitable and presentable to learners in a way that is more facilitating, stimulating, and exciting for the learners and become enthusiastic and eager to learn. In addition, to improve the reliability and generalizability of the research findings, consider increasing the sample size by adding more respondents.","Pedagogy Review: An International Journal of Educational Theories, Approaches and Strategies",2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.62718/vmca.pr-ijetas.4.2.sc-0125-030?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.62718/vmca.pr-ijetas.4.2.sc-0125-030, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6aa06f95d8fc3d3e7c64bc6b156a20a46cfda9e9,ANALISIS PERSEPSI SISWA TERHADAP KEBUTUHAN MODUL PEMBELAJARAN IPA TERINTEGRASI AYAT AL-QUR’AN PADA MATERI PENCEMARAN LINGKUNGAN,"The science learning at MTs N 2 Ciamis still uses separate teaching materials, where religious education focuses on religious topics, while science is limited to scientific material without integrating Islamic values. The lack of learning resources that combine both aspects causes difficulties for teachers in designing lessons that link religious and scientific aspects. This study aims to analyze students' perceptions of the need for an IPA module integrated with Quranic verses on environmental pollution. This research uses a descriptive quantitative method with 20 students from class VIII-F Science at MTs Negeri 2 Ciamis in the 2024/2025 academic year, selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected using a questionnaire consisting of 10 statements across 3 indicators. The results of the study show that all indicators were rated positively: 1) students' views on environmental pollution material reached 81%, categorized as good; 2) students' views on the connection between science material and Quranic verses were also good, at 80%; and 3) students' views on the need for an IPA learning module reached 85%, categorized as good. The conclusion of this study is that students need a learning module integrated with Quranic verses because this integrated learning approach is considered to make the learning process more relevant, effective, and meaningful. Integrating Quranic verses into science learning can create a deeper and more effective learning experience, especially on the topic of environmental pollution. This approach helps students understand concepts holistically, encompassing both scientific and spiritual aspects.
ABSTRAKPembelajaran IPA di MTs N 2 Ciamis masih menggunakan bahan ajar terpisah, dimana mata pelajaran agama fokus pada topik keagamaan, sedangkan IPA terbatas pada materi sains tanpa integrasi nilai-nilai Islam. Keterbatasan sumber belajar yang menggabungkan keduanya menyebabkan kesulitan bagi guru dalam merancang pembelajaran yang menghubungkan aspek keagamaan dan ilmiah. Penelitian ini bertujuan menganalisis persepsi siswa terhadap kebutuhan modul IPA terintegrasi ayat Al-Qur'an pada pencemaran lingkungan. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode deskriptif kuantitatif dengan subjek sebanyak 20 siswa kelas VIII-F Sains di MTs Negeri 2 Ciamis tahun ajaran 2024/2025, yang ditentukan melalui teknik purposive sampling. Data diperoleh melalui pengisian angket yang berisi 10 pernyataan dalam 3 indikator. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan baik pada semua indikator, yaitu: 1) pandangan siswa terhadap materi pencemaran lingkungan sebesar 81% sehingga berkategori baik, 2) pandangan siswa terhadap keterkaitan materi IPA dengan ayat-ayat Al-Qur’an juga baik yaitu sebesar 80%, dan 3) pandangan siswa terhadap kebutuhan modul pembelajaran IPA sebesar 85% berkategori baik. Kesimpulan dari penelitian ini adalah siswa membutuhkan modul pembelajaran yang terintegrasi ayat-ayat Al-Qur’an, karena pembelajaran yang terintegrasi ini dinilai mampu membuat proses belajar lebih relevan, efektif, dan bermakna. Pengintegrasian ayat-ayat Al-Qur’an dalam pembelajaran IPA dapat menciptakan pengalaman belajar yang lebih mendalam dan efektif, khususnya pada materi pencemaran lingkungan. Pendekatan ini memudahkan siswa untuk memahami konsep secara holistik, yang meliputi aspek ilmiah dan spiritual.",SCIENCE : Jurnal Inovasi Pendidikan Matematika dan IPA,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.51878/science.v5i1.4509?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.51878/science.v5i1.4509, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fe7d9a9a6dcf9e12f44de60a6c9038bf531018d4,PROFIL LITERASI EKOLOGI PESERTA DIDIK DALAM PEMBELAJARAN IPA DI SMPN 1,"A healthy ecosystem depends on good ecological literacy, but students' environmental awareness is still low. This study aims to analyze the ecological literacy profile of students in science learning at SMPN 1 Parigi. The method used is descriptive quantitative with an instrument in the form of a questionnaire that measures three indicators of ecological literacy, namely ecological participation, ecological awareness, and ecological skills. This study involved 32 class VIII students as a sample and was carried out in the odd semester of the 2024/2025 academic year. The results showed that the ecological literacy of students was in a poor category with an average score of 38.23. In more detail, the ecological participation indicator obtained the highest score of 38.75, while the ecological skills indicator was the lowest with a score of 37.81. This low score is due to the lack of direct experience-based learning, lack of relevant learning resources, and the suboptimal integration of ecological issues in the science curriculum. The research results recommend the application of Problem-Based Learning based on local wisdom to link learning with surrounding environmental issues. In addition, the use of technology in ecological learning, such as interactive digital platforms, the use of IoT-based environmental sensors, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based simulations, can be an innovative strategy in increasing students' understanding. Technology enables real-time environmental data analysis and provides a deeper and evidence-based learning experience. Thus, the integration of technology in ecological education is expected to increase students' awareness and skills in facing environmental challenges more effectively. This effort is important to form a more environmentally conscious generation and contribute to sustainable ecological preservation.
ABSTRAKEkosistem yang sehat bergantung pada literasi ekologi yang baik, namun kesadaran lingkungan peserta didik masih rendah. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis profil literasi ekologi peserta didik dalam pembelajaran IPA di SMPN 1 Parigi. Metode yang digunakan adalah deskriptif kuantitatif dengan instrumen berupa kuesioner yang mengukur tiga indikator literasi ekologi, yaitu partisipasi ekologi, kesadaran ekologi, dan keterampilan ekologi. Penelitian ini melibatkan 32 peserta didik kelas VIII sebagai sampel dan dilaksanakan pada semester ganjil tahun ajaran 2024/2025. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa literasi ekologi peserta didik berada pada kategori kurang baik dengan rata-rata skor 38,23. Secara lebih rinci, indikator partisipasi ekologi memperoleh skor tertinggi sebesar 38,75, sedangkan indikator keterampilan ekologi menjadi yang terendah dengan skor 37,81. Rendahnya skor ini disebabkan oleh minimnya pembelajaran berbasis pengalaman langsung, kurangnya sumber belajar yang relevan, serta belum optimalnya integrasi isu ekologi dalam kurikulum IPA. Hasil penelitian merekomendasikan penerapan Problem-Based Learning berbasis kearifan lokal untuk mengaitkan pembelajaran dengan isu lingkungan sekitar. Selain itu, pemanfaatan teknologi dalam pembelajaran ekologi, seperti platform digital interaktif, penggunaan sensor lingkungan berbasis IoT, dan simulasi berbasis kecerdasan buatan (AI), dapat menjadi strategi inovatif dalam meningkatkan pemahaman peserta didik. Teknologi memungkinkan analisis data lingkungan secara real-time dan memberikan pengalaman belajar yang lebih mendalam serta berbasis bukti. Dengan demikian, integrasi teknologi dalam pendidikan ekologi diharapkan dapat meningkatkan kesadaran dan keterampilan peserta didik dalam menghadapi tantangan lingkungan secara lebih efektif.

Methods/Study Population: The first cohort of thirty-one students started in January 2024 and were organized into three groups that met weekly. One in-person group of students in Anchorage, AK; one in-person group in Seattle, WA; and a group of students from across the WWAMI region convened virtually. Students completed a year-long series of elective courses addressing fundamental concepts of designing, conducting, and presenting the results of a research project. Over the summer between year 1 and year 2 of medical school, students dedicated 8 weeks to full-time research activities under the supervision of their research project mentor. In Fall 2024, students prepared and presented research posters at regional poster sessions and abstracts and oral presentations for submission to the Western Medical Research Conference in January 2025. Results/Anticipated Results: The ultimate goal of the CTR pathway is to increase the number of medical providers across the WWAMI region with significant awareness, interest, and experience in research. Many students hesitate to engage in research due to a perceived lack of necessary skills. The CTR pathway addresses this gap by equipping students with the research competencies needed to participate confidently in scientific inquiry. Feedback from the inaugural cohort has been overwhelmingly positive, with many students highlighting how the CTR pathway enhanced their confidence and knowledge, empowering them to execute their proposed research projects successfully. Our second cohort of students joined the CTR pathway in January 2025. Discussion/Significance of Impact: The CTR pathway positions early medical students to engage in research more deeply during their medical training and prepares them to seek additional training opportunities toward a career in research.

Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE databases up until June 2024 identified original studies on needle navigation in MICS. Eligible studies were those published within the past decade and that performed MICS requiring needle navigation technologies in adult patients. Animal studies, case reports, clinical trials, or laboratory experiments were excluded to focus on actively deployed techniques in clinical practice. Extracted data included the study year, modalities used, procedures performed, and the reported strengths and limitations, from which the requirements for an optimal needle navigation system were derived. Results: Of 36 eligible articles, 21 used ultrasound (US) for real-time imaging despite depth and needle visibility challenges. Computer tomography (CT)-guided fluoroscopy, cited in 19 articles, enhanced deep structure visualization but involved radiation risks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), though excellent for soft-tissue contrast, was not used due to metallic tool incompatibility. Multimodal techniques, like US–fluoroscopy fusion, improved accuracy but added cost and workflow complexity. No single technology meets all the criteria for an ideal needle navigation system, which should combine real-time imaging, 3D spatial awareness, and tissue integrity feedback while being cost-effective and easily integrated into existing workflows. Conclusions: This review derived the criteria and obstacles an ideal needle navigation system must address before its clinical adoption, along with novel technological approaches that show potential to overcome those challenges. For instance, fusion technologies overlay information from multiple visual approaches within a single interface to overcome individual limitations. Additionally, emerging diagnostic methods like vibroacoustic sensing or optical fiber needles offer information from complementary sensory channels, augmenting visual approaches with insights into tissue integrity and structure, thereby paving the way for enhanced needle navigation systems in MICS.",Diagnostics,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics15020197', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11763737, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1ecc201f774fc3189f7e5a7efa8e272cee97350a,Strengthening Evidence-Based Practice in Malaysia: Improving the Public CPR Awareness Time Model for Self- Vital Monitoring,"Cardiac arrest is a significant global health issue, with over 20,000 paediatric cases annually in the United States (AHA, 2020), and in Malaysia, coronary heart disease affects approximately 29,363 individuals each year, contributing heavily to national health concerns (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2021). To address this challenge, this study aims to strengthen evidence-based practice (EBP) in Malaysia through the integration of the TIME model (Transform, Innovate, Model, Enhancement) for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) public awareness for vital selfcare monitoring, particularly focusing on pulse monitoring and perfusion index (PI) as essential components of patient care. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, this research is grounded in the American Nurses Association’s (ANA, 2024) EBP model. The primary objectives of the study are: (1) to assess the factors influencing the implementation of various CPR practices and public health monitoring awareness, (2) to analyse the relationship between CPR approaches and public health monitoring awareness through statistical regression analysis, and (3) to develop an EBP practice guide for strategic CPR awareness. A comprehensive literature review utilizing databases such as OUM e-library, Science Direct, AHA, and ResearchGate provided insights from over 150 relevant sources. A mixed-methods design was applied, including quantitative data from surveys and qualitative data from open-ended questionnaires, with a sample of 200 final-year nursing students. Findings will inform the development of a recommended EBP model enhancement and strategic CPR guidelines, culminating in an eBook for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) public awareness for vital selfcare monitoring 2025-2030. The TIME model’s application in this context serves as a transformative and innovative framework that fosters best practices in CPR training and enhances public health awareness, on collaboration, patient-centred care, and the sustainability of health outcomes in Malaysia. focusing of Pulse Self-Monitoring for Public Awareness and CPR Readiness in Malaysia.",International journal of research and innovation in social science,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47772/ijriss.2025.9020194?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2025.9020194, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

95591821ebc5501ea01d922908f3bb08013f4a7b,Comments: Celebrating a Legacy: 100 Years of Innovation and 75 Years of JPT at the 2024 ATCE,"
 
 Are you ready to join us for SPE’s Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition (ATCE) in New Orleans, 23–25 September?
 As SPE celebrates a century of innovation at the 2024 ATCE, we also mark the 75th anniversary of the Journal of Petroleum Technology (JPT).
 These twin milestones stand as a testament to the achievements that have driven our field forward—innovation, pushing boundaries, setting new standards, and fueling the energy that powers the world.
 Through the highs of technological breakthroughs and the lows of economic challenges, the oil and gas industry—and ATCE and JPT—have continually evolved, proving their resilience and adaptability.
 When considering the innovations in our industry, key advancements that often stand out include hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, deepwater exploration, enhanced oil recovery, digitalization and automation, LNG technology, FPSOs, subsea systems, and decarbonization and emissions mitigation.
 However, the incremental steps that collectively contributed to the broadly defined “wow” factors above are equally notable. To mention only a sampling: enhanced drill-bit designs, advancements in onshore and offshore drilling rigs, real-time data collection, development of 4D seismic technology, integration of multiple data types (e.g., seismic, well logs, production data) for more-comprehensive reservoir characterization, materials-science advancements (polymers, nanocoatings), development of blowout preventers, improved leak-detection systems, and advancements in produced-water treatment and recycling technologies.
 Less often recognized are the failures that were essential prerequisites for eventual success. The ""fail fast, fail often"" approach allowed for rapid feedback and necessary adjustments, though it also contributed to the downfall of some startups over the years.
 As individuals, embracing failure and viewing it as a stepping stone to success is not always our natural response. Presentations at industry events on ""lessons learned"" vary in transparency, often influenced by differing definitions of failure, stakeholder sensitivities, and legal considerations.
 As a result, many of the hard knocks that paved the way for the industry's ""wow"" factors remain largely unknown.
 ATCE’s theme, “Powering the Future of Energy with a Century of Innovation,” honors the legacy of past breakthroughs while celebrating their ongoing role in shaping a resilient and sustainable future.
 Olivier Houzé will be named 2025 SPE President with the official passing of the baton from 2024 President Terry Palisch at ATCE. In this issue of JPT, Houzé shares his insights on the challenges facing our Society and its members in his inaugural vodcast and column, “A Roadmap for a Very Busy Year.”
 Visit the SPE Pavilion (Booth 1449) in the exhibition hall for a variety of SPE Pavilion Talks, including the JPT editors on Tuesday, 24 September, at 1:30 p.m. We’ll highlight the milestones of JPT’s coverage over 75 years and their significance for the future.

2885ac6015aa5cd7743ab6b172ff650ba16ebedc,Exploring Stormwater Best Management Practices for Urban Flood Reduction in Khulna City of Bangladesh Using PCSWMM,"Khulna City Corporation (KCC), located in a low-lying area in southwestern Bangladesh, has been suffering from frequent water logging in the rainy season almost every year. This situation is intensified due to rapid urbanization and the impact of climate change, which have consequently created numerous problems in KCC related to stormwater management issues that require immediate consideration. Therefore, the current study aims to explore stormwater management problems in KCC and find possible countermeasures through different best management practices. Stormwater management must be incorporated into urban design and development, particularly in densely populated urban areas like KCC. In Ward No. 30 of KCC, controlling stormwater is a vital concern due to heavy rainfall, a lack of proper drainage infrastructure, unplanned growth, extensive land cover areas, etc. In the current study, the most widely used Personnel Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM) software was adopted to evaluate the city's current stormwater management practices and develop a long-term stormwater management strategy. A reconnaissance investigation of the existing states of the soil, drainage, and outlet infrastructures was conducted. The study area (KCC Ward No. 30) was then divided into many small catchments in the ArcGIS platform, and areas of each sub-catchment were identified. To determine the percentage of impervious area and the elevation of the study area, the land use and land cover (LULC) map and the digital elevation model (DEM) were generated using the ArcGIS software. All the aforementioned parameters were then entered into the PCSWMM software, and simulations were performed for various rainfall durations using different best management practices. The PCSWMM simulation provided the results of runoff, infiltration, peak runoff, floods, or surcharges at every drainage node or discharge point in the existing and altered drainage system of the study area due to the occurrence of extreme rainfall. The results indicate that various best management practices, increasing the slope, reducing the roughness of the drainage systems, reducing imperviousness, permitting more infiltrations, and promoting green infrastructure, are highly effective in controlling urban flooding or surcharges in the study area caused by the occurrence of extreme rainfall in the future. The findings of this study are expected to be supportive to policymakers, urban planners, and water managers in implementing and promoting sustainable and climate-resilient urban drainage infrastructures to tackle stormwater management problems in the KCC area.

CPD can be both voluntary and mandatory, depending on the dental legislation of each European country. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the key legislation aspects of CPD related with criteria for awarding CPD points to the Ukrainian doctors of all eight stomatological specialties. The number of required CPD points and criteria for awarding CPD points are regulated by (1) Order of the Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine of February 22, 2019, No. 446 “Some Issues of CPD of Doctors” and by (2) the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of July 14, 2021, No. 725 “On Approval of the Regulation on the System of CPD of Healthcare Workers”. In 2024, at least 100 CPD points obtained in 2020, 2021 and at least 50 CPD points obtained in 2022, 2023 must be submitted by stomatologist for certification. In 2025 and subsequent years, at least 50 CPD points for each previous year must be submitted for certification. All 10 types of professional activities from the criteria for awarding CPD points are described. CPD points are awarded for obtaining formal, informal (type 1) and informal (type 2) education in the field of healthcare. The biggest number of points (namely, 100 CPD points) can be awarded to a stomatologist for obtaining educational and scientific levels of higher education in the field of knowledge “Health Care” (Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science). The smallest number of points, namely three CPD points, can be obtained for a professional medical internship in Ukraine outside the institution where the employee works. Modern Ukrainian legislation provides ample opportunities for doctors-stomatologists and maxillofacial surgeons for their CPD and certification. The criteria for awarding CPD points from Order No. 446 contain a complete list of educational opportunities in Ukraine and in other countries.

2b498cdf93558b8965d1bd4ed3407557a406ecad,The Effect of Inquiry Learning Model with STEM Approach on Students' Critical Thinking Skills in Science Learning,"Critical thinking is a skill needed to solve problems in the 21st century. However, the critical thinking skills of Indonesian students are still considered low, as confirmed by PISA research results. This low critical thinking ability is due to students' limited understanding of factual and conceptual information when solving problems. One learning model that can serve as an alternative to improving students' critical thinking skills is the Inquiry model with a STEM approach. In this model, students are actively engaged in learning, as the process focuses on them. Additionally, the STEM approach enhances students' critical thinking abilities because it integrates various fields of knowledge, enabling students to think from multiple perspectives and become accustomed to critical thinking. The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of the Inquiry learning model with a STEM approach on students' critical thinking skills. This quantitative research was conducted at Mts 1 Jember during the even semester of the 2024/2025 academic year. The sample included class VIII B as the experimental group and class VIII D as the control group, selected through purposive sampling. Data collection techniques involved tests as the primary instrument, with supporting instruments such as observation, interviews, and documentation. Data analysis was conducted using the Independent Sample t-test, which showed a significance value (2-tailed) of 0.000 < 0.05. The results indicated a moderate increase in students' critical thinking skills, with a score of 0.68.

174a0d807aba5846e47605bd7d6b7f416b5b871c,Revolutionizing Education in the Rural Elementary School: Leveraging Instructional Automation and Interactive Assessment,"Abstract
Aim: Transformation in education includes integrating artificial intelligence, enhancing teaching competencies, and administrating administrative tasks that require highly skilled and competent teachers to utilize technological tools in the classroom and save more time from other administrative work. This study aimed to assess the readiness of revolutionizing education, the level of instructional automation, and the extent of assessment measures utilized in rural elementary schools and their significant interconnectedness by looking at the perspectives of teachers and learners. 
Methodology: The study employed a descriptive evaluative design and correlational research design; utilizing a researcher-made questionnaire. The study was conducted among 129 teachers and 220 learners in 13 elementary schools of North President Quirino District for the school year 2024-2025. The data were analyzed using mean and standard deviation, Pearson correlation coefficient and One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
Results: The data reveals that both teachers and learners are highly ready to revolutionize education, with an overall mean of 3.76 for teachers and 4.08 for learners. A strong level of instructional leverage among teachers and learners with overall mean of 4.00 for teachers and 3.97 for learners. For the extent of assessment measures utilized in North President Quirino District findings show an overall mean of 3.93 for teachers and 4.14 for learners, both interpreted as high extent. Furthermore, there is a strong positive correlation (r) of 0.688 for teachers and a very strong positive correlation with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.874 for the learners between revolutionizing education and leveraging instructional automation. A very strong positive correlation between revolutionizing education and interactive assessment , as indicated on the correlation coefficient of (r) 0.888 for teachers and (r) 0.691 for the learners. Moreover, there is a significant difference on teachers and learners’ response on revolutionizing education with an f-value of 1.644 and a p-value of .042; f-value of 1.836 and a p-value of .015 for instructional automation; and an f-value of 2.499 and a p-value of 0.001. 
Conclusion: The study findings reveal that rural elementary schools exhibit moderate to high readiness for educational transformation, particularly through AI integration, enhanced teaching competencies, and automated administrative tasks. Strengths lie in strategic planning and professional development, though resource allocation and collaboration with tech firms remain challenges. Instructional automation improves efficiency in teaching and administration but raises concerns about reduced teacher-learner interactions, highlighting the need for a balanced approach. Assessment methods remain diverse, with pen-and-paper tests complemented by computer-aided, game-based, and practical exams, the latter excelling in real-world application. A strong positive relationship exists between education reform, instructional automation, and interactive assessments. However, a gap in perception between teachers and learners highlights the need for better training and collaboration to ensure shared ownership of educational advancements.

d5d9015ddc84b2f305d7d4c59092f24e4a145356,"Relationship between digital health literacy, distrust in the health system and health anxiety in health sciences students","Health anxiety is frequently observed in university students in all segments of society. Health anxiety is also frequently encountered in health sciences students, who will play the most effective role in developing and protecting public health in the future. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relationships between digital health literacy, distrust in health systems, and health anxiety and the effects of these two factors on health anxiety in students studying health sciences. The cross-sectional study population comprised students from the Health Sciences departments at Kutahya Health Sciences University during the 2024–2025 academic year. The study data were collected using a questionnaire form prepared online for the students studying in these departments. A total of 752 questionnaire forms were analyzed. The average age of the students who participated in the study was 21.42 ± 1.68 years, and 71% of the students were female. A total of 15.16% of the students were studying in the Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, and 97.47% of them accessed the Internet via mobile phones. According to the correlation analysis, there was a positive correlation between health anxiety and distrust in health systems and a negative correlation between health anxiety and digital health literacy. According to the multiple regression analysis results, digital health literacy and distrust in health systems explained 21.9% of the change in health anxiety.

47b962bfb259d158419d8e35e38a5a6bd7b10911,Comprehensive Global Analysis of Future Trends in Artificial Intelligence‐Assisted Veterinary Medicine,"ABSTRACT Background This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of global trends in ‘artificial intelligence studies in veterinary medicine’. The analysis aims to summarise the publications of researchers from various disciplines related to artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine, thereby predicting future trends of AI in this field. The primary objective of the study is to investigate publications pertaining to artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine worldwide and to analyse trends and future developments in this area. Methods This bibliometric study examines artificial intelligence research in veterinary medicine conducted worldwide from 1990 to 2024. To achieve this, a search using the keywords ‘artificial intelligence’ and ‘veterinary medicine’ was performed in the Web of Science (WOS) database, resulting in the identification of 1497 studies. After excluding irrelevant publications and those outside the scope of articles, a total of 1400 articles were included in the analysis. The data collection process utilised titles, author names, publication years, journal names, and citation counts. All textual data were analysed using VOSviewer software to ensure accuracy and reliability. In this study, analyses conducted through text mining and data visualisation techniques (e.g., bubble maps) facilitated a clearer understanding of the results. Results This study presents information about 1400 articles obtained from the WOS database and a total of 44,700 citations for these articles. The average number of citations per article is 32, with an H‐index of 74. A rapid increase in both the number of articles and citations has been observed since 2019. The majority of the articles (30%) were published in the fields of veterinary sciences, artificial intelligence, and computer sciences. The United States, Taiwan and the United Kingdom are the leading countries, accounting for 84% of the published articles in this field. Additionally, 12% of the articles were published in the area of veterinary sciences, and 85% of the articles fall within the SCI‐Expanded category. Conclusions The findings of our study indicate that there are numerous active researchers in the field of artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine and that research in this area is steadily increasing. This bibliometric analysis highlights global trends and significant works in artificial intelligence within veterinary medicine, providing valuable insights into the future directions of research in this field. As the analysis aims solely to identify trends and patterns in the literature, it does not intend to evaluate the applicability of the subject matter. Highlights Analysis of Global Trends: This study comprehensively analyses the global trends and effects of research on artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine. In this context, it contributes to the identification of significant changes and developments in the literature. Rapidly Spreading Research: Research on artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine has rapidly expanded in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue. The increase in studies indicates an expansion of knowledge and applications in this field.

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang databases were comprehensively searched up to January 12, 2024 for studies that compared immediate versus delayed insertion of IUDs after abortion. The evaluation metrics included the number of IUD insertion after surgical or medical abortions, the frequency of expulsion and removal at 6 months or 1 year, the number of continued usage, pain intensity scores, the number of infections, the duration of bleeding, and instances of uterine perforation during or after IUD insertion. Ten randomized controlled articles were eligible, comprising 11 research projects, of which 3 projects involved the placement of an IUD after surgical abortion, and 8 projects involved the placement of an IUD after medical abortion. This included 2025 patients (977 in the immediate insertion group and 1,048 in the delayed insertion group). We summarized all the extracted evidence. The meta-analysis results indicated that for post-surgical abortions, the immediate insertion group exhibited a higher IUD placement rate than the delayed insertion group. After medical abortions, the immediate insertion group showed higher rates of IUD placement, utilization, and expulsion at 6 months or 1 year. The two groups showed no statistically significant differences in the removal rate, post-insertion infection rate, pain scores during insertion, and days of bleeding during the follow-up period. Compared to delayed placement, immediate insertion of IUDs can not only increase the usage rate at 6 months or 1 year but also enhance the placement rate.",Scientific Reports,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-62327-1.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11102502, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5ab0f46f150f4debbcb4d2e7b7c8fd55bca86265,A Need Analysis of ESP For Nursing Science Students at Stik Bina Husada Palembang,"The English language skills are also a determinant factor in the process of global knowledge exchange in various fields, including health, science, and technology. The connection between student needs and inadequate teaching approaches emphasizes the urgency of reforming English curricula in higher education. Identifying students’ needs in learning English is an important step in designing more effective and relevant curriculum and teaching methods. At STIK Bina Husada Palembang, English learning discusses the integration of four basic English language skills, namely speaking, listening, reading, and writing including aspects of grammar and vocabulary into the scope of nursing services and work both in clinical/community practice and in classroom and/or laboratory learning. In English language learning, need analysis helps educators design a curriculum that is appropriate to students' learning needs. By understanding these needs, teachers can develop relevant materials and target the language skills that are most useful to students in a particular context, such as academic, business, or everyday English. In this study, 150 students of the Nursing Science study program at STIK Bina Husada Palembang participated in the 2024/2025 academic year, but only 149 students filled out the Google form completely. The instrument used is a questionnaire that focuses on personal information, English language proficiency, and English language goals.

To identify the most effective treatment modality for achieving favorable outcomes in early glottic tumors with anterior commissure involvement (ACI).


DATA SOURCES
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect.


REVIEW METHODS
Random-effects proportional meta-analysis model is used to evaluate the oncological and functional outcomes of transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) versus radiation therapy (RT) in early glottic (T1-T2) cancer with ACI.


RESULTS
From a total of 736 studies, 40 studies were included, comprising 2666 early glottic tumor patients with ACI. TLM (52%) and upfront RT (48%) were the primary treatment groups. TLM had better 5-year overall survival (OS) (84.5% [80.3%-88.0%] vs. 79.4% [75.7%-82.7%]). Similarly, TLM-treated patients had better 3-year pooled disease-free survival (DFS) compared with RT-treated patients (82.7% [77.1%-87.1%] vs. 73.3% [23.8%-96.0%]). TLM exhibited a better 5-year local control rate (LCR) than RT (77.2% vs. 71.6%). In our temporal analysis, TLM had a higher 5-year LCR than RT (78.2% vs. 63.5%) in 2001-2012, with similar rates in 2013-2024 (76.8% vs. 78.4%). TLM-treated patients had higher laryngeal preservation rates compared with RT patients (93% [90.6%-94.8%] vs. 87.6% [82.8%-91.2%]).


CONCLUSIONS
Our meta-analysis is the first in the literature to compare the outcomes between TLM and RT-treated patients with ACI in early glottic tumors. TLM-treated patients appear to have superior 5-year OS and laryngeal preservation compared with upfront RT-treated patients. However, both TLM and RT exhibited comparable oncological outcomes in early glottic tumor patients with ACI during the recent period from 2013 to 2024.

81d1bdca593d70e2539a18bf077221656c86cc2f,Factors Influencing Domestic Human Trafficking in Africa: Protocol for a Scoping Review,"Background Human trafficking is a human rights violation in every region of the world. The African continent is not spared. Every year, millions of people experience significant health and social consequences. International organizations and governments combating human trafficking are hindered by a lack of knowledge about what factors influence domestic (within-country) human trafficking. Objective This study aims to conduct a scoping review to collate and synthesize literature on factors influencing domestic trafficking in Africa. Methods We will follow Arksey and O’Malley’s framework to answer the question about reported influences on domestic human trafficking and their relative weight. The search strategy will explore PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus. A total of 2 independent researchers will select quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods studies that examine relationships influencing domestic human trafficking. We will document our results by following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. We will extract a list of all reported relationships between identified factors influencing domestic human trafficking in each study. Based on a discourse analysis approach, we will weigh the strengths of the relationships based on how frequently they are reported across the included studies. We will summarize the findings as fuzzy cognitive maps depicting the relationships reported in the literature. The maps represent the influences between concepts (nodes) linked by arrows (edges) going from each cause to its outcomes. These maps are helpful visual summaries of the factors associated with domestic human trafficking, allowing a comparison with maps to be created by stakeholder groups. Results This project received financial support in March 2023. We expect to start the project in March 2024. We recruited 2 research staff members to conduct the scoping review and expect to publish the results in March 2025. Conclusions The review will provide a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing domestic human trafficking in Africa. The overlap of human trafficking with other forms of exploitation, the limited literature on domestic human trafficking, and the likely diversity of factors are challenges for the review. We propose strategies to address these challenges.

bf03a2867d1d1a00cfcb8cfb71818416540b7ca5,Strengthening Health Security through Sustainable Vaccine Economics and Equity,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted substantial inequities in access to vaccines. A primary reason behind this inequity was the concentration of manufacturing capacity in developed regions of the world. The lack of a distributed spread of local facilities has meant that many countries are reliant on global suppliers and manufacturers, making the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) vulnerable to pandemics.1 Addressing this imbalance in terms of accessibility to life-saving vaccines is crucial for health security and vaccine equity. 
Gavi’s new five-year strategy (Gavi 6.0’ for 2026–2030) aims to address these issues with a vision “leaving no one behind with immunisation”. GAVI mission was revised for Gavi 5.0 and puts ‘equity’ at the heart of the Alliance’s strategy to increase equitable and sustainable use of vaccines. GAVI 6.0 incorporates a new principle on the climate change while equity will remain at the core of Gavi’s next strategy, as a key contribution to the Immunisation Agenda 2030 (IA 2030) and the Sustainable Development Goals. At the heart of the Gavi model is also a unique approach to programmatic and financial sustainability.2 Grounded in Gavi’s eligibility, transition and co-financing (ELTRACO) policy, the model has been highly successful so far in bolstering country ownership of vaccine programmes and in driving domestic public resource allocation towards immunisation. From 2011 to 2023, countries increased their resources for Gavi-supported vaccines from US$ 36 million to US$ 630 million, representing 41% of the combined investment by Gavi and countries into routine, Gavi-supported vaccines. At the end of 2023, 19 countries had fully transitioned out of Gavi support. 
In line with Gavi’s vaccine policy, based on the country’s Gross National Income (GNI); Pakistan will eventually graduate from GAVI support which would result in added economic capitals to sustain the vaccine accessibility which are acquired as country co-financing share. Despite progress, immunisation coverage in Pakistan remains low, and the country has not met its 2015 health, nutrition, and population (HNP) Millennium Development Goals targets.4 Establishing a local vaccine manufacturing facility is imperative to reduce reliance on contract manufacturing and streamline the supply chain for the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) and health security. 
The BioNTech mRNA Vaccine Manufacturing Facility in Rwanda serves as a model for sustainable vaccine production in LMICs. With a $150 million investment and local personnel training, the facility aims to produce mRNA-based vaccines by 2025, promoting vaccine production and supply in African Union member states. Similar initiatives can be replicated regionally to enhance vaccine self-sufficiency.5 Currently, over 60% of BCG and over 80% of measles vaccines are produced in India and Indonesia, underscoring the need for Pakistan to develop its vaccine production capabilities. The domestic market’s annual vaccine intake is Rs 17.6 billion, indicating substantial demand and potential for local manufacturing.6 
Developing the capacity for essential immunisation in the country requires more than market-driven solutions. Achieving global vaccine equity demands transparency, active government oversight, favourable intellectual property policies, proactive technology transfers, and building regional technical, manufacturing, and regulatory capacities. Public-private partnerships (PPP) can expedite the establishment of Bioequivalence and Bioavailability centres, ensuring sustainable vaccine technology aligned with international standards (FDA, WHO, EU). By addressing these challenges, we can create a resilient and equitable global health security system, ensuring vaccine equity and sustainability in the fight against infectious diseases.

28fcad008483c60b8ae08f9530e6923488eccd42,Enhancing Taxonomic Skills in West Africa and Supporting the Growth of GC Herbarium (Ghana),"Training the next generation of environmental scientists is critical to the future of life on Earth as acknowledged in 2021 by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG, Kew) in Our Manifesto for Change. RBG, Kew is also committed to strengthening capacity in the most biodiverse tropical countries by sharing expertise and collections, to enhance the global conservation effort. Developing training programmes to enhance taxonomic capacity in Africa and meeting the demand for early career in-country taxonomists was identified as the first step to accelerate the documentation and conservation of African plant diversity.
 Two years ago, RBG, Kew, in collaboration with the University of Ghana and the Ghana Herbarium (GC) and with support from the Schroder Charity Trust and Mallinckrodt Foundation, developed a tailored “Plant Taxonomy Skills for Ecology and Conservation” training course. This was planned to run in Africa, South America and Asia, alternating each year. The pilot was organised in Ghana, Africa in 2022. Participants for this 5-week course were selected from over 260 applicants. Delivered in a hybrid format, the course started with 3 weeks of online lectures, pre-recorded by 15 plant scientists and curators at RBG, Kew, as well as online interactive sessions. This was then followed by 2 weeks of in-person training in Ghana, including a 1-day field trip for practical collecting tips. The training covered herbarium curation techniques as well as concepts and skills needed for taxonomic revisions such as nomenclature, taxonomy, analysis of herbarium specimens, databasing, geo-referencing, preparation of morphological descriptions, diagnosis and identification keys as well as building distribution maps and red listing. The in-country teaching team included a curator-botanist, a plant taxonomist, a science education coordinator from RBG, Kew and two professors from University of Ghana. The course ended with a written assignment in the form of a taxonomic revision. A short survey was sent out to all course participants two years after the course to gather impacts of the training on their careers and uncover the most positive and negative aspects of the course.
 The course provided many positive outcomes: 15 plant taxonomists from eight African countries were trained, and jointly produced a taxonomic revision of 28 species of Ipomoea L. (Convolvulaceae) from Ghana (Williams et al. 2024). Additionally, The African Taxonomists Network was initiated by the course participants with a mission of ‘Fostering the next generation of taxonomists to bridge the generational gap and revitalize the relevance of taxonomy in Africa for the future.’ This network now has over 60 members, meets regularly online, and has a large presence on social media. Furthermore, the course also resulted in the awarding of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) Biodiversity Challenge grant to the GC Herbarium in 2022. This grant enabled acquiring essential plant collecting equipment and herbarium materials, either by sourcing them in Ghana or from abroad. The GC herbarium, founded in 1952, contains ~85,000 collections of plant and algae specimens from Ghana and across West Africa with high historical, teaching and research value. This collection is vital to enhancing in-country taxonomic capacity. Therefore, the improvement and upgrade supported by the grant, as well as its recognition, are essential. Another rewarding impact of the course is strengthening of links between RBG, Kew and African institutions of higher education. These links have quickly developed into a larger partnership and were the first step towards a long-term collaboration. The ultimate objective of this collaboration has been to create the necessary conditions, both in infrastructure and human capacity to deliver the Flora of Ghana. This will be achieved by implementing a project to support the maintenance and growth of the GC herbarium in addition to taxonomic capacity building and teaching.
 The participants benefited from the course by engaging with mentors, networking and exchanging ideas, forming links with individuals with similar research interests and obtaining additional training and career progression opportunities. In the feedback survey, all participants reported that this course made them consider a career or future studies in plant taxonomy and 80% of the participants reported securing a new job or a student position in plant taxonomy two years after the course. In addition, all participants listed several positive impacts of the course on their career such as confidence in producing a taxonomic revision, gaining herbarium management skills and opportunities for new collaborations. This course has been subsequently successfully run in South America (Bolivia) and Asia (Indonesia), with expectations of similarly positive outcomes, and is already planned to return to Africa (Kenya) in 2025.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139237', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.139237?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139237, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2ce043315170599664a2f02597566509b0121f94,Kazakh mathematical justice in school education is equal conditions for all in teaching textbooks and teachers,"Equity in school mathematics education ideally means providing students with the opportunity to realize their potential through the provision of public responsibility for the means to achieve ""Mathematical Maturity"" in full and in detail. To gain an understanding of the nuances of this concept, it is enough to delve into just one topic of elementary school mathematics curriculum. Select an arbitrarily unit segment, build two segments with lengths of ordinary fractions with different denominators and make sure that it is impossible to compare them in length in numerical terms. Then, appreciate the remarkable ability of Mathematics, to provide a solution to what would otherwise appear to be an insoluble problem. 

In the educational process, it is essential to differentiate between the state and the student. The first provides the opportunity to obtain knowledge, but is not to answer for the second. However, there must be moral and material motivation to obtain high-quality knowledge. In his teachings, wise Abay cautioned that the word from the educated though demanding, can illuminate the path to understanding. He urged to perceive the light and mystery that surrounds us. With his words ""Aitshy-aytshyp zhalynar, Uqqysh zhansyp shabynar. Uqpay zhatyp zhalyǵar, uıqyly-oıaý boıkúıez"", which translates as ‘mindless boredom, drowsiness’, he emphasised the importance of remaining alert and awake to the world around us. In the absence of boredom, sleepiness"", as in the case of personal transformation of the individual and the principle of ""you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink"". 

The concept of ""Justice"" is a multifaceted topic in the International Educational Space. It is the universal division between ""Global North"" and the ""Global South"", where the former has a stronger economy, infrastructure and technology, while the latter is characterized by less diverse economy, by poverty and inequality and a history of colonization by the countries of the Global North. These studies adopt from various points of views: sociological, economic, pedagogical, legal and political, as well as various professional approaches such as ""Fair education from the standpoint of textbook quality"" or ""Development and implementation of programs that take into account the needs of different groups of students"", ""Evaluation of the effectiveness of pedagogical strategies aimed at eliminating educational inequality"", and ""The role of technology in providing access to education"", etc.

61d5b9a1c20e1272ece2adf8fcd36c033da93024,Machine Learning in Sustainable Agriculture: Systematic Review and Research Perspectives,"Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized resource management in agriculture by analyzing vast amounts of data and creating precise predictive models. Precision agriculture improves agricultural productivity and profitability while reducing costs and environmental impact. However, ML implementation faces challenges such as managing large volumes of data and adequate infrastructure. Despite significant advances in ML applications in sustainable agriculture, there is still a lack of deep and systematic understanding in several areas. Challenges include integrating data sources and adapting models to local conditions. This research aims to identify research trends and key players associated with ML use in sustainable agriculture. A systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA methodology by a bibliometric analysis to capture relevant studies from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The study analyzed the ML literature in sustainable agriculture between 2007 and 2025, identifying 124 articles that meet the criteria for certainty assessment. The findings show a quadratic polynomial growth in the publication of articles on ML in sustainable agriculture, with a notable increase of up to 91% per year. The most productive years were 2024, 2022, and 2023, demonstrating a growing interest in the field. The study highlights the importance of integrating data from multiple sources for improved decision making, soil health monitoring, and understanding the interaction between climate, topography, and soil properties with agricultural land use and crop patterns. Furthermore, ML in sustainable agriculture has evolved from understanding weather data to integrating advanced technologies like the Internet of Things, remote sensing, and smart farming. Finally, the research agenda highlights the need for the deepening and expansion of predominant concepts, such as deep learning and smart farming, to develop more detailed and specialized studies and explore new applications to maximize the benefits of ML in agricultural sustainability.",Agriculture,2025.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/agriculture15040377?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture15040377, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

173805eb27375ed2e59949ae434bb04bceaed41f,"Exploring the World of Robot-Assisted Digital Storytelling: Trends, Models, and Educational Implications","Aim/Purpose: This paper explores the trends in robot storytelling, its conceptual models, and educational implications.

Background: Digital storytelling is the use of digital media elements such as text, images, audio, and video to create and tell a story. A form of digital storytelling using a social robot to do the story presentation is called robot-assisted digital storytelling or simply robot storytelling. A robot storytelling conceptual model is a visual representation of the process of creating and presenting robot stories. The model displays the main elements and their relationship, providing guidelines for creating and sharing the robot story. 

Methodology: This paper uses the scoping review method that follows the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) and the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley to review 30 publications selected from the period 01/01/2003 to 06/02/2024. The study first retrieved 235 publications from Scopus, Web of Science, and Lens databases based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The retrieved articles were screened, and 30 were selected for the review. The charting of the selected articles was carried out using content analysis on the following characteristics: author(s)/year, title of study, purpose of study, conceptual model/theoretical/methodological framework used, population, intervention/study activity, usage of intervention and finding/outcome. 

Contribution: The paper contributes to knowledge by revealing the trend in robot storytelling, its impacts on education, and the limitation or gap in robot storytelling conceptual models.

Findings: The paper found that robot storytelling is mainly used as a tool to impart knowledge to pupils and students in educational institutions. In addition, robot storytelling has a positive impact on teaching and learning at all levels of the educational ladder. Also, the number of published research studies on robot-assisted storytelling conceptual models is woefully inadequate.

Recommendations for Practitioners: This paper recommends that practitioners, especially the instructional delivery fraternity who use other digital storytelling presentation methods, such as computer and online storytelling, must resort to robot storytelling. This is because robot storytelling has proved to improve learning outcomes compared to other digital storytelling methods.

Recommendation for Researchers: This paper recommends that researchers in the field of robot storytelling endeavor to propose and publish more conceptual models for practitioners who want to develop robot storytelling. In addition to the conceptual models, detailed methodological frameworks can be developed for the models to make it easier for practitioners to develop robot storytelling.

Impact on Society: Robot storytelling is more attractive and sustains audience attention, therefore improving learning outcomes. This paper reveals to teaching professionals the current growing method of imparting knowledge to learners that uses robot storytelling. This paper also motivates managers of educational institutions to plan toward the use of social robots in instructional delivery.

Future Research: The paper proposes the development of a robot storytelling conceptual model that provides complete guidance from requirement analysis, story preparation, programming, testing, and presentation to evaluation to help practitioners. In addition, a detailed methodological framework based on the model should be developed to make it easier for users of the model.

ee8ba109e94ba4b7b44cf22e1c16e08200a9473e,Evaluating new technologies and organizational structures,"Welcome to the last issue of IASSIST Quarterly for 2024, IQ 48(4).
We are excited to share news of several developments that we have been working on over the last few months:
The IASSIST Qualitative Social Science and Humanities Data Interest Group (QSSHDIG) is planning an IASSIST Quarterly special issue dedicated to the complexities of sharing qualitative data. For this special issue, we invite submissions of abstract proposals focused on the ethical challenges, methodological concerns, and labor involved in making qualitative data and research materials publicly available. The full CfP and details on how to submit an abstract can be viewed on the IASSIST Quarterly website: https://iassistquarterly.com/index.php/iassist/announcement/view/7 .  The deadline for proposing articles is January 31st (full articles won’t be needed until later).
We are delighted to welcome Minglu Wang as a new IQ Editorial Board member (as of October 2024). Minglu is the Research Data Management Librarian in the Open Scholarship Department at York University Libraries, York, Ontario, Canada. Among other qualifications, she brings experience as a member of the Editorial Board for ACRL’s College & Research Libraries (C&RL) (2019–2025), and she led the project group for that Board to investigate a data policy for C&RL.
A new feature recently enabled on the OJS platform allows reviewers to link their profile with their ORCID iD. We mentioned last time that this will enable auto-loading of your articles to your ORCID profile, but the other effect is that it provides an opportunity for reviewers to receive credit and be acknowledged for their professional contributions. Note that the credit will merely note that you have served as a reviewer for the IQ—it will not indicate which article(s) you reviewed.
Unfortunately, the IQ editorial team had to retract a paper from publication this fall due to plagiarism. The paper titled “Data protection and right to privacy legislation in Kenya” by Mankone, A. M. (2023), was published in IQ, 47(3-4). The full retraction notice can be found here. 
This new issue of IQ 48(4) presents four excellent papers. The first two evaluate methods to enhance findability of data deposited in data repositories. The subsequent two papers focus on organizational structure and improving organizational workflows.
Kokila Jamwal in ”Boosting data findability: The role of AI-enhanced keyword” examines the use of Artificial Intelligece (AI) to supplement keywords that may be missing or inaccurately defined as a method to improve metadata and boost data findability. The author suggests that using this relatively new technology may reduce the time and effort required by data repositories staff for data curation and may enhance data findability and usability.
Co-authors Knut Wenig and Xiaoyao Han are examining the findability of data deposited in data repositories that are using DDI metadata standards. Their paper ”State of DDI Cloud” invetigates the availability and the comprehensive element usage of DDI standards across 29 repositories registered on re3data.org. Based on their findings they provide recommendations for various stakeholders including the repositories, Dataverse developers, re3data.org, and the DDI Alliance.
The article ”The IPUMS Business Process Model: Instituting a workflow mapping strategy to support archival processes” introduces the IPUMS workflow from external submission of data, harmonization process, documentation, extraction systems, and archival preservation of metadata. Author Diana Magnuson explains the value of instituting this mapping approach, and demonstrates the power of a clear business process model for developing archival goals in an organizational setting in which the archive function is vital but secondary to the main product.
In ”Understanding motivations and future needs for data depoists at Korea Social Sciences Data Archive”, authors Hyowon Kim, Do Won Kim and Jungwon Yang evaluate the current data deposit process of the Korea Social Science Data Archive (KOSSDA). The data archive recently transitioned into an idependent researh center under Seoul National Univerity. Using interviews with stakeholders, they identify future needs and suggest a long-term strategy to ensure that the archive meets the needs of the academic community it supports.
 
Wishing you a happy holidays season, and peace, health, and happiness in the New Year.

b4210b0308d83ff45eab9b4d740c46169c255306,ICT-Based Game: An Alternative to Promote Healthy Eating in Ecuadorian Children Using User-Centred Design,"Inadequate nutrition in Ecuadorian children leads to various physical, cognitive, and biological issues. However, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) has become established in raising awareness and promoting beneficial eating behaviours. This research, conducted at the Indo-America Educational Unit during the 2022-2023 academic year in Ambato, Ecuador, aimed to compare the effectiveness of a guide text versus a didactic game in enhancing knowledge about healthy eating among fifth-grade students in Natural Sciences. The study involved 87 fifth-grade students, divided into two groups: Group 1, consisting of 42 students, and Group 2, consisting of 45 students. The teacher of Group 1 used traditional methods (reading and writing from the text), while the teacher of Group 2 employed a game called Flavour Puzzle. Statistical analysis revealed significant improvements in knowledge and motivation for students using the game-based method. Specifically, students in Group 2 showed a 26% greater improvement in knowledge levels compared to those in Group 1, and their motivation levels were nearly three times higher (89% vs. 30%). The results indicate that the game-based method has a clear comparative advantage over traditional text-based instruction, as it not only facilitated teaching but also enhanced socialization and engagement among students. Technological resources like Flavour Puzzle are more engaging for students and should be utilized as both recreational and educational tools in teaching Natural Sciences at the school level.

f30f925844487b38147c53e7454ac37f61326287,Post Operative Outcome of Desarda Technique Versus Lichtenstein Mesh Hernioplasty for Inguinal Hernia Repair,"Background: Current inguinal hernia operations are generally based on anatomical considerations. Failures of such operations to some extents are due to lack of consideration of physiological aspects. Many patients with inguinal hernia are cured because of current techniques of operation, though factors that are said to prevent hernia formation are not restored. Therefore, the surgical physiology of inguinal canal needs to be reconsidered. In the year 2001, Mohan P Desarda first described a physiological repair technique of inguinal hernia, which is practiced in many centers with significantly positive outcome. To evaluate the post-operative outcome of Desarda technique versus Lichtenstein mesh hernioplasty in inguinal hernia repair, this research has performed.
Materials and methods: This Quasi experimental study was carried out in Surgery Department of Chittagong Medical College Hospital, during December 2017 to January 2019. A total of 100 patients with inguinal hernia underwent surgery were included in this study. Samples were selected by convenient technique. Among them 50 patients were selected for Desarda Technique was considered as group I and the rest 50 patients were selected for Lichtenstein Mesh Hernioplasty was considered as group II. Statistical analysis of the results was obtained by using window-based computer software devised with Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS-22).
Results: The proposed sample size was 50 in each group. The study group included male patient above 18 years of age undergoing Desarda Technique and Lichtenstein Mesh Hernioplasty for inguinal hernia repair. The mean age was 43.14±14.44 years in group I and 48.33±12.63 years in group II. Indirect hernia was found 37(74.0%) and 28(56.0%) in group I and group II respectively. The mean 3rd POD pain (NPRS) was 4.44±0.97 in group I and 5.52±0.71 in group II. The mean 10th POD pain Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) was 0.76±1.02 in group I and 2.62±1.21 in group II. The mean 1 month pain (NPRS) was 0.08±0.27 in group I and 0.72±0.7 in group II. The mean 3rd month pain (NPRS) was 0.02±0.14 in group I and 0.34±0.48 in group II. The mean 6th month pain (NPRS) was 0±0 in group I and 0.2±0.45 in group II. Pain (NPRS) was significantly (p<0.05) higher in group II in 3rd POD and all subsequent follow-up. Seroma was found 5(10.0%) at 10th POD in group I and 5(10.0%) in group II. The difference was statistically not significant (p>0.05) between two groups. Wound infection found 2(4.0%) in 3rd POD in group Iand 5(10.0%) in group II. Wound infection didn’t develop in subsequent follow-up in group I but in group II, 1(2.0%) found in 10th POD, 1(2.0%) in 1 month, 1(2.0%) in 3rd month, 1(2.0%) in 6th month. The difference was not significant (p>0.05) between two groups. Recurrence was not observed in either group during this study period.
Conclusion: Desarda technique of inguinal hernia repair in our set up is useful with comparable results to Lichtenstein hernioplasty.

Abstract: The escalating global food waste crisis poses significant environmental challenges and resource losses, with approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption wasted each year. This review explores the innovative conversion of food waste into bioenergy by highlighting various technologies such as hydrothermal conversion, gasification coupled with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, bio-electrochemical, and synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. These methods help to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions associated with food waste disposal and also provide renewable energy alternatives that can help reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Recent advancements in these technologies have demonstrated improved efficiency, greater feedstock flexibility, and enhanced economic viability, making food waste essential in the pursuit of a circular bioeconomy. This review emphasizes the importance of matching and screening different types of food waste for energy conversion, which is crucial for optimizing resource recovery and maximizing energy output. By examining the latest developments in food waste-to-bioenergy technologies, this review also aims to underscore the potential of food waste as a valuable resource and contribute to sustainable waste management and energy security efforts. The transformative potential of food waste conversion technologies in addressing the pressing global food waste crisis were evaluated. Adopting these methods promotes a circular bioeconomy where waste is valued as a resource, not a burden. The integration of these technologies into existing food waste management systems will be crucial for achieving energy security, mitigating environmental impacts, and promoting sustainable resource utilization. As we face the challenges of food waste, these solutions may represent a critical pathway toward a more sustainable future.",Green Energy and Fuel Research,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.53941/gefr.2025.100004?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.53941/gefr.2025.100004, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5b12e7f1ddae99cea3d810493544d33b112febc4,Exploring Health Educational Interventions for Children With Congenital Heart Disease: Scoping Review,"Background Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 40,000 births annually in the United States. Despite advances in medical care, CHD is often a chronic condition requiring continuous management and education. Effective care management depends on children’s understanding of their condition. This highlights the need for targeted health educational interventions to enhance health literacy among children with CHD. Objective This scoping review aims to map and explore existing health educational interventions for children with CHD. The review identifies the types of interventions, target populations, delivery methods, and assessed outcomes. The goal is to consolidate fragmented research, identify gaps, and establish future research agendas. Methods Comprehensive searches were conducted in February 2024 using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) framework across multiple databases: APA PsycINFO, MedlinePlus via Ovid, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and EBSCOhost (CINAHL Complete, CINAHL Ultimate, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and ERIC). The search covered health care, design, and human-computer interaction disciplines to capture the interdisciplinary nature of CHD health educational interventions. There was no predefined time limit due to the limited number of relevant studies. Eligible studies were in English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and focused on primary data about educational health interventions for children with CHD. We extracted and synthesized data using thematic analysis. Results The review identified 11 studies: 9 randomized controlled trials and 2 observational studies. These used 6 educational strategies: 3D patient-specific models (n=3), habit formation interventions (n=2), empowerment-based health education programs (n=2), rehabilitation interventions (n=2), web-based portals (n=1), and videotape presentations (n=1). Interventions ranged from brief outpatient sessions to 1.5-year programs, with follow-up from none to 24 months. Studies aimed to improve coping, self-management, and knowledge for children with CHD and their families. The most frequently used assessment method was the independent samples t test (n=4) for pre- and postassessments, and all 11 studies used questionnaires, 8 of which incorporated qualitative feedback. The target participants for these interventions were children aged 13 years and older (n=3), parents (n=2), and children of various ages and their parents (n=6). Outcomes included improved children’s health literacy, reduced parental burden, and increased health care provider efficiency. Conclusions This review underscores the critical need for tailored educational interventions for children with CHD. Current research mainly focuses on adolescents and relies heavily on parental involvement, possibly overlooking the specific needs of younger children younger than 13 years of age. It is essential to develop engaging, age-appropriate interventions that actively involve children with CHD in their health care journey. Effective health educational interventions are crucial in empowering these young patients and improving their long-term health outcomes.",JMIR Pediatrics and Parenting,2024.0,4,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11806270, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5be5c8744e855c6125f616370a5f925c4dba7a15,Rapid Surge of Chikungunya in Pakistan Demands Urgent Action,"Chikungunya virus infection is a vector-borne disease that has emerged as a serious public health concern around the world over the past two decades. The disease is associated with a significant morbidity rate with an increased risk of lifelong impairment along with psychological and economic consequences.  Although severe complications are uncommon, chikungunya virus disease (CHIKVD) causes debilitating and persistent joint pain, neurological symptoms, inflammation in the heart muscle, liver damage as well as multiple organ failure in severe cases, which can be life threatening mostly in infants and elderly population.1  The first Chikungunya vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023 is currently licensed in the United States, however, there is no vaccine available in the endemic countries.2 
CHIKV was first identified in Pakistan in 1983 to be circulating in rodents with a limited number of human infections. Since 2015, outbreaks of CHIKV in human population have become more frequent primarily during dengue epidemics.3 The local transmission was confirmed by February 28, 2016 and according to National Institute of Health, Pakistan, a total of 8,521 laboratory confirmed cases were reported from December 2016 till March 2018, with Sindh and Balochistan accounting for the majority of reported cases.4 According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, as of November 30 2024, around 480,000 cases of CHIKVD have been reported worldwide, with over 200 deaths in 2024. Pakistan is among the 23 countries reporting the CHIKVD with approximately 5,726 cases confirmed during the latest outbreak in 2024.5 
Pakistan being a subtropical country, is becoming more vulnerable to the transmission of chikungunya and other vector-borne diseases including dengue, malaria and leishmaniasis due to changes in the climate patterns such as longer summers, shorter milder winters, and an increased frequency of unpredictable and severe weather events. The CHIKVD appears to have overlapping symptoms (fever and severe joint pains) with other viral illnesses such as dengue, which often leads to misdiagnosis resulting in the mistreatment of both illnesses causing serious challenges for healthcare professionals. In addition, an underestimated disease burden is reported. The mosquito vectors responsible for Chikungunya virus transmission are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, species prevalent in Pakistan during and after the monsoon season and the same species also transmit dengue and Zika viruses.6 All of these factors including the upcoming monsoons are likely to contribute to the endemicity of the CHIKVD in Pakistan over the coming year. 
In Pakistan, the overall impact of the CHIKVD is multifaceted with ambiguous consequences due to an underestimated disease burden. The increasing prevalence associated with Chikungunya alongside other vector-borne infections underscores an urgent need for further scientific exploration and public health interventions to alleviate the effects of this emerging infectious 
disease. The impact of Chikungunya on human health can be overwhelming, particularly in countries like Pakistan already burdened by dengue and malaria outbreaks. This emphasizes an immediate and rigorous strategy, including public health campaigns, to be prepared and implemented by the coordinated actions of various health departments including the Ministry of National Health Services Regulations and Coordination (NHSR&C), National Institute of Health (NIH) Pakistan, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and other related divisions.

56b7c7f66e036503ee53496c78b24aab0ff8ee08,СКРИНИНГОВОЕ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЕ ФИЗИЧЕСКОГО СОСТОЯНИЯ И КВАНТОВЫХ МУЛЬТИЭЛЕМЕНТОВ ДВИГАТЕЛЬНОЙ МОТОРИКИ ИНЖЕНЕРНОГО ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСКОГО КАПИТАЛА,"В статье отмечается, что высокие IT-технологии напрямую связаны с инженерией, поскольку компьютерный инжиниринг – это дисциплина, которая объединяет информатику и электронную инженерию. В России инженерное высшее образование или образование в области информационных технологий получает каждый третий студент вуза. На начало 2023/2024 учебного года общее число таких студентов превысило 1,3 млн. человек. Но «инженерный компонент», как понятие, трансформировался за рамки «специальности», и составляет смежный элемент сотен млн. ресурсов. В последние годы квантовая физика вышла за пределы лабораторий и стала осваиваться бизнесом и индустрией. Краткий анализ литературы. До распада СССР в Военном институте физической культуры инженерные разработки первоначально реализовывались в Военно-воздушных силах на базе Воронежского авиационного инженерного вуза. Так, М. М. Гамбургом в 1987 г. реализована диссертация на тему «Поэтапное построение физической подготовки курсантов авиационно-инженерного училища Военно-Воздушных Сил». В дальнейшем тему развили А. А. Юрченко (2000) и А. Л. Юрченко (2002). В. А. Липчанским (1992) разработана технология организации процесса физической подготовки инженеров-конструкторов. Цель: пролонгированное изучение содержания и структуры физического состояния и квантовых мультиэлементов двигательной моторики человеческого капитала на репрезентативной выборке инженерного контингента. Гипотеза исследования: предполагалось, что выявление наиболее устойчивых связей и свойств квантовых мультиэлементов двигательной моторики физического состояния инженерных специалистов позволит унифицировать целевую установку требований к процессу их кондиционной подготовки. Методологическим фундаментом исследований являлись концепты и теории: человеческого капитала (Т. Шульц, Г. Беккер, Э. Денисон, Р. Солоу, Дж. Кендрик, С. Кузнец, С. Фабрикант, И. Фишер, Р. Лукас); рефлекторная теория И. М. Сеченова; учение о высшей нервной деятельности (И. М. Сеченов, И. П. Павлов, П. К. Анохин); гипотеза о квантах (М. Планк); учение о ноосфере (В. И. Вернадский); теория квантового инженера (К. Лахманский). Основными методами научного изыскания представились: логической обработки и сжатия информации; тестирование; пролонгированный синтетический эксперимент; биометрия; моделирование; прогнозирование. Организация исследования. В пролонгации 1995–2024 гг. задействованы базы 20 инженерных частей, вузов видов и родов Вооруженных сил, Санкт-Петербургский университет промышленных технологий и дизайна, Тамбовский технический университет и АО «ЗАВКОМ» (завод «Комсомолец» имени Н. С. Артемова). Репрезентативность выборки составила 2770 чел. мужского пола возраста 34,82±1,6 лет. Редакции представлены акты реализации. Результатами на примере специалистов управления воздушным движением установлены пороги перекрёстной адаптации и сенсибилизации оптимальности, в том числе: скорость переработки мыслительной информации – среднее время одной реакции – от 1620 до 1700 мс; сложная сенсомоторная реакция – среднее латентное время – от 555 до 585 мс; среднее моторное время – от 250 до 275 мс;количество ошибок – не более двух. Предполагается тенденция трансформации дефиниции «инженер» в понятие «инженерия» на новой ступени иерархического толкования, по аналогии с терминами «форма», «прогресс». В отношении структурного образования, в отличие от физики и химического состава (конкретным зарядом атомного ядра и свойствами элементов), квантовая субстанция физического состояния инженера неоднородна, но проявляется меньшей вариативностью психофизиологических ошибок в тестах; превалированием (≈60%) вариативности респираторной системы; концентрацией ведущих мультиэлементов в кластерах «аэробной биоэнергетики», «кардиоваскулярной выносливости» с перераспределением в компоненты мембран клеток молекул триглицерида и эфиров холестерина в сторону лучших по продуктивности специалистов не в ущерб регрессии накопления внешнего (подкожного) жира и эффективности функций внешнего дыхания.
 The article notes that high IT technologies are directly related to engineering, since computer engineering is a discipline that combines computer science and electronic engineering. In Russia, every third university student receives higher engineering education or education in the field of information technology. At the beginning of the 2023/2024 academic year, the total number of such students exceeded 1,3 million people. But the ""engineering component"" as a concept has been transformed beyond the framework of the ""specialty"", and constitutes an adjacent element of hundreds of millions of resources. In recent years, quantum physics has moved beyond the lab and into business and industry. Краткий анализ литературы. Before the collapse of the USSR, engineering developments at the Military Institute of Physical Culture were initially implemented in the Air Force on the basis of the Voronezh Aviation Engineering University. Thus, in 1987, M. M. Hamburg implemented a dissertation on the topic ""Step-by-step construction of physical training of cadets of the Aviation Engineering School of the Air Force"". Later, the topic was developed by A. A. Yurchenko (2000) and A.L. Yurchenko (2002). V. A. Lipchansky (1992) developed a technology for organizing the process of physical training of design engineers. Purpose: Prolonged study of the content and structure of the physical state and quantum multielements of motor skills of human capital on a representative sample of the engineering contingent. Research hypothesis: It was assumed that the identification of the most stable connections and properties of quantum multielements of motor motor skills of the physical state of engineering specialists would make it possible to unify the target setting of requirements for the process of their conditioning training. The methodological foundation of the research was concepts and theories: human capital (T. Schultz, G. Becker, E. Denison, R. Solow, J. Kendrick, S. Kuznets, S. Fabrikant, I. Fisher, R. Lucas); I. M. Sechenov's reflex theory; the doctrine of higher nervous activity (I. M. Sechenov, I. P. Pavlov, P. K. Anokhin); the hypothesis of quanta (M. Planck); the doctrine of the noosphere (V. I. Vernadsky); Quantum Engineer's Theory (K. Lachmansky). The main methods of scientific research were: logical processing and compression of information; testing; prolonged synthetic experiment; biometrics; simulation; forecasting. Study organization. The 1995–2024 extension involves the bases of 20 engineering units, universities of the branches and branches of the Armed Forces, the St. Petersburg University of Industrial Technologies and Design, Tambov Technical University and ZAVKOM JSC (Komsomolets plant named after N. S. Artyomov). The representativeness of the sample was 2770 people Male age 34.82±1.6 years. The editorial office is presented with the acts of implementation. The results on the example of air traffic control specialists established the thresholds of cross-adaptation and sensitization of optimality, including: the speed of processing mental information – the average time of one reaction – is from 1620 to 1700 ms; complex sensorimotor response – average latency time – from 555 to 585 ms; Average motor time – 250 to 275 ms; the number of errors is no more than two. Conclusions and conclusion. It is assumed that the definition of ""engineer"" will be transformed into the concept of ""engineering"" at a new level of hierarchical interpretation, by analogy with the terms ""form"" and ""progress"". In relation to structural formation, in contrast to physics and chemical composition (the specific charge of the atomic nucleus and the properties of the elements), the quantum substance of the physical state of an engineer is heterogeneous, but is manifested by less variability of psychophysiological errors in tests; prevalence (≈60%) of respiratory system variability; concentration of the leading multielements in the clusters of ""aerobic bioenergetics"", ""cardiovascular endurance"" with the redistribution of triglyceride molecules and cholesterol esters into the components of cell membranes towards the best specialists in terms of productivity, without prejudice to the regression of external (subcutaneous) fat accumulation and the efficiency of external respiration functions.",Человеческий капитал,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.25629/hc.2024.10.22?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.25629/hc.2024.10.22, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

aa90d99431f96b5f0b2c035fbb2c80496c2d46f2,Artificial Intelligence in the Legal Field: Law Students Perspective,"The Artificial Intelligence field, or AI, experienced a renaissance in the last few years across various fields such as law, medicine, and finance. While there are studies outlining the landscape of AI in the legal field as well as surveys of the current AI efforts of law firms, to our knowledge there has not been an investigation of the intersection of law students and AI. Such research is critical to help ensure current law students are positioned to fully exploit this technology as they embark on their legal careers but to also assist existing legal firms to better leverage their AI skillset both operationally and in helping to formulate future legal frameworks for regulating this technology across industries. The study presented in this paper addresses this gap. Through a survey conducted from July 22 to Aug 19, 2024, the study covers the law students background, AI usage, AI applications in the legal field, AI regulations and open-ended comments to share opinions. The results from this study show the uniqueness of law students as a distinct cohort. The results differ from the ones of established law firms especially in AI engagement - established legal professionals are more engaged than law students. Somewhat surprising, the law firm participants show higher enthusiasm about AI than this student cohort. Collaborations with Computer Science departments would further enhance the AI knowledge and experience of law students in AI technologies such as prompt engineering (zero and few shot), chain-of-thought prompting, and language model hallucination management. As future work, we would like to expand the study to include more variables and a larger cohort more evenly distributed across locales. In addition, it would be insightful to repeat the study with the current cohort in one year to track how the students viewpoints evolve.",arXiv.org,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09937, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The purpose of this study is to develop various strategies to answer these needs both in increasing the number of entrepreneurs and workers in accordance with the needs of the business world, the industrial world and the world of work, especially in the tourism sector. This study uses a qualitative research approach where qualitative research as a scientific method is often used and implemented by a group of researchers in the field of social sciences, including education. The results obtained after conducting research in two interview quotes delivered by two informants from the Lake Toba Authority Implementing Agency, it can be said that the need for workers in the tourism sector in 8 Regencies Around Lake Toba is currently still high. However, to support the two statements above, a projection will be calculated based on four tourism business samples, namely, star hotels, non-star hotels, restaurants/eateries and Travel. Based on arithmetic calculations, the number of workers in the next five (5) years can be projected. In 2023 the number of workers in travel is estimated at 722 people. In 2024 it will increase to 766 people. In 2025, there were 827 people. In 2026, it increased to 902 people and in 2027, it increased to 1,010 people.

Purpose In this paper, we examine the history of the CS4All initiative and document the network of actors and their relationships in the system such that we can understand how this reform is enacted, how it might be reactive to external contexts and pressures, and how the structure and pathways of this particular social network might inform similar efforts elsewhere. Research Design To structure our analysis of CS4All, we first examine the most recent historic example of a large-scale curricular reform—Man: A Course of Study (MACOS). By reflecting on the network structure of CS4All in light of the design, enactment, and eventual failure of MACOS, we can identify potential pain points and opportunities in CS4All's 10-year effort. We conducted interviews with core members of the CS4All initiative and examined available public records to construct and analyze a social network of key CS4All stakeholders, other actors, processes, and institutions. Conclusions In our analysis of the CS4All social network, we document how well-connected individuals simultaneously mobilized government resources and grassroots enthusiasm to create the conditions necessary for the initiation of this massive curricular reform effort, and describe the current pathways in place for decision making and resource distribution. Comparing the history and structure of the CS4All initiative to Man: A Course of Study —a failed nationwide curricular reform in the 1960s—we find that CS4All's centralized decision-making process and failure to create and distribute high quality formative assessment tools may lead to challenges to adoption. However, explicit efforts to solicit input from and communicate initiative values to the large diversity of stakeholders throughout NYC, as well as the innovation of a decentralized “buffet-style” curricular approach, may put CS4All on more sure footing.",Teachers College Record,2020.0,1,"{'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146812012201106', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/016146812012201106?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/016146812012201106, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

44a798982b1d1de1471fc048e3a2447eeea93116,Student Attitudes During the Pilot of the Computer Science Frontiers Course,"Motivation. We have created a modular project-based learning curriculum, Computer Science Frontiers (CSF) [1, 8], for secondary students in attempts to increase the persistence of computer science (CS) students in higher education. The CSF course is divided into four different modules (Distributed Computing, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering), each centered around a topic typically introduced to students only in higher education. Using the block-based programming environment NetsBlox [4], students are able to access various Application Programming Interfaces related to their interests [2, 3]. The goal of this course is to increase student interest in CS during high school - when first career choices occur [7] - in hopes they will persist in CS during their undergraduate studies. Research question. The research question for this study was: How does the Computer Science Frontiers course affect student attitudes towards computer science? Research Methods. We conducted over 20 interviews with students throughout a CSF pilot course that took place over the 2022-2023 school year. Interviews were conducted with at least five students at the end of every module. Two researchers have conducted thematic analysis with student responses from the first two modules [5]: Distributed Computing (DC) and Internet of Things (IoT). First, the two researchers developed a norm by tagging one interview together [6]. Next, the researchers independently coded the rest of the interviews for each module. After completing a single module’s interviews, the researchers met to rectify any discrepancies. Finally, the tags were grouped together based on common themes. Through this process, we found a total of seven themes. Results. The themes found through thematic analysis include: computer science, attitudes towards course, student wants, student struggles, attitudes towards projects, collaboration, and student progression. As a result of this study, we have identified different needs for secondary students with varying background in CS when studying more advanced CS topics, such as IoT. For example, a need of students who have less prior CS knowledge than others may be to review programming concepts in order to be successful in the course. We have also identified a positive change in student’s attitudes towards computer science after the first two modules. These insights provide the CS education community with ways to engage students with concepts that they have not been exposed to and how to increase their interest in CS. Implications. The CSF curriculum is currently online, and is available to computer science instructors. Each module is separated into eight to nine units which are accompanied by activities and teaching guides. This curriculum provides educators with materials and activities to introduce students to more advanced CS topics, either through individual modules or as an entire course. In future research, we plan to use CSF in an outreach program and implement the course in two secondary classrooms in the 2023-2024 school year.",International Computing Education Research Workshop,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3568812.3603483?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3568812.3603483, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

cea0211c18f844a600a696e080fc4c4d1cee88a8,Motivational Factors Affecting Computer Science Enrollment,"Internationally, the interest in science, technology, engineering, and math, or STEM, has led many countries to enact education policies aimed at generating more attention to STEM careers among its primary and secondary students. Driven by the supposed need for more STEM field workers, the movement has perhaps failed to look closely at what it is that drives the need and where the actual needs lie. Within the STEM career field lies jobs from nurse to field biologist to civil engineer to computer programmer [7]. However, there is also a large demand for computer science, field that is often swallowed up by the larger STEM interest. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics [2], computing jobs will make up 66% of all science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) jobs between 2014-2024 in the United States. However, only 8.48% of college STEM majors are in the computer science (CS) field [2] and there are over 500,000 unfilled computing jobs in the United States alone, but less than 50,000 CS graduates [3]. With the documented need for more CS workers, matched with very little primary and secondary CS education research and slow movements to enact policy, we have reached a critical point where it is important to understand more about what factors motivate students to enter the CS career field and how educators can use these factors to help direct and support more students to fill the important job sector that so desperately needs skilled employees. Using the expectancy-value theory (EVT) as a framework, this poster presents a study that looks at factors that could serve as predictors for enrollment in high school CS electives. EVT posits that individuals who are given options, particularly around course and career choices, make their decision based on how they expect to perform at the task and what value they see it having in their life. Value can be further broken into utility value, intrinsic value, attainment value, and cost [4, 5, 9]. This framework for understanding student motivations for STEM has been used and validated multiple times [1, 6, 8], so this study hopes to build on that proven reliability to understand student motivations with regard to CS. Using the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:2009) This poster presents a work-in-progress that looks at what factors during the ninth grade (first year secondary) year are predictors of a student's enrollment in any CS course during high school.",Conference on Global Computing Education,2019.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3300115.3312510?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3300115.3312510, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Meanwhile, the number of international graduate students attending U.S. universities in 2014 reached 329,854 representing 37% of all international students in the country (IIE, 2014), and continued to increase through fall 2010, with all of the increase occurring in Science and Engineering (SE in 2011, foreign students earned 56% of doctorates in engineering, 51% in computer science, and 44% in physics (National Science Board, 2014).As described in Allum's (2014) report based on the annual Survey of Graduate Enrollment and Degrees, in the fall of 2013, 56.2% of all foreign graduate students were in engineering, mathematics and computer science, physical and earth sciences, or biological and agricultural sciences. Meanwhile, only 17.6% of U.S. citizen and permanent resident graduate students were enrolled in these fields. This trend has continued unabated showing that the United States receives a considerable number of international graduate students, who are preferentially enrolled in SE National Academy of Sciences, 2006). The growing demand for scientists and engineers is a worldwide phenomenon and many developed countries that cannot meet this increased demand locally, recruit international students and foreign-born highly educated workers who are likely to bring a significant contribution to the higher education system and workplaces. Despite the magnitude of the international SE Mori, 2000). By gaining an understanding of these issues, American higher education institutions could proactively formulate appropriate policies and programs that would benefit international students and in long term would contribute to recruit, train, and retain talented specialists in science and engineering fields.This paper examines the relationship between post-graduation plans and the graduate school experiences of S&E doctoral students when controlling for demographic factors (age, sex), culture-specific characteristics (race/ethnicity as a proxy for region of origin), field of study, and English language proficiency. …",,2017.0,16,"{'url': 'http://ojed.org/index.php/jis/article/download/242/186', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32674/JIS.V7I1.242?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32674/JIS.V7I1.242, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

84189729a13049d608c101869043101d20690763,Petroleum++: SPE’s Uses of Artificial Intelligence and Board Meeting Update,"In this month’s column, I will share news on the recent SPE Board of Directors meeting in Saudi Arabia and SPE’s utilization of artificial intelligence (AI).
 The first of the Board’s quarterly meetings of the year is usually held virtually where several administrative items are discussed and the nomination process for the new Board members gets started. The last meeting of the year is held in conjunction with the SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition (ATCE). The middle two meetings are usually held in areas with significant industry operations that gives the Board an opportunity to meet the leaders of SPE sections and regions. The spring 2023 meeting was held for the first time in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
 Below are some of the key decisions reached at the meeting.
 - Approved the nominating committee’s recommendations for the 2025 SPE President—Olivier Houzé; Data Science and Engineering Analytics Technical Director—Sushma Bhan; Asia Pacific Regional Director—Hazli Sham Kassim; Europe Regional Director—Pierre Emmanuel d’Huart; Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Director—Carlos Alberto Pedroso; North American Regional Director—Kim Oracheski; and the Russia and Caspian Regional Director—Alexey Borisenko. More information about these volunteers was published in the April JPT.
 - Approved the budget for SPE’s fiscal year 2024, which runs from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.
 - Reviewed the activities for selling the building in Richardson, Texas.
 - Updated the process for countries/sections that wish to be considered for an exception to the membership dues.
 - Removed the requirement for students to provide a full technical paper for participation in the Regional Student Paper Contest.
 - Approved SPE CCUS International Conference and Exhibition, October 2023, in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia.
 - Formed a work group to develop a long-term plan for SPE’s flagship event, ATCE.
 - Approved SPE policy on AI-generated content in publications (details on the policy are available here).
 - Updated the Charitable Contribution Policy when SPE donates to areas where our members are affected by natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes.
 In conjunction with the meeting in Dhahran, Board members attended the monthly meeting of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Section, with about 500 members, to discuss local and Society-level activities. Saudi Aramco arranged for the Board to visit the Shaybah field operations and the natural wildlife sanctuary in the Rub’ al-Khali, or Empty Quarter.
 It is interesting how the challenges of operating a large oilfield facility in a remote area like the Empty Quarter are like what I used to see with operations of the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk fields in the North Slope of Alaska. It is telling the extent of what we do to provide the world with energy it needs when at airports like in Anchorage next to the counters of United, American, and Alaska Airlines, there were counters for ARCO, BP, and ExxonMobil.
 The next Board meeting in July 2023 will be held in Kuala Lumpur.

0b41320a4cd2beb4159bb36f6dffff31f4787034,Regulatory Science Challenges : Encouraging Innovation Through an Adaptive Regulatory System,"ATMPs - a new era A boy from Hungary, Zente, was one and a half years old when the crowd-funding campaign to finance his life-saving medicine Zolgensma concluded with a happy end. He was the third European patient that received the new gene therapy, which replaces the function of the missing or nonworking survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene with a new, working copy of a human SMN gene that helps motor neuron cells work properly and survive. From a European perspective, it has been almost 15 years by now since regulatory framework for advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) had been established to ensure the free movement of these medicines within the European Union, to facilitate their access to the EU market, and to foster the competitiveness of European pharmaceutical companies in the field. Zolgensma has been approved in the EU in May 2020. The FDA expects it will be reviewing and approving up to 20 cell and gene therapies each year until 2025. Rapid development of technology and better understanding of the manufacturing challenges are not the only prerequisites of the growth. Assessment of products like Zolgensma requires very specific knowledge and often an adaptive approach from regulators. They have to gain enough experience and need to be able to summarize knowledge in guidelines that would help developers of products that are substantially different from traditional medicines. FDA issued seven new guidelines in January 2020, in which, for example, they highlight the importance of long-term follow-up for gene therapies that offer one-time fix for inherited diseases and where pre-market studies may have limited value. 2. Regulatory tools These examples may already show that rapid change in technology leads to new kinds of medicines that require a properly adapted regulatory system. Patients would expect state-of-the-art medicines within the shortest possible time frame, however, authorities are traditionally more cautious. Still, there are several various initiatives from the EMA and the FDA to foster early access to medicines. Some of these have been available for a longer time. EMA's accelerated assessment reduces the timeframe for review of innovative applications of medicines with major public health interest. Conditional marketing authorisation grants authorization before a complete dataset is available, and compassionate use allows the use of an unauthorized medicine for patients with an unmet medical need. A more recent regulatory tool of EMA is the priority medicines scheme (PRIME) that aims to enhance support for the development of medicines that are expected to make a real difference to patients. Early dialogue between EMA and the developers is a crucial part of the tool, together with accelerated assessment and continuous scientific advice and protocol assistance. Up to now, 282 applications for PRIME eligibility have been assessed by the CHMP of which 95 have received a green light. Most of the applicants are small and medium size enterprises, and the major therapeutic area is oncology. FDA has similar programs, such as the Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review designations, and is also aiming to facilitate and accelerate development and marketing authorization of key medicines. By 2018, about 70% of new drug approvals by the FDA were expedited, compared to about 50% in 2010. The result is a growing pro-portion of medicines authorized with less premarket evidence, a trade-off, that most patients with fatal or debilitating disease would likely accept. Nevertheless, conditional approval requires a strong post-marketing attention from regulators, and lack of enough evidence sometimes leads to difficult decisions. In April 2019 a fast-tracked cancer drug, Lartruvo was withdrawn because a large study was not able to prove a favourable benefit-risk profile, which was established previously on a smaller patient population. The regulators approach is not expected to be changed, but experience from such cases would gradually be built into the decision-making process. In addition to this real world evidence (RWE) and patient recorded outcomes may also help in decision making. 3. Digital revolution The rapid development of biotechnology is not the only area where an adaptive regulatory approach is needed. Digital medicine is a new field, as smartphones and sensors open up new ways of generating data. For example, collecting and analysing RWE seems to be a good solution for single arm studies where randomized trials are not feasible. FDA has approved easy-to-use devices that are able to track several physiological systems of our body, which in turn can give a boost to developments in this field. In addition to these simpler devices, digital revolution in terms of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive machine learning is another challenge that our regulatory systems should tackle. It has been recently announced that a new drug candidate, a long-acting and potent serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist, which was created using an artificial intelligence platform, will enter into clinical study. There are also numerous radiological applications based on AI, including computer aideddetection and diagnosis software, where images are analysed, and clinically relevant findings suggested to aid diagnostic decisions. Many of these new developments require a tailored approach from regulators to find a way for authorization within the existing regulatory framework. The fact, that many of these new developments are carried out by academic research groups or small companies without extensive regulatory experience, adds an extra layer of difficulty. To meet this challenge, EMA and the Heads of Medicines Agencies have established the EU-Innovation Network, to support medicine innovation and early development. As a milestone of its function, beginning in 1 February 2020 a pilot for simultaneous scientific advice is starting, where the applicants will receive a consolidated advice from the participating agencies. Innovative products often require specific expertise;therefore this new form of advice is also extremely beneficial for regulators as they are able to learn from each other and broaden their knowledge. 4. Conclusions The rapid development of pharmaceutical and digital technology requires a concerted action from all stakeholders. Or, as we all experience, a global pandemic can be an important driving force of the evolution of regulatory policies. Appropriate usage of currently available regulatory tools and a continuous discussion between academia, industry and regulators would be the only way to ensure quick access to state-of-the-art, safe and efficacious medicines, and medical devices. It is clearly shown currently by the concerted action of various stakeholders and series of rolling reviews which led to the expedited authorization of COVID-19 vaccines.",Acta pharmaceutica Hungarica,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.aph-hsps.hu/acta/index.php/aph/article/download/59/45', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33892/aph.2021.91.106-107?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33892/aph.2021.91.106-107, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6e704f9894a91591665b661954c28f0b5bcfd4c4,Student Retention and Success in an RN-BSN Program: Determining Variables and Methods,"Background The Online Registered Nurse to Baccalaureate Science in Nursing (RN- BSN) Program has a retention rate of close to 97.5% (UTEP, 2020). Attrition rates in nursing programs are high. The National League for Nursing (NLN) last reported a 25 % attrition rate which may double for minority students in four-year nursing programs (NLN, 2014; Elkin, 2019). As online courses in colleges and universities are growing and are predicted to become mainstream by 2025, it is essential to identify factors contributing to our retention rates. American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) has made it part of its 2021-2022 policy priorities to increase access to nursing programs (AACN, 2021). Objective The purpose of this study was to ascertain the factors affecting nursing student retention. The information was used to make changes to the existing online programs in our school and better support our students. The research question was “What factors do students identify that influenced their RN to BSN program retention?” Methodology The participants were chosen using a convenience sampling technique. The university was a public institution located in a border town. Three types of questions were asked: (1) general demographic information, (2) nursing career, and (3) program requirements for the RNBSN. Results A total of 33 participants completed the RN-BSN retention program study. The findings indicated that several general factors contribute to retention and student success, including student support services, mandatory orientation programs for students and faculty, credit student success courses, remedial academic ability programs (which discuss support services, particularly computer tech support), and recognizing the importance of diversity in the classroom and at work. Conclusion Examining the characteristics of distance education students, as well as their distinct abilities and needs, may assist schools in improving student retention. Reconsidering the characteristics and unique features of distance learning students may help schools retain students with a variety of needs, such as access to scholarships, loans, and financial incentives to continue their education.",European Journal of Educational Sciences,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.19044/ejes.v9no2a107', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.19044/ejes.v9no2a107?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.19044/ejes.v9no2a107, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a48ea3d487a63c2553248e88bf532030dfef1e99,CS4All: An Early Look at Teacher Implementation in NYC,"CS for All initiatives have emerged around the country in the last decade with the hopes of addressing the growing call for all students to have opportunities to be proficient computational thinkers and to be exposed to computer science (CS) curriculum throughout their educational careers. As districts and states grapple with the realities of implementing such initiatives, they must address a key barrier: a lack of teacher capacity to teach CS. NYC's Computer Science for All (CS4All) is a 10-year, districtwide initiative aimed at providing high-quality computer science (CS) education to all public-school students. To address teacher capacity issues, the district has designed and implemented professional development (PD) with the goal of providing high-quality training to nearly 5,000 teachers by 2025. We conducted online surveys with about 1,500 teachers who participated in the multi-day professional development to assess the early outcomes of this effort. Results from two years of surveys offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, ability of teachers to implement CS in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering CS (even in a district where CS is a priority). They also provide insight into how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs compared to schools serving students with lower economic needs.

7487b20b6817d0bdd55379647db2c71a453ee687,Analysis of Artificial Intelligence Training Indicators According to the Results of Russian Universities Monitoring,"Artificial intelligence (hereinafter referred to as AI) is currently an area of strategic importance and a key technology ensuring a new digital economy development in Russia. Qualified AI specialist's training plays an important role in achieving ambitious AI-related goals as stated in government documents. The article presents survey results of more than 200 Russian universities, which enabled to create indicators characterizing both current and planned training volumes of AI specialists.According to the research results, Russian universities have responded quickly to the AI market development. Since 2019, they have been enrolling students at AI learning programs by intensifying training volumes annually. More than half of all AI learning programs are implemented within the «09.00.00 Informatics and Computer Science» and «01.00.00 Mathematics and Mechanics» majors/ specialties. AI specialist training in Russian universities is largely carried out at the expense of budgetary funds.

5d8281eeff0058dcaebea1e7cf20fa0675f94d8d,LAunchPad: The Design and Evaluation of a STEM Recruitment Program for Women,"This paper presents the design and evaluation of a university-sponsored summer STEM recruitment program for young women between their junior and senior year in high school. The College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology (ECST) currently has a female enrollment of only 15%, which is below the national average of 20%. The College has set a goal of increasing the percentage of women to 25% by 2025. The recruitment program described in this paper is one of the strategies the ECST will use to reach its goal. The objectives of the recruitment program, LAunchPad, were to increase the students’ interest in engineering and computer science, and to achieve a 50% participant matriculation rate into the College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology. LAunchPad established a gender-inclusive learning environment, with scaffolded instruction and hands-on activities to reinforce the learning. The students were also introduced to two groups of female role models; the first group was early-career alumni that held technical positions with local companies, and the second group was mid- to senior-level engineers, computer scientists, and executives. A post-event survey revealed that the students’ interest in pursuing an engineering or computer science career increased by 29%; seventy percent applied for admission to the University for the following Fall. Results suggest that contributing factors to the students’ increased interest are an increased understanding of engineering and computer science, increased confidence, access to diverse role models, and the ability to establish peer networks.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2018.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659097?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659097, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

74c74daf14485bb99052c18ea315424cfc5aac1f,Development of a Scale to Measure Attitudes toward Information Technology,"Educators, and business, and political leaders are increasingly recognizing that computing is a new basic skill necessary for economic opportunity and social mobility U.S. President Obama has announced a new initiative, “Computer Science For All” to empower a generation of American students with the computer science skills they need to thrive in a digital economy (2016). Employers seek technical computer specialists who can write software and invent new applications, but American universities are only training enough students to fill about 40% of the projected 1.1 million technology and computing jobs expected by 2024 (National Center for Women and Information Technology, 2016). Moreover, a lack of gender parity within the U.S. technology industry has long been viewed as a critical problem, detracting from innovation and prosperity. Pursuit of information technology (IT) majors depends, to a great extent, on students’ attitudes toward IT. This study developed an Attitude toward IT Scale with a gender subtext to measure certain attitudes toward IT, held by college students. The norm group consisted of mostly freshmen enrolled in 2011 (N = 373), at a large four-year public university in Illinois. Reliability and validity of the 30-item Scale were examined by using Cronbach’s alpha and a principal components factor analysis with orthogonal rotation using varimax with Kaiser normalization; the rotation converged in seven iterations. Results of data analyses showed that overall reliability is high (0.85), and factor analyses revealed five orthogonal factors with high coefficient alphas—factors that represented relevant attitude constructs. This Scale may be used by educators at the senior high school and college levels to evaluate the effectiveness of different teaching/learning strategies in promoting positive student attitudes toward IT, and in improving learning among students. The Scale is unique in that it includes attitudes toward gender equality of opportunity in IT.

The mission was selected in May 2012, and is now (May 2021) in the final stages of its integration and testing campaigns. Following its arrival at Jupiter in July 2031, JUICE will spend 4.2 years making detailed observations of Jupiter and three of the Galilean moons, Ganymede, Callisto and Europa.&#160; We present here the plan of activities to be carried out during the interplanetary cruise phase.</p>
<p>1. Trajectory during the cruise phase</p>
<p>The mission will be launched from Kourou with an Ariane 5. The baseline launch window is between 26 August &#8211; 15 September 2022, with a backup launch slot in August 2023. The interplanetary transfer sequence relies on gravity assist manoeuvres with Venus, Earth and the Moon. The Jupiter orbit insertion will be performed in July 2031. The cruise phase officially starts after the end of the near-Earth commissioning (launch + 3 months) and ends six months before the Jupiter orbit insertion, when the nominal science mission begins.</p>
<p>The list of planetary gravity assists is given in Table 1:</p>

<p>2. Spacecraft and mission constraints during the cruise phase</p>
<p>The main limitations during the cruise phase are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Priority of operations in support of navigation and spacecraft safety, especially in the preparation of gravity assist manoeuvres, in particular the world premiere of Lunar-Earth gravity assist</li>
<li>The thermal design of the spacecraft which imposes, for heliocentric distances lower than 1.34 AU, restricted pointing capabilities and limitations in the number of instruments that can operate simultaneously.</li>
<li>Quiet Cruise baseline: Reduced number of ground contacts (one ground station pass per week except for planetary flybys).</li>
<li>Operational constraint to minimize the use of the mass memory during Cruise to preserve unit lifetime, limiting the possibility to operate the instruments and store their data.</li>
<li>Budgetary restrictions that result in small operation teams during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>The baseline operations of the instruments are two one-week checkouts per year. It is expected that at least some of the observations will take place during the planetary flybys, with different possibilities still under study. The requests for operating the payload beyond this baseline will be carefully analyzed and agreed on a best-effort basis. The next section gives example of possible observations.</p>
<p>3. Potential scientific investigations to be performed during the cruise phase</p>
<p>Instrument operations during the cruise phase are always useful: they allow calibrating instruments in known environments (e.g. solar wind, Earth&#8217;s magnetosphere), checking possible interferences between instruments, they provide scientific results (sometimes not expected and outstanding, resulting in high standard publications) and attract public attention. During the long cruise phase of the JUICE mission, a number of scientific opportunities have been identified, beyond the obvious case of the planetary flybys. They include: solar wind campaigns, neutral atoms imaging in the heliosphere, measurement of Jovian escaping relativistic electrons, measurements of interplanetary dust, test of the general relativity around solar conjunctions, observation of the cosmological radio background, and an asteroid flyby (to be further studied).</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>JUICE teams activities during the cruise phase</p>
<p>The JUICE teams (mission operation center, science operations center, instrument teams, science working team, working groups, project scientist and mission manager) will be busy with numerous activities. A non-exhaustive list is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spacecraft navigation and operations in the inner solar system, including planetary flybys and payload checkouts;</li>
<li>Decision about an asteroid flyby (shortly after launch);</li>
<li>Analysis of the cruise data, instrument calibration, scientific analysis, publication and archive;</li>
<li>Refinement and agreement (three years before Jupiter orbit insertion) on the trajectory within the Jupiter system;</li>
<li>Preparation of the science planning of the nominal mission and of the science analysis of the future data;</li>
<li>Studying and preparing the coordination with ground-based and space observatories;</li>
<li>Publication of a special issue with mission, instruments and science articles;</li>
<li>Recruitment of guest investigators and of potentially additional interdisciplinary scientists;</li>
<li>Continue the fruitful collaboration with the NASA Clipper teams.</li>
<li>Conclusions</li>
</ul>
<p>The JUICE cruise phase, despite its long duration (9 years), will be busy with many activities, with the goal of being fully ready to start the scientific observations from early 2031 onwards.</p>

6dd70b8a661cdad8ab9ef00b4ae3d07e70674c0c,Exploration on the Construction of Fundamentals of Robotics Innovative Course under the Background of New Engineering,"With the rapid development of robotics, the significance of the course construction of robotics in the construction of new engineering courses in colleges and universities in China has become increasingly prominent. Fundamentals of Robotics is an interdisciplinary course, through which students' cognitive level and innovative practical ability of robotics can be cultivated. According to the characteristics of the robotics course, it studies and explores the teaching orientation, course content, implementation method, evaluation system and construction conditions and guarantee of robotics course in this paper, and puts forward the course construction plan from the perspective of improving the innovation ability, which provides some ideas for the robot course construction. Introduction In recent years, China has become one of the fastest growing countries in the robot industry. In May 2015, the State Council officially issued Made in China 2025. In the ten strategic areas, robot is the second strategic area, its importance is self-evident. In February 2017, the Ministry of Education issued the Notice of the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education on Research and Practice of New Projects. Its main purpose is to carry out teaching methods and curriculum reform, and cultivate high-end application-oriented talents in a more effective way[1-3]. Robot has the natural attribute of high-tech content and multi-disciplinary integration. It is a good carrier to carry out a new round of engineering reform and improve the quality of teaching. Therefore, it is of great value and significance to carry out robot course construction and robot teaching task design in applied undergraduate colleges. Current Situation and Development Trend of Robot Education In May 2016, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance jointly issued the Development Plan of Robot Industry (2016-2020), which proposed the overall development goal of China's robot industry during the 13th Five Year Plan period, that is, ""To form a relatively complete robot industry system, significantly improve the technological innovation ability and international competitiveness, achieve the performance level of similar products in the world, make major breakthroughs in the quality level of key parts, and basically meet the market demand."" Since then, the application and demand of robots in various industries have been expanding. At the same time, there are not enough high-level professionals engaged in robot system design and development, robot technology integration and robot system installation. In the National Vocational College Skills Competition Implementation Plan (2017-2020) released in September 2016, it was clearly proposed that the skills competition in the next 10 years should focus on the Made in China 2025 strategy. Therefore, as a key development field of Made in China 2025, robot will become an increasingly important direction of applied undergraduate and vocational college curriculum education and personnel training. 2020 Conference on Educational Science and Educational Skills (ESES2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000606 ISBN: 978-1-80052-003-5 -309At present, more and more science and engineering subjects in colleges and universities begin to offer robotics, robot control and other related courses for undergraduate and junior graduate students. As a science and engineering discipline of application-oriented universities, strengthening the teaching construction and reform of robotics foundation and other related courses is one of the most forward-looking and innovative development directions. Developing robot education and building related knowledge system has become the key to the development of application-oriented universities[4-5]. Analysis of Characteristics of Robotics Course Teaching Robot technology integrates many advanced technologies such as mechanics, sensing, driving, control, computer software and hardware, and artificial intelligence. The course construction of robotics is naturally complex and comprehensive. The coupling of robot technology with other disciplines should be considered. At the same time, the practicality, innovation and relevance with robot related industries should be emphasized to ensure the role and significance of robot course construction. Comprehensive and Interactive Robot research is an interdisciplinary field. It is difficult for students to fully understand the robot's mechanical structure, motion control system, sensor system and the practice of practical engineering projects only through a single course. Facing to such a multi-disciplinary course, the traditional teaching mode can not be used to design and arrange teaching tasks. It is necessary to lay out the overall goal of talent training, consider the relevance between the front and back of the curriculum, and effectively set up an all-around discipline talent training system, so as not to become a ""lonely island"" of the curriculum. Experimental and Practical Robot course has a strong demand of experiment and practice. Only through the explanation of theoretical knowledge or the simulation of virtual technology, it is difficult for students to have an intuitive and comprehensive understanding of the robot system. In general, the investment of robot experimental equipment is relatively expensive. In order to ensure that students complete the necessary hands-on operation and debugging in the process of experiment and practice, it is necessary to coordinate the overall guarantee of the course equipment and teaching environment, so as to avoid the course ""emphasizing theory and ignoring practice"". Industry and Innovation At present, the robotics course and robotics discipline in China are just starting, and the staff engaged in the robotics industry are difficult to meet the post requirements in a short period of time, so the phenomenon of application-oriented talents vacancy has formed. Based on these, on the one hand, it is necessary to evaluate the promotion and supply function of the course construction to the current robot industry environment, on the other hand, it is also necessary to consider the medium and long-term construction and innovation development of the course, so as to form a solid and powerful course construction scheme and robot innovation talent reserve. The Construction of Fundamentals of Robotics Innovative Course based on Innovative Thinking Teaching Orientation of the Course The course Fundamentals of Robotics (referred to as the course ) is a task-driven professional course that integrates theory and practice. Through good connection with the pre and follow-up courses, with the method of ""integration of theory and practice, learning and doing"", and with the goal of ""flexible learning and application of learning"", students can start from the robot body and practical",2020 Conference on Educational Science and Educational Skills (ESES2020),2020.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38007/proceedings.0000606?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38007/proceedings.0000606, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Now the age of Information Revolution based on intelligence has arrived. In this critical period, the completion of the digital process in the energy sector, the realization of the Information revolution, will directly affect the development of the energy sector Information revolution. The power grid is the basic platform of energy development and utilization, and the State Grid enterprises assume the important social responsibility. Through the construction of the power grid, the Internet of things will be integrated into the digital economy, complete the ""Made in China 2025"" and welcome the arrival of the ""Industry 4.0"". 1. The role of industrial revolution in China In the history of the development of modern human society, there have been three industrial revolutions, each revolution will push the human society to a new height of development. Of course, the world's Lion China also benefited from the rapid development The widespread use of Watt's steam engine in Britain in the 1860s also had an indirect impact on China as it opened its doors to the world and learned advanced science and technology from the West. The development of the Self-Strengthening Movement, the dispatch of foreign students, the establishment of new schools, the planning of coastal defense, the establishment of Jiangnan Machinery Manufacturing Bureau, the rise of various types of enterprises in China, and so on, lead to the development of isolationism China. This industrial technology revolution is known as ""Industry 1.0"" and it was the age of the steam engine [1]. From the 1960s to the early 20th century, electricity replaced steam as an important energy source, marking the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution. At this time, China's domestic and foreign troubles, world capitalism began to develop from liberal capitalism to monopoly capitalism. Imperialist aggression against China shifted from the production of goods to the production of capital, controlling the lifeblood of China's economy. This era is known as ""industry 2.0"" and it is the age of electrification [1]. The third new scientific and technological revolution came in the middle of the 20th century. Represented by the application of atomic energy technology, space technology and computer technology, major breakthroughs have been made in scientific theory and scientific and technological innovation, accelerating the development of the world economy. This is both an opportunity and a challenge for China. With China's reform and opening up, it adjusted the direction of development in time, caught up with the trend of the times, so that China's economy began to take off. This era is known as ""industry 3.0"" [1]. At present, the technological revolution based on artificial intelligence, clean energy, robotics, quantum information technology, virtual reality and biotechnology is rising quietly Known as the ""Industry 4.0, "" this is an era of intelligence in which information technology is used to transform industries, and its arrival will dramatically alter existing modes of production and living. In April 2013, at the German Hannover Messe, the German government officially launched the concept of ""Industry 4.0"" to speed up the process of intellectualization and increase its competitiveness worldwide. In March 2015, Premier Li Keqiang presented the first ""Made in China 2025"" grand plan in the NPC'S report on the work of the government.

The influence of industrial revolution on China's electric power industry Since the mid-1980s, China's power system has undergone three major reforms. The first is reform of the investment system. From relying solely on government investment to introducing foreign investment, encouraging private capital to invest in power construction, solving the problem of power construction funds, has greatly promoted the development of power supply. Second, the separation of factory and network reform. In 2002, the State Council issued document No. 5, which clearly proposed that the former state power companies should be divided into seven according to the principle of ""separating plant networks and bidding on the Internet"", and establish two power grid companies and five power generation groups. This reform adapts to the rapid growth of the national economy and the surge of the demand for electricity, which makes the construction scale of the power grid reach an unprecedented level. The third is a separate reform of resettlement. At the heart of this reform is the dismantling of grid companies in the power production, transport, trade and consumption chains. Power sales, regulation of natural monopoly, liberalization of non-natural monopoly, introduction of competition mechanism, market determines the allocation of power resources. These three reforms have a far-reaching impact on the development of the electric power industry and the national economy as a whole [3]. Every reform faces changes in management systems, models and processes. Prior to the first reform, the power companies were managed in accordance with government management functions and were managed and developed as functional units. GOVERNMENT-ENTERPRISE MERGER MODEL, provincial, municipal and county-level power companies relatively independent, investment and construction funds shortage. After the reform and opening-up, the power investment channel is strengthened, the power grid construction strength is strong, the power grid scale is expanding day by day. With the second reform of the power system, China's power industry has formed a unified power management industry dominated by the two major power grid companies and the five major power generation groups, making the management of the power industry more standardized, professional, and also adapt to modern enterprises. The management request has formed the consummation management business process, the province, the city, the county electric power management department has changed from the function management to the process management. 3. Basic function of electric network In the process of digitalization developing to intelligentization, a new technological revolution will be set off. This year, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) proposed the comprehensive construction of the ""ubiquitous power internet of things"", which is part of the ""Made in China 2025"" and an important strategic layout for SGCC to go to China and realize the ""Industry 4.0"". After more than 140 years' development, China's power industry has realized Regional Power Grid Operation Structure and regional balance of China's power energy. The Electric Power Industry has become an important basis for China's energy transformation and upgrading. Information, digital and smart devices and technologies will be widely used in the power industry. One end of the grid is connected to energy production, and energy consumption is the basic platform for energy development and utilization [5]. It will closely link energy production and energy consumption, lead the pace of the industrial revolution in the energy field, become the forefront of the process of power digitalization and information, will become the leader of the Digital Economy Era.

The Foresight Brain Science, Addiction and Drugs project reports over the summer of 2005 after a 20-month study that has involved experts from as diverse a range of disciplines as history and economics through to genomics and imaging. Like all Foresight projects, the Brain Science, Addiction and Drugs project has a Stakeholder Group. The group is chaired by Lord Warner, Minister for the Department of Health and has representatives from the Home Office, police, Medical Research Council, Wellcome Trust and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics as well as other organizations that have a great interest in this area. To assist with the development of the project’s scope, Foresight gathered together experts to brainstorm the evolution of their own technologies over the next 20 years. From this, several novel issues relating to addiction emerged such as what will be the place of cognitive enhancers (modafinil and sequelae) in 2025 and to what extent gambling and other forms of behavioural addiction share brain processes with drug and alcohol addiction. In the next stage of the project a series of ‘State-of-Science’ reviews was commissioned. Fifteen of these have been completed covering all elements of brain science, addiction and cognate disciplines – these will be available as 12000-word papers on the Foresight website (www.foresight.gov.uk). They provide an invaluable resource for anyone wishing to easily update their knowledge on the current state of play in addiction and brain sciences related to it. The outputs from these reviews feed into the project’s Horizon Scanning activity where ‘best guesses’ of future trends and achievements are made. This process also involves other relevant knowledge groups such as the pharmaceutical and drinks industries, as well as individual insights into non-drug addictions such as gambling. Finally, the future is explored using scenarios – a process of growing sophistication and robustness that allows a range of different futures to be estimated and explored in the context of current knowledge and possible future technologies. This brings in wider-ranging perspectives such as the effect of changes in political and regulatory attitudes. What are the findings of this Foresight project? These can be found on the website, so I give here a sample of the discussion that is particularly relevant to the readers of the Journal of Psychopharmacology. What will be the state of psychoactive substance use in 2025? This is hard to predict as so many unknowns determine it – ranging from political ideologies through use-fashions and the possible discovery of new drugs. It seems likely that most of the currently abused drugs will still be around, though there may be a few newcomers. Of the few certainties, one is that brain science will continue to grow as a discipline and so we shall have a much better knowledge of the brain mechanisms of addiction and hopefully better approaches to treatment. Especial hope for treatment is given by the rapidly emerging knowledge of the processes of memory which leads to the potential for interventions that help addicts to ‘unlearn’ addiction. However, translating these advances in neuroscience into new therapeutics is potentially difficult and may require a new paradigm in drug regulatory and pricing systems. For instance it may be unclear whether certain drugs would be treated as therapeutic or for enhancement for normal function. The uncertain nature of risk–benefit in the field of drug treatments is also of concern especially in the area of regulating drugs for addiction where the users have higher rates of other illnesses and also usually use other drugs. The possibility that Europe might consider setting up partnerships between the EU and pharmaceutical companies to share the risks in this field may be one way to progress this. Other areas for possible cooperation include facilitating availability of novel compounds into academia. As a footnote it may be worth noting that the BAP has had a significant role in this Foresight programme. Two of the three scientific leaders are ex-presidents of the association (Nutt and Robbins), and many of the experts involved in the process at all stages are BAP members. The output of Foresight will be presented to the BAP as a special session at this year’s summer meeting.

There were about 150 participants from the United States and neighboring countries such as the Republic of Palau. The author presented the actual condition of our research and the theory of civilization at the keynote lecture. The contents of our study are clarified in “Possibility of the biophilia rehabilitation.” The theory of civilization has to be considered because of the following idea; it is necessary to solve the problems accompanying the coming demographic transition including great subjects, such as philosophy, industrial environment, a policy, etc. which makes possible for the baby boomers who became advanced age to contribute to the society. The research of the rehabilitation was published at the e-journal of Japan Science and Technology Corporation (State Organization) by five articles from January 31, 2003. The research progress was clarified in this keynote lecture. The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHLW) set the population ratio of the elderly aged 65 and over in 2025 to 1 to 5 by the estimate of population in 1975, and introduced the silver city plan. The author presented own motivation for the study as follows; i) became the Fujisawa municipal assemblyman in 1979, ii) expected the arrival of the aged society by baby boomers' aging, iii) estimated the population dynamics by a computer which new those days, and iv) proposed enforcement of the policy corresponding to it. The estimate of the elderly population ratio in Fujisawa in 2025 was presented to the local assembly the result 1 to 4 or more. Next, the author explained his related content and fact about the rehabilitation for making the aged society expected sustainable. The regulation of the Health and Medical Service for the Aged was introduced in 1987. The city functional training meeting under the regulation was established from April Chigasaki City in adjoining for the disabled elderly of being home in the same year. The Fujisawa City’s one was established by the coordination with a medical association and was established by accepting only the disabled elderly of a disuse sustentation term from October. The Fujisawa’s meeting was ""a functional training meeting in which only those not recovering participate (impairment) "" as a lawmaker understanding from the development. The physiotherapist, Kyoko Takizawa began service at the Fujisawa’s meeting. She rehabilitated the disabled elderly who were diagnosed impairment and was getting for them remarkable results as ""those who found the improvement of condition, those who did the social (place of work) return, and those who hint suicide from disability came to tell hope."" Many patients gained a walk from bedridden in the Nagaoka Bedridden Hospital by her rehabilitation around the same time. The effect was published already 2). Besides, Kyoko Takizawa had worked as the PT of the Fujisawa Citizen Hospital. She had performed rehabilitation of the same method collaborating with two helpers for 15,000 patients every year according to the operating report of the hospital. The author persuaded her that there was a necessity to admit that her performing a rehabilitation was a method. She (the author’s mother) had not understood it for a long time depending on "" my hand is an incantatory hand since I do so that they can walk wholly."" As the years go by, it was important for the author choosing to enforce the research than the future of a politician because the social cognition of a rehabilitation system was required to sustain the aged society.

2b73c6f8be2b7633a8db12f3be71daab8fadd71c,245th American Chemical Society Meeting and Exposition (ACS Spring 2013),"The 245th American Chemical Society Meeting and Exposition took place in Morial Convention Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, on April 7–11, 2013. New Orleans, located in southeastern Louisiana and by the mouth of the Mississippi River, was founded by the French Mississippi Company in 1718 and named for the Regent of France at that time, Philippe d’Orléans, Duke of Orléans. This “sleepless” city with the population of 350 000 people is famous for its distinct French architecture, diverse culture, jazz music, annual celebrations and festivals, and Cajun food. The city also reminds us of damaging Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and people who seriously suffered from the hurricane but have learned to turn the fears and challenges into opportunities. The American Chemical Society (ACS) has more than 164 000 members, and is the world’s largest scientific society. It holds the spring and fall meetings each year, bringing in 15 000 industry, academic and government professionals around the world and providing the biggest platform for thousands of researchers to share their up-to-date scientific and professional information through plenary sessions, symposia, poster sessions, exhibitions, and networking events. Each meeting has its own chemistry-related theme. This year, 27 divisions and seven committees hosted various programs based on the meeting theme of Chemistry of Energy and Food. With over 15 000 attendees, the meeting received almost 12 000 papers and had 4500 poster presentations as well as a number of special events, such as governance and business meetings, division meeting and social events, presidential events, national awards, industrial awards, educational events for students and teachers, professional advancements in New Orleans etc. Symposia covered a wide range of topics, including food and nutrition, medicine, health, energy, environment, and other fields where chemistry plays a central role in preventing and combating disease, and organized by various divisions, such as Division of Agricultural and Food Chemistry (26 symposia), Division of Biological Chemistry (25 symposia), Division of Chemical Health and Safety (six symposia), Division of Chemical Education (39 symposia), Division of Energy and Fuels (31 symposia), Division of Polymer Chemistry (22 symposia) etc. The details on the divisions and their symposia can be viewed at http://abstracts.acs.org/ chem/245nm/program/divisionindex.php. Sunday afternoon was the plenary session, based on the meeting theme of Chemistry of Energy and Food, and organized by thematic program chair Prof. James N. Seiber, Food Science and Technology Department, UC Davis, CA. Four invited speakers from universities and industry shared their expertise in “Chemistry of food flavors: Simply pleasure or beyond?” (Peter Schieberle, Department of Food Chemistry, Technical University of Munich, Freising, Freising, Germany); “Feeding the world through science and technology: A Look into our future food system” (John D Floros, College of Agriculture, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS); “Kitchen as laboratory: building bridges between science and the non-scientist” (Cesar Vega, Mars Botanical, Mars, Inc., Germantown, MD); “Microalgal triglyderide oils: A new source of renewable oil for energy and food” (Walter Rakitsky, Solazyme, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Starting from Monday morning, presidential event, organized by the ACS president Dr. M. Wu, had different sessions covering the topics of Understanding Climate Change, Vision 2025: How to Succeed in the Global Chemistry Enterprise, and Water: A Grand Challenge for Science and Society. Those sessions brought in presidents of chemical societies around the world and leaders from industry, academia, government and small business to explore the global challenges and opportunities. Besides the plenary session and presidential event, a number of symposia focused on the theme of this year’s ACS meeting. The symposium on Polymer Composites for Energy Harvesting, Conversion and Storage by the Division of Polymer Chemistry discussed five up-to-date research topics, including fundamental studies of structure-propertyperformance relationships and applications of these materials in photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, fuel cells and batteries, and energy storage. More than 30 speakers presented state-of-art synthesis, characterization, measurement and modeling techniques applied to polymer composites. Invited speaker Prof. M. Dadman, University of Tennessee, addressed the key processing challenges, such as structural and morphological control and interface characterization, and their solutions using neutron scattering technique. Another invited speaker Prof. D. Carroll, Wake Forest University, presented polymer nanocomposites for thermoelectric applications, which could convert waste heat into electricity power. Computer modeling combined with experiments play crucial and integrated roles, to provide detailed insight into structure, capture the structure–property–performance relationships, advance the understanding of experimental observations, as well as rapidly speed up new materials development. The symposium on Theory and Simulation in Energy and Fuel Production and Utilization organized by the Division of Energy and Fuels reported recent development and implementation of theory and computational modeling approaches for energy research.

c5157c6dd51a53756c6a7509396e64ae5e45390c,Foreign language education in Louisiana: A cluster analysis,"Louisiana is currently the only state in the United States that requires foreign language (FL) study for some, but not all of their high school students, and these requirements are undergoing seismic changes. Considering that geographic, economic, and integration factors contribute to whether a school can provide FL at all—and biased counseling dissuades minoritized students from taking FL—this study asks: has FL education been equitably accessible to all Louisiana high school students who want to pursue it, regardless of race or economic background? To address this question, this paper presents results from two analyses. First, program‐internal equity variables (e.g., [dis]similarity between school‐wide and FL student demographics) were clustered to produce “profiles” of FL programs. Next, a multinomial logistic regression using program‐external factors (e.g., federal funding status, desegregation orders) was conducted to isolate the factors impacting equity. Federal funding and rurality were both found to be significant, with schools receiving federal Title I funds and rural schools being much more likely to exhibit inequitable access to FL courses. In (a) identifying schools with enrollment inequities and (b) the outside factors associated with greater inequity, this paper aims to provide policymakers with empirically based tools to address (in)equity in Louisiana high school FL education. These findings can be especially helpful in light of the state's recent (2023‐2024 school year) expansion of FL requirements to accept computer science courses.",Foreign language annals,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/flan.12737?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/flan.12737, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6077db0e71b4356d50812566a8df46c56ccb5b40,Stunting in Indonesian Children and Its Contributing Factors: Study through Bibliometric Analysis,"Children's stunting is a problem because it is associated with an increased risk of pain and death, suboptimal brain development resulting in late motor development, and inhibition of mental growth. This study aims to examine the factors that influence the occurrence of stunting and risk in children in Indonesia. The research method used is a traditional review. The results of the review found that many factors cause the high incidence of stunting in toddlers, including energy intake, birth weight, maternal knowledge level, family economic status, parental parenting, and food security. WHO estimates the prevalence of stunting worldwide at 22 percent or as many as 149.2 million in 2020. According to the Indonesian Nutritional Status Study (SSGI) results of the Ministry of Health, the prevalence of stunting in children under five in Indonesia reached 24.4% in 2021. The prevalence of stunting of toddlers in Indonesia continues to show a decline. In 2018 the prevalence of stunting toddlers was still 30.8%. Then, it dropped to 27.7 in 2019 and continued to fall to 24.4% in SSGI 2024. The government even targets to drop to 14% by the end of 2024. Furthermore, WHO also recommends reducing stunting by 3.9% per year to meet the target of 40% stunting reduction by 2025.

9df3c72454a5c5351455057f1ea3f1276c6b62a7,Introduction: Processes and Palaeo-Environmental Changes in the Arctic from Past to Present (PalaeoArc) special issue,"PalaeoArc (Processes and Palaeo-Environmental Changes in the Arctic: From Past to Present) is an international network research programme, the aim of which is to understand and explain the climatically induced environmental changes in the Arctic that have taken place throughout the Quaternary and continue in the present-day (see http://www.palaeoarc.no/). This network builds on and extends the impressive legacy of previous palaeo-Arctic network programs and projects extending back to the 1980s. This began with the “Polar North Atlantic Margins—Late Cenozoic Evolution” project (PONAM: 1990–1994; Hjort and Persson 1994; Landvik and Salvigsen 1995; Elverhøi et al. 1998), which was followed by the “Quaternary Environment of the Eurasian North” project (QUEEN: 1996–2002; e.g., Larsen, Funder, and Thiede 1999; Thiede et al. 2001, 2004; Kjær et al. 2006). These were then followed by the “Arctic Palaeoclimate and Its Extremes” project (APEX: 2004–2012; Jakobsson et al. 2008, 2010, 2014) and the “Palaeo-Arctic Spatial and Temporal Gateways” project (PAST Gateways: 2012–2018; Ó Cofaigh et al. 2016, 2018). The latest incarnation of the network—PalaeoArc— was conceived at the final meeting of the PAST Gateways project in Durham, UK, in April 2019, when a new international steering committee was appointed to organize a series of activities and annual conferences for the following six years (2019–2024). The new international network held its first meeting in Poznań (20– 24 May 2019), hosted by the Faculty of Geographical and Geological Sciences, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań (see Lyså et al. 2019), comprising the usual mix of talks, posters, discussions, workshops, and a field excursion. The network planned to organize a conference hosted by the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Pisa in May 2020, but this had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was eventually held online in May 2021, endorsed by the International Arctic Science Council, Italian Geological Society, and Italian Association for the Study of the Quaternary. The meeting proved incredibly popular and was “attended” by over 250 Arctic scientists from twenty-six different countries over a four-day period, allowing glacial and marine geologists, palaeoceanographers, palaeoecologists, and specialists in permafrost and numerical modeling to discuss records of Arctic environmental change over decadal to millennial timescales. The collection of articles in this special issue stems from this second PalaeoArc International Conference and encompasses the diverse range of topics presented at the meeting, each of which addresses the overarching aims of PalaeoArc (detailed below). The third international PalaeoArc conference took place (in person) in Rovaniemi in August 2022. The network has been extended for a year, with further meetings planned in Akureyri (2023), Stockholm (2024), and Tromsø (2025).","Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research",2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15230430.2022.2154985?needAccess=true&role=button', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/15230430.2022.2154985?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2022.2154985, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f83aa0d616373061232552b3fb5f2f915313682e,Dual Dimensions of VR Education Development: Vision and Technology Direction,"The visual display characteristics of VR have changed the flatness of knowledge in traditional education, and its immersion characteristics and students' learning process can produce good fusion, VR can change students’ alienation of technology and learning process in the classroom. There is close association logic between VR system and modern educational technology platform and classroom, simultaneously, it also accelerates the redistribution of educational resources and promotes the realization of education fairness. Experience and interest are procedural goal of VR education pursued, but in reality, the idea of parents, teachers and students, and the development of VR hardware level and scarcity of education content hinder the development of VR education, technology and demand for talented persons will be the key for VR education development in the future. VR has the potential to become a standard tool in the field of education, and educational content can be re-created using VR technology to form a new VR education ecosystem. The deep involvement of technology and the systematic reconstruction of education have brought more diverse teaching and learning changes through the rotation. Horizon Report (2016 Higher Education Edition) regards VR technology as the key technology to resolve deep learning contradictions in the next 2-3 years. VR technology brings high immersion and fun to students, making it the most promising star technology in education after multimedia and Internet, it has largely subverted the traditional teaching methods, and deeper educational sources problem will likely be touched. 1. A New Vision of VR Technology and Education Around 2009, the era of consumption of mobile intelligent terminal devices based on traffic dividends entered a recession stage. Application technologies with more innovative concepts have spawned two major industrial innovation directions: VR and IOT, which have triggered the basic entrepreneurial and employment situation of the VR industry. 2016 was called the first year of VR industry, and huge amounts of capital poured into the VR industry. According to the forecast of the multinational investment bank Goldman Sachs Group in early 2016, the global VR market revenue scale is expected to soar to 60 billion US dollars in 2025. China's huge market capacity will make it the main force in the global VR market. The British magazine Economist wrote that China is leading the world in the VR popularization. The synergy between education and technology can change the world we live in. The popularization of VR+ education has caused students to change their understanding of learning. A Samsung survey on VR in the United States shows that 85% of teachers believe that the use of VR technology in the internet plus era can improve students' learning efficiency in teaching. The significance of education is to enhance the richness of students' life experience. The participatory learning process makes personalized education truly a reality. The VR system built on the internet has made education alive, and it has brought a new vision of education in the cultivation of artisan spirit, student scene knowledge learning and learning resources. VR has brought a new educational technology revolution. 2. The Logic of VR System and Modern Education “Internet plus” represents a new way of life, new ecological concept and new economic format.

d60a6f460bdd13c4bef271aa4b72e95187a759e5,A Sanctuary of Memory in Viet Thank Nguyen’s “Black-Eyed Women”,"Diasporic literature has always brought out the pains and tribulations of the diasporans in the settled land. It has grown far and wide in the contemporary era. Such a dynamic field of literary studies not only presents the problems of the diasporans but gives solutions to the same. This research paper is one such attempt to propose the ways in which the diasporans can relieve themselves from the pains experienced in the hostland, as embedded in Viet Thanh Nguyen’s short story “BlackEyed Women”. Keywords— Memory, diaspora, first and second generation diasporans, ghosts. Memory is the word that activates the world and ensures the existence of lives on earth. All animals and people are bestowed with memories that keep them moving on earth. Life sans memories cannot flourish as they would be computers sans CPU. In such a circumstance life would become meaningless. According to Elie Wiesel, a RomanianAmerican poet, Without memory, there is no culture Without memory, there would be No civilization, no society, no future. (Wiesel) It is quite evident that without memory, human beings would be mere mortals who would die every second if they do not remember anything. Memory also delineates the personality of a person based on the type of memory he or she has. To define memory, it can be called as the retention or recollection of incidents, happenings and every single action around people. They are information that are encoded, stored and retrieved later. Memory works based on sensory organs and every living thing possesses memory, but only the range and the capacity of it differ in everyone. Based on the range of memory, information imbued in a person can be classified into three types of memories as sensory, short-term and long-term memory. This division is based on the range and the type of information that is piled up. Information that are fed through the sensory organs like eyes, nose, ear, tongue and skin are stored in sensory memory. For instance, the smell of rain, coffee or hearing a sound or music gets accumulated here. Short-term memory holds information for limited period, say, a few hours or days and are available for immediate access. This cannot hold larger amount of inputs as they are limited in capacity. Longterm memory stays in the mind for years together, sometimes for the whole life. These memories often comprises of objects and incidents that affect one’s self personally. Besides these, ‘Flashbulb Memories’ are yet another type of memory that do not fit under any time or range. They acquire such a name as they appear suddenly like flash floods. Unlike the other memories, these occur as vivid and highly detailed snapshots that originate at the times of shock or trauma. Recalling of personal events in which one is deeply injured or affected physically or mentally leads to flashbulb memories. These memories are the ones that kindle various feelings in everyone be it positive or negative. Apart from storage, memories undergo multiple levels of processing such as shallow processing or deep or semantic processing. In shallow processing, only the overall appearance of the incident gets projected whereas deep or semantic processing involves elaborative rehearsal of memories. In deep processing, the repercussions of the incident or something which may happen in future are synthesised. Further, some memories do not undergo any of the above mentioned processings, but, they fade and get into oblivion. This is called forgetting and this happens due to age, mental capacity or internal imbalances. Another phenomenon that supplements forgetting is interference. When some new information is fed, they interfere with the old memories because they may be interrelated with the old. Aligned with how these affect the existing memories, they can be proactive and retroactive. In retroactive memories they may inhibit the ability to memorise new information and in proactive memories they correlate with old information to store the upcoming ones. The cognitive psychologist Elizabeth Lofters in her research on the reliability of memories, discovered that even some false memories can be implanted to erase the existing or to International Journal of English, Literature and Social Sciences (IJELS) Vol-4, Issue-6, Nov – Dec 2019 https://dx.doi.org/10.22161/ijels.46.62 ISSN: 2456-7620 www.ijels.com Page | 2024 make believe something else. This is achieved with the help of violence and usage of weapons. These false memories that are rooted in the minds become a threat to the people compelling them to forget their true past and prodding them to get used to the newly injected ideas. All these kinds of memories play a vital role in the life of the diasporans. Diasporans are people who migrate to an alien land by interest in search of greener pastures or the people who are transported by force or compulsion like slaves or expatriates. While the first category of people try to get accustomed to the hostland, the latter the slaves and expatriates live in eternal sadness and fear. The word ‘diaspora’ is literally derived from the Greek word ‘diaspero’, which means ‘to scatter or to disperse’. This term was first used to represent the dispersion or the expulsion of the Jews from Judea after the conquest of Babylon. The term had also been used to represent the Africans who were sent to England and America as slaves. These kinds of people are called ‘diasporans’. Presently, in the twenty first century, the term is used to denote the people who leave their motherland and settle in other countries for some reason. The diasporic communities are also named after the places they have left like Asian Diaspora, Indian Diaspora, Canadian Diaspora, European Diaspora and others. Having settled in the host country, the diasporans face numerous hostile situations. Wearing the badge of two identities of the motherland and the fatherland, they live inbetween two cultures and sway with hyphenated identities as hybridised individuals. Resultantly, an attitude of not-athomeness surfaces in them at most moments. Not-athomeness is one of the characteristic features of the feeling of non-acceptance or alienation by which they, eventually become marginalised. These marginalised men strive hard to find their identities in their lives that are filled with rejection, prejudice and uncertainty. In such a bid, they seek different methods to adapt to either of the cultures by changing their life styles akin to that of the people of the hostland. Nevertheless, at times they fail in their attempts and feel like the translocated plants, that wither out in an hostile environment. Despite such an experience, the Diasporans hardly can return to their native country. Eventually, they try to evade from the pains in the new land, by clinging on to the memories of their motherland. In order to keep their memories alive and to experience at-homeness, they try to hold on to something of their motherland. They treasure some souvenirs of their ancestors in their minds or carry them in their suitcases. Recalling of such homeland memories gives them an enormous strength and help them sustain their lives in the adopted land. It is to be underscored that the diasporans tug with them their language, culture, custom and ethnicity wherever they move. They are unable to sever themselves from their past land immediately and fully. Moreover, facing hostility in the host land, it becomes necessary for them to firmly hold on to and retain their native culture and try to create a mid-world between the two, to bridge the gap at least to some extent. In the creation of a unique mid-world, wherein they are torn between both the lands, memories are used as building materials. In such an endeavour, some diasporans even emerge as ‘diasporic writers’ who pen down their memories with experiences as their scaffolding support. These diasporic writers focus on the off-centered people and try to unite their individual experiences collectively under one label as ‘Diaporans’, an identity or a label that they wear, irrespective of the nationalities they belong to. The writings also tend to be a collection of narrations of the heterogeneous people who face national, cultural, linguistic and ethnic challenges homogeneously in their day-to-day life at all levels. Their literary ventures give them a cathartic effect. This paper “A Sanctuary of Memory in Viet Thanh Nguyen’s “Black-Eyed Women” ” tries to analyse the different types of memories that steer the lives of the various generations of diasporans that build up a mid-world for them and also evaluates whether this created world is haunting or soothing to the diasporans as presented in the short story titled “The Black-Eyed Women” by Viet Thanh Nguyen. Being a diasporan of Vietnamese origin, Viet Thanh Nguyen lives with the hyphenated identity as VietnameseAmerican novelist. He heads the Aerol Arnold Chair of English and is presently working as a Professor of English, American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of California. Nguyen was born in Vietnam and was later moved to America due to war. Having experienced wars in Vietnam and as a displaced man his works are autobiographical loaded with his native land’s experiences. He reveals the toughened life of the diasporic people through his writings. He is an award winning novelist who has bagged a dozen of awards including Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Dayton Literary Prize for his debut novel Sympathiser in 2016.

55efee8b69ee5ebd65242da8e5a02584d06adf61,Analysis on the Development Status of Internet of Things Industry in China,"China began as early as the 1990s to pay attention to the study the development of the Internet of Things industry. At present, China is in the middle of the world. The networking industry has formed and possessed materials, technologies and devices. A series of industrial chains, such as components and networks, have reached the Internet of Things to national standards for industrialization. But there are still some deep-seated problems that restrict the development of the Internet of Things to be solved in China. 1. Current Situation of Internet of Things in China In recent years, vigorous support of national policies and Industry has developed rapidly. With the continuous efforts of enterprises, China's Internet of Things industry continues to be good. With the good momentum of development, the Internet of Things in China has initially formed a complete system. The industrial system possesses certain technology, industry and application. Basically, the demographic dividend is gradually disappearing and the human cost is rapidly increasing. At present, the application of Internet of Things technology is to solve the problem of human resources. 2. An Effective Way to Improve Operational Efficiency According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China will consolidate in 2014.The sales revenue of the Internet of Things has reached more than 600 billion yuan. In recent years, China's Internet of Things industry has achieved a comprehensive growth rate. Over 30% fully reflects its strong development trend. Especially, in the field of intelligent manufacturing industry Internet of Things and Intelligent Transportation Vehicle Networking, Good Market Prospect has high growth whose speed keeps climbing. According to statistical estimation, M2M connection, in China, whose number has exceeded 73 million in 2014, a year-on-year increase 46%, accounting for 30% of global M2M connections, continue to maintain holding the World's First Market Position, which in China's M2M Regulation in the Future. The model will continue to expand. It is expected to reach 350 million by 2020, globally whose the proportion will reach 36%. The Internet of Things has become public, in China, which is in terms of application development including the safety, civil Aviation, transportation, environmental monitoring, smart grid, agriculture, industry and other industries ,which have been initially applied on a large scale, and some products have already been used. The level of perimeter intrusion prevention system is in the leading position in the world. Intelligent Home, Intelligent Medical Services, etc. for Individual Users. Overall, the development of the Internet of Things industry in China presents itself. 3. The following characteristics First, The Internet of Things Industry is still in its early stage in China. There is no concept introduction period and industrial chain formation stage. Mature Technical Standards and Perfect Technical System, Overall Production. The industry is in the embryonic stage. Previous RFD market expectations. Breakthroughs have been made in the areas of logistics and retailing, but involvement of the industrial chain is too long which the industrial organization is too complex and the transaction whose cost is too high. The problems, such as too high, limited scale of industry, 2018 7th International Conference on Advanced Materials and Computer Science (ICAMCS 2018) Published by CSP © 2018 the Authors 245 whose difficulty in reducing cost and so on, make it difficult for us to do so. The overall market growth is relatively slow. The development of the national Internet of Things industry has great potential. accenture. Research shows that China can further expand the Internet of Things whose influence was directed investment and other similar schemes which is provided support to improve national capacity to absorb Internet of Things technologies. The industry will also generate tremendous added value which taking manufacturing industry as an example which promoted by China's current policies and investment trends in the future. In 15 years, the Internet of Things can create $196 billion in manufacturing. The cumulative GDP of RMB. If we further expand the shadow of the Internet of Things. The economic value of China's manufacturing industry will jump to 7360. Second, the policy-oriented impact on the development of the Internet of Things in China which is multidimensional policy input to promote the present stage. The strongest driving force for the development of China's Internet of Things industry. If it is to say country, the development of IOT industry belongs to the ""market-driven type"", domestic which is closer to the ""policy-driven"". Wenjia since August 2009.Internet of Things has been formalized since Premier Bao proposed ""Perception of China"". As one of the five emerging strategic industries in the country, it is written into ""politics"". Government Work Report "", Internet of Things in China by the whole society extreme great attention. After 2015, the Chinese government launched ""China"" manufacturing 2025 strategy to improve the competitiveness of manufacturing industry. ""In Made-in-China 2025 aims to transform China into a manufacturing power, China Improves China's Position in Global Manufacturing Value Chain. By integrating production processes with the Internet, manufacturing industry to become more environmentally friendly, intelligent and quality. In addition, the Chinese Government which is also pushing the ""Internet +"" strategy to integrate the mobile Internet. With the wide application of technology and intelligent technology, the Internet of Things will become the national promotion of information work. Policy support is expected to continue to increase. Thirdly, under the promotion of government policy, the Internet of Things in China is launched. Exhibitions follow from public management and service markets. To enterprises and industries application of Market and the way to Gradual Development of Individual Family Market is main goal. The concept of Internet of Things was put forward which is urgent to face it. Public management and service areas of demand are indicated by government applications. It will be necessary for Fan project to start the market of animal networking. Then, with the application of public management and service market, it will be solved. Continuous maturity of scheme, it enterprise agglomeration and technology integration. And gradually form a relatively complete industrial chain of the Internet of Things. Thus, it will be able to drive the application market of large enterprises in various industries. Fourth, the industrial system of the Internet of Things is relatively perfect, and the Internet of Thing with sensor industry agglomeration development effect highlights, in many industries. The development platform has been initially formed. Our country has formed covers perception. Manufacturing, Network Manufacturing, Software and Information Processing, Network and Response complete Internet of Things industry with services and other categories. The scale of industry continues to expand has formed around the Bohai Sea, Changsan. The spatial layout of the exhibition shows that the high-end elements are gathered and developed. Internet of Things Platform for Large Enterprises in Enterprise Development has basically taken shape. Small enterprises have joined the ecosphere of large enterprises in the situation of Lida Platform appears. With the application's landing and availability, the gradual accumulation of data mining, the value of the Internet of Things industry begins to appear. Internet of Things and the New is under the Leadership of Information Technology Enterprises in promoting the Cooperative Development of Technology, Innovating Enterprises and Innovating Products. Fifthly, the development of Internet of Things industry in China is still at the present stage which focus on technological breakthroughs, autonomous MEMS sensor products. industrialization are still the main development of Internet of Things industry. The rapid rise of emerging industries which is as such as the Internet of Things makes biography possible. Sensors are becoming more and more important in the world.

a7f0b278a3d38c4cace054bf424040f1bfbb4c88,A Model of Measuring and Predicting the Water Condition,"In this article, we mainly discuss the problem of water shortage and exhaustion and how to relieve it. A model is developed to measure and predict the water condition of a region and then an intervention plan is designed for the water scarcity region. Firstly, to build the model to measure the water supply ability of a region, “water supply capacity” is defined as the ratio of the total amount of water required to the amount of available water. We use Grey Predict Model, People Logistic Model, Auto Regressive Model and Cubic Spline Interpolation fitting method to predict the “water supply capacity”. Then we take Tianjin for example, the model result shows that the water supply ability of it is very poor, which agrees well with the reality. Secondly, we select the North China as study object where water overloaded in the given UN water scarcity map. After reading a large amount of relevant references, we give an opinion on why and how water is scarce in this region. Moreover, we use the above model to predict the water condition of North China in 15 years. We get that the amount of water required is stable while the amount of available water to be reduced. Thus water scarcity will more severe at the future. Thirdly, to fix the problem of water shortage, we design an intervention water saving plan. From the solving of the above model, we draw a conclusion that live water consumption and agricultural water consumption account for a large proportion. We apply Ramsey Pricing model to make optimal water price. And we change the way of irrigation from flood irrigation to sprinkling irrigation. Furthermore, according to the prediction, the water consumption is about 34.18123 billion cubic meters in 2137. But the total water resources predicted is 34.16923 billion cubic meters. Introduction As is known to all, water is the source of life. Thus the discussion on water has been continuously. We know that despite the fact that seventy percent of the earth‟s surface is covered with water, only a little part of it is fresh. The deep groundwater and ice solid water are difficult to explore with the limitation of technology. However, with the expansion of the population and development of the economy, the demand of clean water has increased rapidly (twice the rate of population). This type of scarcity is called Physical scarcity (the water in some regions cannot meet the need) .Physical scarcity and economic scarcity are two primary causes. In the developing country, there are about 1 billion people have no access to clean water and1.7 billion people have no good sanitation facilities. About 25 million people die from drinking unclear water each year. United Nations estimates that nearly half of the world‟s population will live in areas lacking water in 2025[1].The lack of sanitation facilities is one of economic scarcity, for example. Meanwhile, water pollution also contributes to the shortage.[2] Will the clean water be used up someday? How to improve the severe situation by taking measures? To answer these questions, we manage to finish the following work:  Develop a model to measure the water supply capacity of one region.  Elaborate the present situation of water shortage and explains the reason of the shortage in a water overloaded area from the Physical and Economical scarcity aspects.  Use the above model to predict the water situation of the picked region in 15 years and 7th International Conference on Education, Management, Computer and Medicine (EMCM 2016) Copyright © 2017, the Authors.
