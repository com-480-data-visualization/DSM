Purpose In this paper, we examine the history of the CS4All initiative and document the network of actors and their relationships in the system such that we can understand how this reform is enacted, how it might be reactive to external contexts and pressures, and how the structure and pathways of this particular social network might inform similar efforts elsewhere. Research Design To structure our analysis of CS4All, we first examine the most recent historic example of a large-scale curricular reform—Man: A Course of Study (MACOS). By reflecting on the network structure of CS4All in light of the design, enactment, and eventual failure of MACOS, we can identify potential pain points and opportunities in CS4All's 10-year effort. We conducted interviews with core members of the CS4All initiative and examined available public records to construct and analyze a social network of key CS4All stakeholders, other actors, processes, and institutions. Conclusions In our analysis of the CS4All social network, we document how well-connected individuals simultaneously mobilized government resources and grassroots enthusiasm to create the conditions necessary for the initiation of this massive curricular reform effort, and describe the current pathways in place for decision making and resource distribution. Comparing the history and structure of the CS4All initiative to Man: A Course of Study —a failed nationwide curricular reform in the 1960s—we find that CS4All's centralized decision-making process and failure to create and distribute high quality formative assessment tools may lead to challenges to adoption. However, explicit efforts to solicit input from and communicate initiative values to the large diversity of stakeholders throughout NYC, as well as the innovation of a decentralized “buffet-style” curricular approach, may put CS4All on more sure footing.",Teachers College Record,2020.0,1,"{'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/016146812012201106', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/016146812012201106?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/016146812012201106, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6021774f8fc59d289a8afb82a5047da315f4776c,The Impact of COVID-19 and “Emergency Remote Teaching” on the UK Computer Science Education Community,"The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed “emergency remote teaching” across education globally, leading to the closure of institutions across a variety of settings, from early-years through to higher education. This paper looks specifically at the impact of these changes to those teaching the discipline of computer science in the UK. Drawing on the quantitative and qualitative findings from a large-scale survey of the educational workforce (N=2,197) conducted in the immediate aftermath of institutional closures in March 2020 and the shift to online delivery, we report how those teaching computer science in various UK settings (n=214) show significantly more positive attitudes towards the move to online learning, teaching and assessment than those working in other disciplines; these perceptions were consistent across schools, colleges and higher education institutions. However, whilst practitioners noted the opportunities of these changes for their respective sector – especially a renewed focus on the importance of digital skills – they raised a number of generalisable concerns on the impact of this shift to online on their roles, their institutions and their sectors as a whole; for example, the impact on workload, effective pedagogy and job fragility. More specifically for computer science practitioners, curricula and qualifications, there were concerns raised regarding the ability to meaningfully deliver certain core topics such as mathematical foundations and programming, as well as the impact on various types of formal examinations and assessment. Based on the data obtained from this rapid response survey, we offer informed commentary, evaluation and recommendations for emerging learning and teaching policy and practice in the UK computer science community as we move into the 2020-2021 academic year and beyond.",UK & Ireland Computing Education Research Conference,2020.0,113,"{'url': 'https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa55012/Download/55012__17980__387760573b1f47ba8585a9e9122f579a.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3416465.3416472?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3416465.3416472, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0e9bc6793ef92fc38936cda3b17da6dde74ed240,Reinventing Evaluations with Competency Based Assessments: a Practical Experiment with Future Computer Science Engineers,"This innovative practice work-in-progress paper presents a pedagogical device, supported by a tool, moving evaluations at the heart of the learning process. The device gives back to students the control over their own learning and provides them with real-time feedback about their progress. Instructors can also monitor the progress of their classrooms.Designing a proper evaluation is not an easy task for instructors. It must make sense to students and should be adapted to the way they learn. Students are often quite afraid, stressed and not motivated by evaluations whose main perceived role is to achieve a decent grade to succeed the course. The method presented in this paper follows a competency based assessment approach. Each course’s objectives are described with a list of competencies to get. Students have to prove they master them by passing evaluations ranging from simple quizzes to projects, including missions, codings and oral interviews. Students can choose the assessments to work on, that best suit their own way of learning. They can present them at their own pace.The proposed pedagogical device and associated developed tool are being tested for the first time during this 2019–2020 academic year. It has been proposed to second-year bachelor to master computer science engineering students, on classrooms with between 17 and 34 people.

The study used descriptive approach. The study sample consisted of (159) male and female teachers chosen by the random stratified sample method from the study community represented by all science, mathematics and computer teachers in Ajloun Governorate in the academic year 2019/2020. The scale of requirements for applying the STEM approach and teachers’ attitudes towards it was developed; the validity and reliability of the study instrument were verified by appropriate statistical methods. Statistical processing was done using arithmetic means, and the analysis of multiple variance analysis. The results showed that the teachers ‘assessments of the requirements of the STEM approach are all high and above the hypothetical average (75%). “Changing the teaching methods” dimension came in the first place with an arithmetic mean (30, 29), followed by the dimension of “changing the learning goals” with an arithmetic mean (30.15). The third place was for “changing the vision and skills of teachers” dimension with an arithmetic mean (30.13), and the last place was for the domain of “changing the classroom environment” with an arithmetic mean (22.37). It showed that teachers’ attitudes toward STEM teaching are positive and high. And there were no statistically significant differences at the level (0.05) in the male and female teachers’ assessments of the requirements of STEM application and their attitudes towards it. On the other hand, there are statistically significant differences in their estimates according to the phase variable and in favor of the elementary stage.

92c99a3fff5b2114a8e38a26314737e7e25d92b6,Marine plastic debris in Indonesia: Baseline estimates (2010-2019) and monitoring strategies (2021-2025),"Indonesia set the mission to reduce marine plastic debris by 70% between 2018-2025 with a global significance to support the UN Sustainable Development Goal 14.1. This short communication assesses marine debris baseline estimates in Indonesia before 2020 from available contributions and provides recommendations for monitoring marine debris mitigation between 2021-2025. Widely ranging model estimates of plastic debris released into seas highlight the roles of data source, the spatial resolution of models, and in situ data to provide representative baseline values. Recognizing the strengths and uncertainties of available contributions, model outputs converge on a baseline value of 0.52 ± 0.36 million tons (Mt) per year prior to 2020 in Indonesia, therefore setting a targeted reduced number of 0.16 Mt of marine debris releases in 2025. The Indonesian Institute of Sciences showed a preliminary value of plastic debris accumulation in beaches at 113.58 ± 83.88 g/m2 monthly or equivalent to 0.40 Mt/year by assuming plastic debris is most pervasive within 3 meters from Indonesia’s 99,093 km-long coastlines. It is important to distinguish that while river monitoring data informs land-based plastic debris releases, stranded beach debris represents a fraction of debris that is not present in the water column and bottom sediments. Moving forward, monitoring initiatives to mitigate marine debris should leverage on nationwide municipality-level model estimates (e.g., the source to leakage route framework of the National Plastic Action Partnership) as well as in situ river and coastal particularly but not limited to sites co-identified in previous monitoring studies (i.e., Medan, Batam-Bintan, Padang, Jakarta-Seribu Islands, Semarang, Pontianak, Bali, Lombok, Makassar, Manado, Bitung). The latter should be conducted at least seasonally, considering evidence of monsoonal variations of marine debris release and accumulation in Indonesia.

Computational thinking has been acknowledged as a key aspect of engineering education and an intrinsic part of multiple ABET outcomes. However, computing is an area where some students have more privileges (e.g. access and exposure to meaningful use of computers) than others. Integrating computing into engineering, especially early in the curriculum, may exacerbate existing experiential disadvantages students from excluded social identities experience. Most introductory engineering programs have a component of programming and/or computational thinking. A comprehensive literature review showed that no existing computational thinking framework fully met the needs of students and professors in engineering and computer science. As a result, this team created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD). This diagnostic was assessed and improved during the 2019-2020 academic year. Data was collected from a cohort in a first-year engineering course that included topics in mathematics, engineering problem solving, and computation. Pre- and post-test data analysis with 62 participants documents statistically significant student growth in computational thinking in this course. Significant differences were not found by gender or a limited racially-based analysis. This diagnostic is of interest and relevance to all institutions providing engineering and computing programs. The short-term impact of this research includes an innovative approach to gauge student abilities in computational thinking early in a course in order to add appropriate intervention activities into lesson plans. The long-term impact is the creation of a measurement of student learning of computational thinking in engineering for courses and programs that wish to develop this important skill in their students.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2020.0,7,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274250?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274250, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c421c117e9b67b544e4a663a095b6a67e66970fe,On the Necessity of Flying and of not Flying: Exploring how Computer Scientists Reason about Academic Travel,"In order to fulfill the Paris agreement, we need to drastically reduce carbon emissions globally. 2020 is a pivotal year in this endeavour as many projections indicate that emissions need to decrease significantly before 2030. This challenge pertains to all parts of society, including (computer science) researchers. This however clashes with the fact that flying to a large extent has become built-in to the everyday practices of research and of academic life. It is feasible to imagine that computer scientists could fly less than other academics since we ought to be innovators and early adopters of computer-mediated alternatives such as video-conferencing and other forms of digital meeting technologies. It is however also possible that we fly more because conferences might be a more dominant outlet for publications in our field in comparison to other research fields. At KTH Royal Institute of Technology, the researchers at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) fly the most. In this paper, we present initial qualitative results from a survey regarding travel that was answered by computer scientists at EECS. We are in particular analysing the free text answers in order to understand how computer scientists1 reason about their own flying and about the alternatives. It will be hard to fulfil the Paris agreement without decreasing flying significantly, but this requires us to rethink how we do research, and how we travel (or not) within academia.

Thirty Canadian oat (Avena sativa L.) genotypes, grown in three Canadian growing locations (Brandon, Manitoba; Portage la Prairie, Manitoba; and Lacombe, Alberta) over 2 consecutive years (2020–2021), were analyzed. RESULTS Analysis of variance showed that the protein, total starch, and amylose content were significantly affected by genotype, environment, and their interaction. A principal component analysis bi‐plot illustrated that protein and total starch had an inverse relationship and were more affected by growing year, whereas amylose content had a negligible influence. The majority of genotypes were stable across environments but some genotypes, like CDC Morrison, were more influenced by different environments. Correlation analysis suggested that drought‐like conditions early in the growing season generated oat genotypes that favored the accumulation of protein, β‐glucan, and oil. CONCLUSION The results provide detailed information regarding the relationship between important oat chemical and physical traits and different growing environments, which can assist breeders to improve characteristics to obtain high‐quality oat grains and thus high‐quality end products. © 2025 His Majesty the King in Right of Canada and The Author(s).

To address this challenge, this study aims to strengthen evidence-based practice (EBP) in Malaysia through the integration of the TIME model (Transform, Innovate, Model, Enhancement) for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) public awareness for vital selfcare monitoring, particularly focusing on pulse monitoring and perfusion index (PI) as essential components of patient care. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, this research is grounded in the American Nurses Association’s (ANA, 2024) EBP model. The primary objectives of the study are: (1) to assess the factors influencing the implementation of various CPR practices and public health monitoring awareness, (2) to analyse the relationship between CPR approaches and public health monitoring awareness through statistical regression analysis, and (3) to develop an EBP practice guide for strategic CPR awareness. A comprehensive literature review utilizing databases such as OUM e-library, Science Direct, AHA, and ResearchGate provided insights from over 150 relevant sources. A mixed-methods design was applied, including quantitative data from surveys and qualitative data from open-ended questionnaires, with a sample of 200 final-year nursing students. Findings will inform the development of a recommended EBP model enhancement and strategic CPR guidelines, culminating in an eBook for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) public awareness for vital selfcare monitoring 2025-2030. The TIME model’s application in this context serves as a transformative and innovative framework that fosters best practices in CPR training and enhances public health awareness, on collaboration, patient-centred care, and the sustainability of health outcomes in Malaysia. focusing of Pulse Self-Monitoring for Public Awareness and CPR Readiness in Malaysia.",International journal of research and innovation in social science,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47772/ijriss.2025.9020194?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2025.9020194, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c0e1469a037caf2d23d8f697516f32d4e4de3030,A Five-Year Retrospective on an Applied Baccalaureate Program in Software Development,"This experience report documents an intervention that started five years ago, in 2014. Green River College, a community college in a suburb of Seattle, Washington, launched a new applied baccalaureate program in Software Development, with a goal of preparing place-bound, underrepresented, and underserved students for employment as entry-level software developers. At program inception, community college baccalaureate degrees were relatively new across the nation and there was little precedent established in terms of program design, particularly as these new degree programs were not intended to emulate traditional undergraduate Computer Science programs, but rather provide an alternative pathway to the baccalaureate and workforce. The Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) in Software Development is designed as a ""2+2"" program, where students enter the program at third-year/junior-level standing after completing their two-year applied associate degree. The BAS Software Development curriculum includes courses in both ""computer science fundamentals"" and industry-focused, project-based learning courses. Since program inception, the curriculum has evolved based on evidence and feedback from students, instructors, alumni, and industry partners. Initial key results at the five-year mark include a review of enrollment, completion, diversity, and placement data. As of June 2019, the program has 132 graduates (degrees conferred), with 52 new students on track to enter the program in the 2019-2020 academic year. A recent snapshot of currently enrolled students indicates the median age is 24, 23% are women, 40% are students of color, 39% are first generation college students, and 40% are receiving need-based financial aid.

812631162357332f55ab6e0750435c8a2089b610,Paradigm Shift from Conventional to Virtual Surgery Using Three-dimensional Model of Fibula as Preoperative Planning and Guide Technique in Mandibular Reconstruction in Oral Carcinoma: A Prospective Multicentric Comparative Study,"
 
 
 Mandibular reconstruction using a free fibula osseocutaneous flap is a commonly performed and well-established technique accepted worldwide, as the postoperative restoration of form and function of the oral cavity and facial features is superior compared to pedicled flaps. However, this requires precise preoperative planning, followed by execution to correctly restore the loss caused by the complex defect created after the surgical extirpation. With the incorporation of virtual surgical planning (VSP) and computer-assisted design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) techniques in medical science, their incorporation as preoperative tools holds a lot of promise for a better surgical outcome.
 
 
 
 The aim of study was to assess the utility and benefits of VSP using CAD/CAM techniques over preexisting preoperative planning methods for mandibular reconstruction using a free fibular flap.
 
 
 
 A multicentric prospective comparative study was carried out at two tertiary care hospitals of the Armed Forces. Two-year data were collected from October 2020 to October 2022. A total of 39 consecutive cases of oral carcinoma requiring mandibular reconstruction using a free fibular flap were included in the study. Nineteen cases underwent free fibula flap reconstruction using already established preoperative planning in one center, whereas 20 cases underwent VSP as a preoperative tool in another center. The primary objectives assessed were the operative time and intraoperative blood loss in each arm. The secondary objectives assessed were the incidence of flap loss, the presence of oral incompetence postsurgery, the total hospital stay, and the presence of facial symmetry.
 
 
 
 The total flap harvest time in the VSP group (68 min ± 13 standard deviation [SD]) was lower than that in the control group (88 min ± 14 SD), which was statistically significant (P < 0.001). There was no statistical difference in total operative time (P = 0.06), although in the VSP group, the mean was 10.6 h ± 1.5 SD as opposed to 11.5 h ± 1.6 SD in the control group. Nearly 26.3% of cases in the control group, as compared to 10.5% in the VSP group, had flap-related complications. In the early postoperative period, oral competence was achieved in 94.7% of cases (18/20) in the VSP group as opposed to 68.4% (13/19) in the conventional arm, which was statistically significant (P = 0.04). The mean overall hospital stay was higher in the VSP group (7.1 weeks ± SD) compared to the conventional group (4.4 weeks ± 0.9 SD), which was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Nearly 73.7% (14/20) of cases in the VSP group were satisfied with their facial symmetry, compared to 63.2% (12/19) in the conventional group in the postoperative rehabilitation phase. However, this was not statistically significant (P < 0.48).
 
 
 
 This index multicentric study carried out in two tertiary care hospitals of the Armed Forces Medical Services, where this emerging technology was adopted as its test arm to prove a better postoperative outcome, may have exhibited equivocal results so far, but it is encouraging results, although not proven statistically significant, hold lots of promises for the future.

The emphasis of synthetic biology is discovery, application, and automation of processes to find solutions to problems in a variety of sectors, including medicine, energy, and the environment. In this column, I discuss the 20-year roadmap of research priorities in synthetic biology, released by the EBRC in 2019. The 20-year synthetic biology roadmap (EBRC, 2019) was developed by 80 leading scientists and engineers in this emerging research field. The first of its kind, the roadmapwas funded by the National Science Foundation to build on the success of biotechnology and position the United States as a leader in a bio-based economy. The audience for the roadmap includes scientists, engineers, and policy makers. However, nurse scientists, particularly those whose programs of research focus on system biology, could be crucial members of these engineering biology research teams (Founds, 2009). The report is built around a model that, at its core, describes the engineering process: design, build, test, and learn (EBRC, 2020). This approach uses technical approaches identified in themodel, including “1) gene editing, synthesis, and assembly; 2) biomolecule, pathway, and circuit engineering; 3) host and consortia engineering; and 4) data integration, modeling, and automation” (EBRC, 2019, p. 12). The roadmap categorizes progress needed in each of the technical approaches at 2, 5, 10, and 20 years to solve real problems in health and medicine, food and agriculture, environmental biotechnology, industrial biotechnology, and energy.",Nursing Education Perspectives,2020.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1097/01.NEP.0000000000000698?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1097/01.NEP.0000000000000698, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Conducted actions by the International Consortium on Landslides (ICL) reflect priorities and challenges at different scales with regard to the progress of multi-sectoral partnerships, recognising the key role of the STC for the implementation of the SFDRR. Central to such endeavour are the Sendai Landslide Partnerships 2015–2025 and the new-fangled Kyoto Landslide Commitment 2020. While the former was conceived as a strategy for global promotion of understanding and reducing landslide disaster risk, the latter is directed to advocate for harmonic cohesiveness between the Sendai Landslide Partnerships 2015–2025, and the SFDRR, the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals, the New Urban Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement. By encompassing the linkages of the contributions of the ICL community to the expected outcomes of the STR-SFDRR, this paper provides valuable input to foster the SFDRR, and provides concrete information on the ongoing ICL initiatives, actions and deliverables for strengthening partnerships and science-informed public policies to reduce landslide disaster risk and to advance Integrated Landslide Disaster Risk Management at different scales.",Landslides,2020.0,9,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10346-020-01539-8.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7500253, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In economics, the primary focus has always been on studying how it affects the market, determining reasons behinds its price fluctuations, and predicting its future prices. In computer science, the focus is on its vulnerabilities, scalability, and other techno-cryptoeconomic issues. Firstly, we are going to collect the historical data of Bitcoin prices over the years 2013 to 2019 and do prediction for the year 2020.

150786d8bc12b52ded2a157fde7da2c62f1e5d7b,Reflections in reproductive medicine 2020: windows of opportunity lost and found,"For most, 2020 will be a year to remember for all that has gone wrong. Before the coronavirus disease outbreak early this year (COVID-19), the last vestiges of what meetings were supposed to be came to an abrupt halt by summer, despite futile efforts to jumpstart the many conferences already embedded in the calendar. No more meetings of the non-virtual variety would materialize for the remainder of the year. And the dawning of the ZOOM era soon brought forth our collective veiled efforts to retain or reestablish the meeting experience by sitting in front of a computer monitor for hours on end, much to the chagrin of conference sponsors and organizers wishing for something a bit more interactive. This one dimension of science as we knew it changed in the year 2020, as did so much else! Reflecting back on a year that has turned out to be about as eventful as one could imagine is entirely appropriate at this juncture. Evenwith vaccines on the horizon, the world entered and persists in an altered state, while the fragile nature of our species retains center stage as SARS CoV-2 pushed the tenets and substance of the modern contemporary biomedical enterprise to its limits. Despite the accrued technological bravado thought to have had a global coalition to draw strength from, the so-called scientific meritocracy came crashing down for countries like the USA in response to the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic. For our specialized community of reproductive medicine and biology, a mixed bag of outcomes has obtained in human ARTs and reproductive genetics due to the repositioning and adaptation of our specialty against a backdrop of safety and patient care commanded by the COVID era. Practicing social distancing, respectfully quarantining as need be, and following whatever precautions and directives coming from our professional societies, despite delays, our patients eventually got back on the tread mill to pregnancy in most IVF clinics. And the basic science and clinical research in our discipline continued to strike tones of progress like few other years before the COVID-19 pandemic. For journal editors, the spike in submissions witnessed this year is but one sentinel of how the change in lifestyle affected the world of science, for the better we hope. And possibly one of the brightest notes struck this year in the world of science was the announcement of the Nobel prize for chemistry being awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna for their groundbreaking discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing machinery [1]. How their seminal work and the broader implications of gene editing for the future of reproductive medicine will impact our field is the topic tackled in the commentary by Pavlovic and colleagues in this month’s issue (Altered evolution: are reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialists ready for the genetically engineered future? https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815020-01963). Having the difficult conversations bridging the potential interplay between gene editing and the field of ARTs is only a matter of time as science and society begin to forge a new alliance in the face of the troublesome year endured by the hopeful and hopeless alike. Saltations of the do this and do not do that ilk have sprinkled the ART agenda in 2020 just as has been the case throughout its history. For example, a foundational principle of our efforts to send patients home with a child has always aimed at understanding the role of the uterine endometrium in time and space for the process of implantation.

9e6c86a3f41d8bad4cdb5f6399383b7365d5f94e,Information Mining for COVID-19 Research From a Large Volume of Scientific Literature,"The year 2020 has seen an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic due to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus in 180 countries. In a desperate effort to discover new drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, many scientists are working around the clock. Their valuable time and effort may benefit from computer-based mining of a large volume of health science literature that is a treasure trove of information. In this paper, we have developed a graph-based model using abstracts of 10,683 scientific articles to find key information on three topics: transmission, drug types, and genome research related to coronavirus. A subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more topic-focused information. Within each subgraph, we use a betweenness centrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to drugs, diseases, pathogens, hosts of pathogens, and biomolecules. The results reveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Amantadine, Dexamethasone), pathogen-hosts (pigs, bats, macaque, cynomolgus), viral pathogens (zika, dengue, malaria, and several viruses in the coronaviridae virus family), and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms (oligonucleotide, interferon, glycoprotein) in connection with the core topic of coronavirus. The categorical summary of these keywords and topics may be a useful reference to expedite and recommend new and alternative directions for COVID-19 research.",arXiv.org,2020.0,32,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02085, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

bcaeea78a8bd76073b61b18af76f366e99e81411,Awareness and practice of computer-related ergonomics among resident doctors,"The present study was designed to see the level of awareness and practice of computer-related ergonomics among resident doctors. A total of 227 residents participated in this study who had used a computer for at least a year. They were selected by simple random sampling. A selfreporting questionnaire was used to conduct the study. For better understanding and convenience, the responses were categorized into good, fair, and poor. Awareness level was good in only 15% (n= 34) of residents, fair in 16.7% and the majority 68.3% (n= 155) of residents had a poor level of awareness about ergonomics. Poor computer ergonomics was practiced by 49.5% of residents, while fare and good practice of computer ergonomics were found in 24.2% and 26% of residents respectively. The formal training program on computer ergonomics was unattended by 93.5% of participant residents. In graduation/postgraduation level 81.5% of residents didn’t get any lecture on correct posture. To measure the practice of computer ergonomics, we found that 64.3% of residents didn’t take breaks regularly while using a computer, 69.2% didn't use an adjustable chair and 59% didn't have armrests in those chairs. Proper positioning of knee, elbow, and wrist during computer use wasn't maintained by 56.8%, 58.1%, and 44.9% of residents respectively. A significant association was found between awareness and resident phase with computer practice (p<0.005) and sex with awareness (p<0.005).

Only 25.5% in Nigeria and 28.7% in Pakistan in the medical profession were seen to be aware of ergonomics 13, 14 Unfortunately, to date there is no data available on this topic among the physician community of Bangladesh. Among all physicians, resident doctors have an incomparable position because they have to play a dual role of being a clinician and a student at the same time.15 In this context, the present study was designed to see the level of awareness regarding computer ergonomics and the pattern of practice of computer ergonomics among resident doctors. Materials and Methods The study was performed from March 2015 to September 2016 among the 227 resident doctors (142 males, 85 females; age range 26-42 years) of Phase-A (n=103) and Phase-B (n=124) of three faculties who used desktop/laptop computer for at least one year. Two hundred were Bangladeshi and the rest of them were foreign residents. Residents were selected irrespective of age, sex, and nationality by simple random sampling calculated using Cochran's (1977) sample size formula for a sufficiently large population. Residents who had any physical disability which prevented him/her from practicing computer ergonomics, who had a history of fractures or major trauma, inflammatory rheumatic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathy and any systemic illness were excluded from this study. A structured, close-ended, investigator-developed, self-reporting questionnaire was used to conduct the study. The questionnaire was prepared based on previous studies on ergonomics, theory, a standard questionnaire on computer ergonomics (Easy ergonomics: For desktop computer users, 2005).8,14,16 -18 The questionnaire was divided into three segments: general information about participant residents, awareness of computer ergonomics, and practice of computer ergonomics. In the study, the level of awareness and practice of computer ergonomics were judged by categorizing awareness and practice of ergonomics into 3 categories: good, fair, and poor. Resident doctors answered some questions in the individual section on the awareness and practice of computer ergonomics. Answering a section resulted in some scoring points according to the Likert scale. Then summation of these scores culminated in a category (Good/fair/poor) of that section.19, 20 All the data were compiled and sorted properly and the data were analyzed statistically by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (Version20). The Chi-square test was used to determine the association between categorical variables and computer-related variables with awareness and practice of study participants.",,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3329/bsmmuj.v13i2.47605', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3329/bsmmuj.v13i2.47605?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3329/bsmmuj.v13i2.47605, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

eeb5fe5df43154184c2bf84f5f6e2b12e1849291,Effect of 24 weeks of KAATSU resistance training on femoral muscle size and safety in a 84-year-old woman.,"Objective] It is well known that KAATSU resistance training can produce muscle hypertrophy without deteriorating cardiovascular system in older adults. However, it is unclear whether KAATSU resistance training exceeding 12 weeks were a highly safe and effective training method for improvement of skeletal muscle mass in older adults. We examined effect of 24 weeks of KAATSU resistance training on femoral muscle size and its safety for older adult. [Methods] The subject was an 84-year-old woman (standing height 153 cm and body weight 46 kg). The KAATSU resistance training was provided for a total of 48 sessions over 24 weeks. Training intensity and volume were set at 20% or 30% of one-repetition maximum (1-RM) and 75 repetitions for knee extension and leg press exercises, respectively. Mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured by MRI scan before, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the training. The maximal strength, chair-stand test, hemodynamic parameters, arterial stiffness, coagulation system and muscle damage were also measured. [Results] Quadriceps muscle CSA, 1-RM strength and chair-stand test increased throughout 24week training period. On the other hand, there were no changes in body weight, hemodynamic parameters (except for systolic blood pressure), arterial compliance coagulation system and muscle damage throughout the training period. [Conclusion] The 24 weeks of KAATSU resistance training may be a highly safe and effective training method for improvement of skeletal muscle mass in older adults.

Subject A 84-year-old woman (standing height, 153 cm) participated in this study. She had no participated in resistance-type training prior to the study, and was free of overt chronic disease as assessed by medical history, physical examination, and complete chemistry and hematologic evaluation. The principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and the American College of Sports Medicine Guidelines for USE of Human Subjects were adopted in this study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee, and informed consent were obtained from the subject. 3. Methods The subject performed bilateral knee extension and leg press exercise training 2 days/week for 24 weeks. This training was performed under the close supervision of those with technical knowledge in BFR training. Three or four days before training, the subject performed one-repetition maximum (1-RM) test, which was estimated by the 10-RM method. Training intensity and volume were set at 20% or 30% of 1-RM and 75 repetitions for knee extension and leg press exercises, respectively. This protocol is typical of submaximal BFR studies. During knee extension and leg press exercises, the subject was seated comfortably on isotonic knee extension (VR1, Cybex International, Inc.) and leg press machines (Seated Leg Press, Life Fitness), with the body supported in a vertical position. The training loads of each exercise was adjusted based on estimated 1-RM testing performed every 3 weeks. During the training sessions, the subject wore a specially designed elastic pressure cuff (50 mm width, KAATSU Master, Sato Sports Plaza, Tokyo, Japan) around the most proximal portion of the both legs. On the first day of training, the cuff was set at 120 S.K.U. The pressure was increased by 10-20 S.K.U. at each subsequent training session until a pressure of approximately 200 S.K.U. was reached. Immediately after the exercise session, the pressure cuff was quickly removed. The subject testing took place before the start of the study (pre), 3-5 days after the 12-week and 24-week of training. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was obtained using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner (1.5-T MRI, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). A T-1 weighted spin-echo axial plane sequence was performed with a 540-msec repetition time and a 20-msec echo time. Subjects rested quietly in the magnet bore in a supine position with their legs extended. Continuous transverse images (10-mm slice thickness) were transferred to a personal computer for analysis using specially designed image analysis software (sliceOmatic, Tomovision Inc., QC, Canada). CSA data for the quadriceps, adductors and hamstrings at 50% of thigh length and for the Gluteus maximus at the top edge of the great trochanter were digitized. Bilateral knee extension and leg press maximum dynamic strength (1-RM) were assessed using an isotonic knee extension and leg press machines. During estimated 1-RM testing as well as training sessions, the parallel leg stance width was set at 100% of the shoulder-width for leg press exercises. A chair-stand test required participants to stand up from a seated position, as many times as possible, within 30 seconds. Hemodynamic parameter, cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) were measured noninvasively using a VS-1500 system (Fukuda Denshi Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). CAVI and ABI were obtained by substituting the stiffness parameter into an equation for determining vascular elasticity. Venous blood samples were obtained from the antecubital vein and measured for fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), D-dimer and creatine kinase (CK). The plasma concentrations of these samples were measured at a commercial laboratory (SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan) by following latex immunoassay (LIA) for fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer and spectrophotometry for NADPH formed by a hexokinase and D-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-coupled enzymic system for CK. 4. Results After 24-week training period, quadriceps and adductors muscle CSA (14% and 9%), knee extension and leg press 1-RM (43% and 60%) and chair-stand performance (29%) showed marked increase. In particular, quadriceps muscle CSA, both 1-RM strength and chair-stand test increased throughout 24-week training period. On the other hand, there were no changes in body weight, hemodynamic parameters (except for systolic blood pressure), arterial stiffness, coagulation system and muscle damage throughout the training period (Table 1). 5. Discussion The main findings of the present study were: (1) 24week KAATSU resistance training can lead to increase in muscle CSA as well as maximal strength for older adult, (2) hemodynamic parameters, arterial stiffness, coagulation factors, and CK, a marker of muscle damage were not changed throughout the training period. Our results showed that KAATSU resistance training produced a hypertrophic potential of 0.31% and 0.28% per session in quadriceps muscle CSA (for 12and 24-weeks, respectively), which is similar to that observed following high-intensity resistance training at 80% 1-RM (0.26%-0.45%) in elderly adults. Additionally, the observed gains in knee extension (1.39% and 0.88% per session for 12and 24-weeks, respectively) and leg press 1-RM strength (1.60% and 1.25% per session for 12and 24-weeks, respectively) were comparable with the previous KAATSU study at 20% 1-RM (knee extension: 1.06%, leg press: 1.07% per session, respectively). Therefore, our data suggested that KAATSU resistance training (at 20-30% 1-RM) can provide an effective hypertrophic stimulus on thigh muscles for long-period in older adults. CW6_A2051D02.indd 2 2020/03/05 16:23:08 3 Tomohiro Yasuda, Kazuya Fukumura, Toshiaki Nakajima In this study, maximum heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion during each KAATSU resistance exercise (100-155 BPM and 15-19, respectively; data not shown) were not low level compared with previous KAATSU training studies for older adults. However, hemodynamic parameters (heart rate and blood pressure), arterial stiffness (CAVI), coagulation factors (FDP and d-dimer), and muscle damage (CK) were not changed throughout the training period. Thus, it appears that these KAATSU resistance exercises were a highly safe and effective training method even if the older adults feel with sufficiently hard training protocol. However, it should be noted that the possibility of side effects cannot be denied when subjects perform such training until near exhaustion or particularly to complete exhaustion. Additional research is needed to understand the relationship between the long-period of KAATSU resistance training and muscle hypertrophy/ safety for many older adults. In conclusion, 24 weeks of KAATSU resistance training were a highly safe and effective training method for improvement of skeletal muscle mass in older adult. Thus, the long-period intervention by KAATSU resistance training may be considered as a useful way to prolong the healthy life expectancy in older adults.

Therefore, there is a need to identify and address the factors affecting the academic performance of Undergraduates in Sri Lankan universities.  A survey designed was employed with questionnaires administered to the third year undergraduates of the Faculty of Science, Eastern University, Sri Lanka. The questionnaire covered the socio-economic factors, academic performances of the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Examinations in schools, extra studies of computer courses and English, extra-curricular activities and family backgrounds. The Grade Point Average for the first and second year of studies was used as the responses for the academic performance. The study revealed that gender, mother language, academic grades obtained for English language and general English at the GCE examinations, the stream of study of the degree programme in the University, the number of attempt at the GCE examination to enter the university were the mostly influencing factors.

b501e7ee0a7f62a2f411a0dc084829755ccaabef,Virtual Summit: Incorporating Data Science and Open Science in Aquatic Research,"BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW We can all likely agree that 2020 is a year of change, both in personal as well as professional lives. While it is easy to dwell on the negatives, the year has been ripe with creative and entrepreneurial opportunities to embrace new forms of sharing science. In particular, virtual conferences and summits have opened a space where researchers, students, and curious individuals across the globe can engage in open discourse. In doing so, the increasing availability and popularity of online conferences have enabled scientific communities not only to connect in a time when in-person meetings are not possible, but also to overcome barriers to participation that have long existed, such as travel and registration fees. With these needs and opportunities in mind, a grassroots group of scientists convened for the first “Virtual Summit: Incorporating Data Science and Open Science in Aquatic Research” from 23 through 24 July 2020. For those who may be curious but less familiar, data science combines mathematics and statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to enable insight for problems that are otherwise too computationally demanding or data-intensive to be analyzed with traditional tools (Hayashi 1998). Open science is the practice of making tools that enable transparency into scientific design, analysis, and reporting, such that future researchers—and curious individuals in general—can access and reproduce others’ work (Bartling and Friesike 2014). Together, data science and open science techniques allow aquatic researchers to tackle complex aquatic problems while increasing scientific transparency and efficiency between researchers and stakeholders. By bringing together speakers who practice data science and open science techniques, this virtual summit was intended to showcase how limnologists and oceanographers work with big data, expand modeling frameworks, develop tools and software for the larger community, and inform natural resource management and monitoring. The virtual summit featured 18 prerecorded presentations split across two, 3-h sessions on successive days. There were also live question and answer sessions immediately following the presentations. The talks were divided into four main themes: (1) Big Data, (2) Data-Intensive Models, (3) Tools and Software, and (4) Applications of Open Science. While many of the presentations incorporated multiple themes, we broadly grouped talks such that the first day of the virtual summit pertained mostly to “Data Science,” and the second day centered around “Open Science” topics (Fig. 1). Following presentations on July 24, breakout groups paralleling the summit’s four themes allowed for participants and presenters to discuss certain data science and open science topics in a more casual setting.",Limnology and Oceanography Bulletin,2020.0,6,"{'url': 'https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/lob.10411', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/lob.10411?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/lob.10411, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4592c73cad82585eb4384a4a8e7692f8dae23736,"Preface to Volume 2020, Issue 1","IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology (ToSC) is a forum for original results in all areas of symmetric cryptography, including the design and analysis of block ciphers, stream ciphers, encryption schemes, hash functions, message authentication codes, (cryptographic) permutations, authenticated encryption schemes, cryptanalysis and evaluation tools, and security issues and solutions regarding their implementation. ToSC implements an open-access journal/conference hybrid model following some other communities in computer science. All articles undergo a journal-style reviewing process and accepted papers are published in gold open access (in our case the Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0). The review procedures that we have followed strictly adhere to the traditions of the journal world. Full papers are assigned to the members of the Editorial Board. These members write detailed and careful reviews (usually without relying on subreviewers). Moreover, we have had a rebuttal phase, allowing authors to respond to the review comments before the final decisions. If necessary, the review process enables further interactions between the authors and the reviewers, mediated by the Co-Editors-in-Chief. Detailed discussions among the reviewers lead to one of the following four decisions for each paper: accept, in which case the authors submit their final camera-ready manuscript after editorial corrections; accept with minor revision, which means that the authors revise their manuscript and go through one or more iterations and reviews of the manuscript until the comments have been addressed in a satisfactory way; major revision, which means that the authors are requested to make major changes to their manuscript before submitting again in one of the next rounds; and reject, which means that the manuscript is deemed to be not suitable for publication in ToSC. The review process shares with the high quality conferences that it is double-blind and adheres to a strict timing; but unlike a traditional conference, there are multiple submission deadlines per year. Most papers are notified of the decision two months after submission, but the decision can be deferred for long papers. This year, we received a few very long papers, and we decided to experiment with a new procedure where we first ask reviewers to judge whether the length is justified by the scientific contribution, and we only proceeded with the scientific review in a second phase. Each paper received at least three reviews; for submissions by Editorial Board members this was increased to at least four. Overall, we are very pleased with the quality and quantity of submissions, the detailed review reports written by the reviewers and the substantial efforts by the authors to further improve the quality of their work. We think that the review process, and in particular the use of major revisions, leads to an increased quality of the papers that are published. The papers selected by the Editorial Board for publication are presented at the conference Fast Software Encryption (FSE). This gives the authors the opportunity to advertise their results and engage in discussions on further work. In 2020, FSE was originally scheduled for March 22-26, 2020 in Athens, Greece. However, the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 led to travel restrictions and social distancing measures in many countries. In early March, the Greek Health Ministry decided to suspend all conference",IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.46586/tosc.v2020.i1.1-5', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.13154/tosc.v2020.i1.1-5?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.13154/tosc.v2020.i1.1-5, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d2dacf28f4698ef817a693e92df93a45b1961e09,Memorial of F. Donald Bloss 1920–2020,"May 30, 2020: As I compose this memorial to one of the giants in our field, today would have been the century mark for F. Donald (Don) Bloss. Sadly, Don passed away April 22, 2020, in Blacksburg, Virginia. Don died peacefully in his sleep of age-related health issues, his wife of 74 years and his youngest daughter by his side. Don is survived by his wife Louise and three daughters, Terry, Janet, and Jill. He was preceded in death by one son, Donald Bloss, who sadly died at the too-young age of three. Don was born and educated in Chicago, receiving his BS (’47) and MS (’49) in Geology and Ph.D. (’51) in Mineralogy from the University of Chicago. Don had started at the University in 1939 as an English major who was also on the football team. He changed his major to geology after taking a required science elective from J Harlen Bretz of Channeled Scablands fame; also as the university dropped its football program. And like many current college students he had a gap year, well several, as he was called away like many of his generation (i.e., the Greatest Generation) to serve in World War II—more on this later. After completing his Ph.D. Don accepted a faculty position at the University of Tennessee in 1951, leaving there in 1957 for Southern Illinois University. He finally left SIU in 1967 for VPI, now better known as Virginia Tech, where he would spend the rest of his career. He ultimately became the first Alumni Distinguished Professor in 1972 and then Emeritus in 1991. Don is best known to the mineralogical world by his textbooks, but he was also a dedicated family man, both personally and professionally. Of course, there was also the wit! The integration of books, family, and wit is seen in his book dedications. His first book An Introduction to the Methods of Optical Crystallography (1961) was dedicated to his wife Louise, as was the second edition Optical Crystallography (1999). His second book Crystallography and Crystal Chemistry (1971) was dedicated “To my daughters, Terry, Janet, and Jill, in order of appearance.” His final scientific book was The Spindle Stage: Principles and Practice (1981) and is dedicated to “Mn9(SiO4)4(OH)2 (aka “Chips”).” There’s really a name where the chemical formula is of a gentleman who was one of Don’s first graduate students, who also served on the USS Missouri as a carpenter (thus the “Chips”). His last book WWII, Mineralogy, and Me: A Memoir (2012) was “For my students (who often taught me).” The memoir contains more words than his optical crystallography book and was heavily influenced by one of Don’s favorite authors and storytellers—Mark Twain. It’s available on the MSA website, as are all of Don’s aforementioned books. It is worth reading, as it gives a sense of a different time, while learning both American history (e.g., there’s a section titled “Cuddling up to the atomic bomb”), early geology theories [e.g., the section on “J (no period) Harlen Bretz”], and mineralogy (e.g., the “Blacksburg Mafia”). Needless to say, these titles also give more hints as to his wit. On a more serious note, he also discusses his role in a medical military unit stationed in England during WWII as a conscientious objector. Most would not guess that Don’s first research publication in 1949 dealt with Yellowstone geysers (Bloss and Barth 1949). Yes, we geologists were a bit more diverse in our research back then! Also, most geologists are taught that quartz does not have cleavage, but perhaps they should read Bloss and Gibbs (1963) to find that not to be the case. There is also an interesting story with that publication that Don once told me; the only equipment they had was a polarizing light microscope (PLM) equipped with a U-stage, a mortar, and a pestle. So, they broke quartz grains and measured their c-axis inclinations. Don’s major research accomplishments really started when he begun refining and developing new methods for collection of optical data with a spindle-stage-equipped PLM. These efforts revolved (pun intended) around the spindle stage—a one axis rotation device that mounts on a PLM with its rotation axis perpendicular to the light path. One of the first accomplishments was to develop computational methods to orient a biaxial crystal based on simple measurements (Bloss and Riess 1973). He continued this work culminating in the computer program EXCALIBR and applications described in his MSA Presidential Address (Bloss 1978). This was followed shortly by a textbook describing these newer, refined spindle stage methods (Bloss 1981).

The course, provided to first-year Computer Science students, introduces a rigorous methodology to write programs using Loop Invariants, recursion, and basic data structures such as Files, Lists, Queues, and Stacks. In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a lock-down in our country. The universities decided to fully switch to remote teaching. As the exercises sessions previously consisted of solving problems on a blackboard, we had to design in a hurry course materials that would cope with remote teaching. Instead of giving students yet another podcast in their course schedule, we gave them homework exercises, we called GameCode, that they could do at their own convenience. These exercises are inspired by GameBooks in which the reader can choose the path she takes to complete the story. With GameCode, students can choose their own solving path for each exercise.

cdaeefa2a0980b41a78a37227ad26fe25ebce4bc,Unveiling the Disability A Study of Social Discrimination in Contemporary American Memoires,"The study aims to explore social discrimination as experienced by disabled persons and depicted in contemporary American memoirs by the disabled person. It investigates the effects of stigmatization and negative stereotypes as experienced by disabled persons in their memoirs, which further trigger social discrimination in contemporary societies. By examining these memoirs, the research aims to shed light on the societal challenges faced by disabled persons and contribute to a broader understanding of disability in the social context, with special reference to “Haben: The Deafblind Woman Who Conquered Harward Law” by Haben Girma (2019). The research is carried out according to the theoretical perspectives of Dr. Dana S. Dunn (2015) by employing the “Qualitative Textual Analysis Technique”. The study reveals that negative stereotypes, attitudes, and stigmatization often result in social discrimination of disabled persons. Social discrimination further leads to psychological discrimination despite various anti-discrimination laws enforced for decades in the United States. It also sheds light on the measures taken by disabled persons to overcome the negative impacts of social discrimination in practical life.

The article presents the results of the analysis of the current state of implementation of ICT in the educational process of institutions of general secondary education in Ukraine. For this purpose, a survey was conducted among students of the ﬁrst year of the Zhytomyr Polytechnic State University of 2019 and 2020 years of admission, within which 17 questions were asked to students related to the use of information and communication technologies in the educational process. As a result of the research, the introduction of the discipline “Educational technologies and digital education” into the training of future information technology specialists was substantiated, as well as the certiﬁcation educational program “Information systems and cloud technologies in the educational process”, designed for general education teachers, educators for higher education institutions, experts in the ﬁeld of additional educational services, and other professionals. Besides, the course “Application Packages” for specialties 121 “Software Engineering”, 122 “Computer Science”, 123 “Computer Engineering”, 125 “Cybersecurity” and 126 “Information Systems and Technologies” at the Zhytomyr Polytechnic State University has been expanded for study some cloud services that can serve as an alternative to the usual MS Ofﬁce.

cb623310fdd36f5077af6595b25c89e7713fdb7c,Tie-breaking methodology for the assessment of science olympiad events,"Science Olympiad events are annually conducted competitions that cover a variety of science disciplines spanning biology, earth science, chemistry, physics, engineering, and technology. Each event addresses the knowledge of science concepts, as well as the application of these concepts, along with the necessary process skills to participate in the National Science Olympiad Tournament at the end of May of each year. In 2019, the meteorology event was conducted in Division B (Middle Schools). Fifty questions were prepared before the events in the North Dakota state competition to cover topics ranging from the Earth’s modern atmosphere to weather forecasting and temperature indices. The North Dakota Meteorology event facilitators used the Turning Technologies’ student response system to automate the scoring to minimize manual grading error and to eliminate any ties in score consistently for all competitors. Breaking multiple ties by manual grading is a difficult task considering that the scores need to be turned in as soon as the tests end. Additionally, the Olympic rules do not allow any ties and ask the event facilitators to turn in the score sheets with each team awarded unique scores. In other words, the facilitators are expected to come up with their own way to resolve the ties, leading to inconsistencies in methodologies among the events. This paper focuses on breaking ties based on the difficulty level of a question in such a way that the more difficult the question is, the more points are awarded for the team in an automated fashion. The authors believe that the method described here is a simple but useful method that will save the facilitators time and provide an error-free, and most importantly a consistent grading system that is designed to eliminate the tie of scores among the competing teams. Furthermore, the tie-breaking methodology described in this paper and the publicly available score sheet, which could be adapted for use even if one does not have Turning Points technology, have the potential to lead to more consistent scoring in any of the Science Olympiad events across the country. 1 Corresponding Author: F.

Background on Science Olympiads The Science Olympiad is a US non-profit organization with the goal of increasing K-12 student interest in the sciences through teamwork and by providing recognition for achievements by both students and their teachers. Otto (2010) suggests that the National Science Olympiad is an attempt to involve the students in competitive events in science to turn students onto science. Wirt (2011) analyzed the Science Olympiad survey database to show that the Science Olympiad had an impact on career choices. Based on the study, 89 students out of 635 surveyed said yes to the question asking whether the Science Olympiad led to a career. Of the 89 who said yes, one student selected meteorology as a career. Literatures cite many articles published on Science Olympiad as a whole, but there are only a few talks about the meteorology event, and none puts explicit emphasis on assessment of the meteorology event such as this paper. The Science Olympiad competitions consist of a collection of 23 various team events presented at local, state, and national interscholastic competitions. These events cover a variety of science disciplines spanning biology, earth science, chemistry, physics, engineering, and technology. In 2018, approximately 8,000 teams of up to 15 students each participated in more than 450 competitions across all 50 states (SO, 2019). Science Olympiad competitions are like sporting events, where teams in each division (Division B is middle schools; Division C is high schools) compete against each other for medals and trophies. Events are rotated and modified yearly to address the evolving nature of science and technology while striving to appeal to a wide selection of student and teacher interests. North Dakota had 141 teams participate in the 20182019 academic year. Individual schools prepare in different ways, some through classroom activities, some through after-school training sessions, and some even set up practice competitions with neighboring schools. The North Dakota State Tournament hosts 34 different events 23 in each division with some overlap. Around 720 students compete in up to five 50-minute individual events during the tournament, and the participating students in the top three teams, in each event, receive medals. Each team’s performance on individual events is ranked on a 24-point scale and the top three teams with the highest accumulated number of points across all events are awarded trophies. The top team in each division receives an invitation to participate in the National Science Olympiad Tournament at the end of May. The Science Olympiad National Tournament is held at a different university each year, and in 2019 that tournament was held at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. The National Tournament is the culmination of nearly 300 regional tournaments from across the United States and involves 120 of the top teams from around the country. Winners at the National Tournament not only receive awards and trophies but cash scholarships, tuition awards, and prizes offered by the host universities and sponsors. For example, “In 2010, The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign reprised awards of four-year fullride scholarships for all high school gold medal winners valued at more than $100,000 each. In 2012 and 2014, the University of Central Florida offered $30,000 scholarships to all gold medal winners at the National Tournament.” (SO2, 2019). 2. 2019 North Dakota Case Study In 2019, the Science Olympiad committee decided that the Meteorology event would be conducted in division B only. Participating teams (schools) were divided into two sessions. In each session, there were 12 teams participating. Each team was represented by two students. Each team was allowed to bring two stand-alone non-programmable non-graphing calculators and four 8.5x11” sheets containing information on both sides in any form of information and from any source.",,2020.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.46275/joasc.2020.01.001?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.46275/joasc.2020.01.001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

cabbabfcf63408dc53c3d97eb8cdb9124bc547d3,Obituary: Thomas Henry Kunz (1938–2020),"Dr. Thomas Henry Kunz (Fig. 1), an internationally recognized expert on the ecology and behavior of bats and Professor at Boston University, passed away on 13 April 2020 in Dedham, Massachusetts, at the age of 81 as the result of complications from COVID-19. Tragically, Dr. Kunz’s career was cut short when he was the victim of a pedestrian–automobile accident on 26 October 2011. He was struck crossing a street in Toronto, Canada, while participating in his favorite annual meeting, that of the North American Society for Bat Research (NASBR). He never fully recovered from the head trauma suffered and was not able to live independently, but he enjoyed daily visits from his wife and frequent visits from his children and grandchildren as well as friends. His wife, Margaret, who he described in his autobiography as “a major influence on my life through her companionship, love, support, and encouragement,” also became his advocate over this extended period (197:169; numbers appearing in parentheses without an author or year refer to articles in the accompanying bibliography). “Tom,” to his many friends and colleagues, was born on 11 June 1938 in Independence, Missouri, to William H. and Edna F. (Dornfeld) Kunz. He married Margaret Louise Brown on 27 December 1962 in Faucett, Missouri, Margaret’s hometown. Two children were born to Margaret and Tom— Pamela Kunz (Jeffrey Kwan) and David Kunz (Nicole, née D’Angelo) and five grandchildren. “Dr. Kunz was an inveterate handyman who built treehouses, created jigsaw puzzles, and taught his children to use power tools and drive cars with stick shifts. He loved canoeing, bicycling, traveling with his wife, and spending time with family. ‘He was handy and he was hands-on,’ said his son David, who works in finance in New York City. ‘I might have seen him fall asleep at his computer, but he never missed a single one of my games’” (McKenna 2020). The primary influence in Tom’s early years was his father who worked for the Kansas City Power and Light Company. His father had played violin in a small local band and pitched softball for his company’s team, but his true passion was for “Chinese-style” table tennis. In his youth, Tom also developed a zeal for table tennis even winning some local competitions, but as he progressed through elementary and high school, football and track captured his interests (197). His football career at East High in Kansas City, Missouri, culminated in a 10–0 season and the city championship in his senior year as a starting defensive end. Tom’s early interest in science was sparked by a fifth-grade teacher who had her students undertake a project raising silkworms. Tom commented in his autobiography that, “This experience left an indelible impression on me, and highlights the power of observational learning” (197:150). Tom also had an early experience with a bat colony inside a stove in a fishing cabin. After chasing and removing the bats from the cabin, Tom recalled, “being fascinated by these little winged ‘critters’” (197:150). Tom became an Eagle Scout and remembered taking great pride in earning his nature merit badge, which required learning the names of local plants and animals. When Tom graduated from high school, he was planning to attend college and play football; however, offers to play did not come so he changed his plans and joined the U.S. Army in summer applyparastyle ""fig//caption/p[1]"" parastyle ""FigCapt"" applyparastyle ""fig"" parastyle ""Figure""",Journal of Mammalogy,2020.0,1,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article-pdf/101/6/1752/35926811/gyaa100.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/jmammal/gyaa100?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyaa100, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a48ea3d487a63c2553248e88bf532030dfef1e99,CS4All: An Early Look at Teacher Implementation in NYC,"CS for All initiatives have emerged around the country in the last decade with the hopes of addressing the growing call for all students to have opportunities to be proficient computational thinkers and to be exposed to computer science (CS) curriculum throughout their educational careers. As districts and states grapple with the realities of implementing such initiatives, they must address a key barrier: a lack of teacher capacity to teach CS. NYC's Computer Science for All (CS4All) is a 10-year, districtwide initiative aimed at providing high-quality computer science (CS) education to all public-school students. To address teacher capacity issues, the district has designed and implemented professional development (PD) with the goal of providing high-quality training to nearly 5,000 teachers by 2025. We conducted online surveys with about 1,500 teachers who participated in the multi-day professional development to assess the early outcomes of this effort. Results from two years of surveys offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, ability of teachers to implement CS in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering CS (even in a district where CS is a priority). They also provide insight into how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs compared to schools serving students with lower economic needs. The successes and challenges highlighted by these data inform the work of other districts and states around the country engaged in similar efforts.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2020.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3328778.3372627?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3372627, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

445a79b6010b2a4402134937fc9d41e26973264c,Analysis of the Results of Using the Means of Organisation of Distance Learning when Training the Future Primary School Teachers under the Conditions of Quarantine,"The study analyses the results of using software and hardware during distance learning. The basis for the study was the Khmelnytskyi Humanitarian-Pedagogical Academy and the Municipal Institution of Higher Education “Mykhailo Hrushevskyi Barskyi HumanitarianPedagogical College”. A survey of students who studied computer science in the 1st and 2nd year of the specialty “Primary Education” was conducted. This allowed studying the attitude of the future primary school teachers towards different means of distance learning, determining the conditions for organising distance learning for students of both institutions, comparing the results of teaching computer science for the future primary school teachers by distance and conventional forms. It was found that most students are positive about the use of the platforms offered by the institution and consider their opportunities sufficient for their learning. Adaptation to the new platforms and tools took several weeks. The most popular among the tools were Google Classroom, blog, cloud documents, video tutorials on YouTube, online tests, and more. Quite a large number of students underestimate the effectiveness of video conferencing and prefer other types of electronic materials. However, when explaining new material, sounding presentations increases the level of knowledge acquisition. The main problems that students face during distance learning are the lack of access to computer devices and the Internet, as well as a considerable number of tasks in various disciplines, which causes overload and deterioration of both students’ well-being and the quality of their education. The study of students’ grades in the discipline “Computer Science” in 2019 and 2020 made it possible to compare the results at the beginning of quarantine and at the end of the semester. This approach allows determining the effectiveness of the use of distance learning. The results indicate that during the quarantine there was no considerable deterioration in student grades. Statistical analysis confirmed the identity of the results of semester control in groups that studied in the conventional and distance form",,2020.0,3,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.52534/msu-pp.6(2).2020.30-40', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.52534/MSU-PP.6(2).2020.30-40?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.52534/MSU-PP.6(2).2020.30-40, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1a7c3b32d0bb3714a5c3a77fe49555a986581109,A Study on Customer Satisfaction in E-retailing With Special Reference to Consumer Electronics and Appliances: An Analytical Research on Indian Perspective,"The e-retailing is accelerating towards excellence with ever-evolving trends and an escalating number of e- shoppers every year. About 67% of the people with utmost buying power in our society prefer e- shopping. India has been going through a digital revolution during the last five years, which is transforming the consumer shopping experience, at a different level. The evolving consumer preferences, rising disposable income, increasing usage of smart phones, and extensive exposure to digital media are significantly impacting the Indian retail market dynamics. It is expected that, E-Commerce in India will surpass INR 2,000 billion by 2025, with consumer electronics being one of its key drivers. India’s demographic profile has undergone a characteristic evolution. GenY, the working-age population, working women, and the Indian middle-class, have evolved to be the most influential segments of the population triggering new social, technological, and economic trends. Urbanization will also affect the market, such that 64% of the total Indian population will be urbanized by 2025, and cities will account for 70% of India’s GDP by 2030. Urban planning initiatives, such as development of mega cities and mega regions, and the more recent smart cities initiatives are considered as enablers for a higher rate of urbanization. Consumer electronics and appliances market in India is expected to reach approximately $30 billion by 2020. The penetration of online retail in electronics and appliances sales was around 3-5% in 2016, and it is expected to reach around 20-25% by 2020. This translates to the online retailing in electronics increasing at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 75%, during 2016 to 2020. 
 
With the ever expanding internet access and greater preference to shop online, it is expected that, the landscape of Indian consumer electronics will transform in the next five years. It is extremely important that, the consumer electronics and appliances companies acknowledge this change, and start redefining their retail strategies, in order to benefit in the long run. Consumer electronics and appliances companies have been pushing products in the market, through several initiatives, such as bundled offers, discounts and aggressive pricing. However, it is the time to reinvent the wheel, as the consumers are more inclined towards buying high involvement consumer electronics products online. This transition has happened over the last 2-3 years, as there are multiple e-commerce platforms, combined with the growing preference for convenience offered by online shopping over traditional retail stores. 
 
Consumers are also becoming extremely intelligent these days, where they survey models in a brick-and-mortar retail outlet, and compare the prices with the online portals. In our country, price is still the top-most factor driving purchase, and the consumers would buy it from the medium that offers it at the lowest price. In case of consumer electronics companies, who plan and run promotional campaigns around the festive seasons, online e-commerce players run these on a monthly basis, as they can easily play with the extra margins that they have, due to elimination of stakeholders in the value chain. In addition to factors such as comparison of multiple products, online market places have a lot of schemes using multiple payment channels, that provide additional cashbacks and discounts. Growth of mobile internet users will be one of the key reasons for driving growth in this channel, covering more than 300 million users in India, in the next few years. With increasing network infrastructure development and usage of wireless technologies such as 3G and 4G, overall internet user base in India is expected to be 600 million in 2020, which accounts for 27% penetration. 
 
Consumer electronics and appliances companies have been strategizing for the last three years to reap the benefits of the online retailing channel. Dedicated digital sales and marketing teams have been set up by certain leading consumer appliance players, while some others are tieing up with ecommerce players to push their products. Companies also focus on hyperlocal strategies of partnership with the leading e-commerce market places such as Flipkart and Amazon, where they are able to directly provide the product to the customer through the nearest or branded stores in the vicinity. This helps them in ensuring that the competitive pricing is maintained, while the dealers are also able to push their products through alternate channels. Online marketplaces provide additional services to their partners to track and push products online. They provide solutions, that help sellers in case of inventory and order management, as well as conduct in-depth analysis of sales trends. This enables sellers to strategize on how to improve their product line, as well as their marketing strategy. 
 
During the festive season in 2016, it was observed that approximately 25% of LED television sales, 8-10% of washing machines, refrigerators and air-conditioners, and 30% of microwaves sales were contributed through the online channel. The e-commerce retailers offer most products at discounted rates, which none of the physical stores can match. There is also the additional benefit of the retailers providing services in more than 100 cities in India, which helps customers to access their preferred brands. 
 
Number of previous researches in this area has been reviewed to identify whether there is any research gap or scope for further research: 
Elliot and Fowell (2000) stated that, the different levels of online buying intensity are not significantly related to the intensity of internet usage among the customers. The finding reveals, high intensity internet usage does not associate with high intensity online buying which confirms the fact that, the customers use internet for other purposes predominantly, and online buying activity is a supplementary utility exploited through the internet. Park and Kim (2003) asserted that, the e-retailing enterprises should identify the means to convert low and medium intensity online buyers into high intensity online buyers. Such enterprise can incorporate real-time online support in the form of live chat systems to the customers through their e-commerce portals as suggested by the authors, and enhanced service quality would be the differentiating factor among the competitors in future e-markets. Korgaonkar et al. (2006) opined that, the online retailers need to either establish a strong presence, or perish by the popularity of competitors in the long run. The authors also stated that, all the products and services are not equally popular among the customers. The findings of the study revealed that, the customers prefer the online mode of purchase, only for few product categories. For rest of the products, the customers‟ preferences are inclined more towards the physical mode of purchase. Hernandez et al. (2011) found that, the income levels of the customers are significantly associated with their intensity of online purchase. The authors indicated that, the medium income group customers are more active in exploiting the price advantages for the products offered through online retailer. Bhowmik (2012) opined that, internet has opened up a new possibility for trade and commerce with an increased ability of the sellers to push product beyond the boundary of specific market. While explaining the nature of e-commerce adoption in small and medium enterprises in Bangladesh, the details of the various government level supports towards e-commerce growth and development is well explained in this study. Niranjanamurthy et al. (2013) subdivided e-commerce into three categories such as, business-to-business or B2B (Cisco), business-to-consumer or B2C (Amazon), and consumer-to-consumer or C2C (eBay). Further, the above study listed the advantages of mobile commerce systems in line with each category of e-commerce systems, where it is reported that the security issues like computer security, data security and other wider realms of the information security framework affects the confidence levels of the end users, while reaping the benefits of these systems. The authors also raised concerns over the limitations and security issues of e-commerce. 
 
These aforesaid studies stimulate the researchers to proceed further in this area. So a comprehensive research is executed on two e-commerce giants operating in India. Starting with their sales-assets and income trends, a time series forecasting has been incorporated. Further, a primary research is performed to identify the most significant factor in online retailing of electronics appliances with respect to their Customer Satisfaction in E-Retailing and to check whether there is any association between these independent variable with the dependent variable. Then, those two companies are compared on the basis of those important factors; and lastly with respect to the impact of the independent variables on the customer satisfaction. For this purpose, secondary data are collected from CMIE Prowess. On the other hand, 200 respondents are surveyed with the help of a questionnaire containing 15 parameters.

6992af30d7b4c139611a1d3b05685183fcf4dafe,Generating 2.5D Motion Graphics from 2D Designs,"As of the year 2020, the video production industry is worth 31 billion dollars in the United States alone, with more than 6000 businesses and 57000 employees, and keeps growing. The global computer animation market size is anticipated to reach USD 28.30 billion by 2025, according to Grand View Research, Inc. Such significant growth demands the tech industry to introduce better tools for making animations. In this paper, we propose our contribution, specifically for User Interface designers in the field of motion graphics. Ul/UX design is found to be one of the top 5 most trending opportunities for motion designers, and our proposed system allows them to generate a 2.5D animation based on a 2D Futuristic User Interface (FUI) design. The ultimate goal is to reduce the production time of FUI animations and minimize the cost of responding to the client's changes. Obtaining clients' feedback directly on animations rather than still images would improve the client's involvement in production, resulting in greater confidence and loyalty. We implement several image processing techniques such as thinning and pixel clustering for pre-processing the 2D designs to segment the given design into an array of atomic shapes. Since the thinned shapes ensure that any pixel in the design does not have adjacent pixels which are also adjacent to each other, it is possible to utilize mathematical means to approximate the shapes. Our system converts a given 2D design to a collection of animated lines and arcs distributed in 3D space that eventually can be exported to the industry-standard tool, Adobe After Effects.",International Conference on Automation and Computing,2020.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357147?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357147, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In July 2020, the Ghana Communication Technology University (GCTU) bill was passed by Parliament of Ghana which changed the status of the university from private to public institution. Nearly eight thousand (8000) students are pursuing various programmes at this university including engineering, computer science, business administration and management. The University also runs a Graduate school which delivers post graduate programmes. At the Ghana Communication Technology University (GCTU), students enroll to pursue Diploma, Bachelors’ Degrees, Masters’ Degrees and Doctoral programmes every year.

The study was made to give better understanding to this FM definition and to assist facility managers to execute their work successfully. One (1) research question was formulated for the study and the intuition of the author was used in selecting three (3) words, which are integration, improvement/change and productivity to be examined to generate understanding for the researcher and add to knowledge. A literature review on these key words was conducted to ascertain views of earlier researchers on integration in FM, change in FM and productivity in FM. This study revealed that facility management integrates people, place and processes in the built environment in order to save time, reduces cost, hasten implementation and bring competition into business services. The study also revealed that educational facilities like furniture and equipment get used up over time and require replacement intermittently to meet growing need and demand. Existing buildings with their fixtures and fittings also age over time and require periodic refurbishment to be put to efficient use. Another finding of this study was that key performance indicators (KPI) like “cost-effectiveness” and “client satisfaction are worldwide accepted measures for productivity in facility management because it is a “value added” service which cannot be stated directly like market goods.",International journal of business management,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'http://www.internationaljournalcorner.com/index.php/theijbm/article/download/155910/107773', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.24940/THEIJBM/2020/V8/I10/BM2010-014?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.24940/THEIJBM/2020/V8/I10/BM2010-014, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2bb64c4ff567e71e761c697b1df10b9e0c557d26,THE GUIDE TO NP-COMPLETENESS IS 40 YEARS OLD: AN HOMAGE TO DAVID S. JOHNSON,"Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NPCompleteness, by Michael R. Garey and David S. Johnson, was published 40 years ago (1979). Despite its age, it is unanimously considered by many in the computational complexity community as its most important book. NPcompleteness is perhaps the single most important concept to come out of theoretical computer science. The book was written in the late 1970s, when problems solvable in polynomial time were linked to the concepts of efficiently solvable and tractability, and the complexity class NP was defined to capture the concept of good characterization. Besides his contributions to the theory of NP-completeness, David S. Johnson also made important contributions to approximation algorithms and the experimental analysis of algorithms. This paper summarizes many of Johnson’s contributions to these areas and is a homage to his memory. 1. Johnson’s contributions to NP-completeness Cook (1971) and Levin (1973) in the early 1970s proved the seminal theorem for the theory of NP-completeness establishing that Satisfiability is NP-complete. The subsequent seminal paper by Karp (1972) establishing 21 NP-complete problems was the first to use the terms P and NP, although polynomial complete was the name used at the time for the hard problems. To mark the 40th anniversary in 2012 of the publication of the Karp’s paper, where the wide applicability of the NP-completeness concept was established, David S. Johnson wrote the paper A Brief History of NP-Completeness (Johnson, 2012). The year 2012 also marked the 100th birthday of Alan Turing, whose Turing machine is the basic model for computation used to define the classes P and NP (Haeusler, 2012). The early involvement of David S. Johnson with NP-completeness mainly concerned the methods for coping with hard problems, by designing and analyzing approximation algorithms. David S. Johnson met Michael R. Garey at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, and one of their first collaborations was to answer a letter by Donald Knuth seeking a better name for polynomial complete. Garey and Johnson proposed the term NP-complete. For a detailed account by Knuth about the choice of the name NP-complete, we refer to Knuth (1974). The popularity of the NP-completeness concept and of its guidebook increased when the P versus NP problem was selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute as one of the seven Millennium Problems to motivate research on important classic Date: September 7, 2020.",,2020.0,2,"{'url': 'http://www.scielo.br/pdf/pope/v40/1678-5142-pope-40-e236329.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1590/0101-7438.2020.040.00236329?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1590/0101-7438.2020.040.00236329, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

deb8b6f6fd4c6ef57a02cd9c3ec9bc0ab31c5a1d,First Bytes: Preparing K-12 Educators for CS Inclusion,"In 2016, Former U.S. President Obama started a Computer Science For All initiative [1] and in Europe it is the Informatics For All initiative [2]. In 2020, many school systems are still trying to figure out how to meet the learning requirements of bringing Computer Science (CS) into every primary and secondary classroom. As state department of education offices throughout the United States are trying to support the initiative and have started adding CS requirements to standardized testing, the lack of professional development (PD) for educators has been forgotten. How does a physical education teacher, a special education teacher, a foreign language teacher, and a history teacher bring CS concepts into their classrooms? This immediately caused a high demand for Computer Science (CS) professional development for primary and secondary teachers. Some school systems did not even fully understand what CS was, so they were unable to identify PD needs, evaluate PD options, or track their educator's inclusion of it. Over the past two years, I have conducted Computer Science PD sessions for educators in three formats (one year of weekend sessions, one year mentoring through computer clubs, and one year undergraduate CS courses) of with varying lengths of commitment by the participants, who came from different backgrounds. Participants were from the K-12 areas of Math, Technology Education, English, Special education, and English Language Learners. A side-by-side comparison of these sessions based on different categories such as targeted grade level, workshop durations, prior educator knowledge area, curriculum development information, training tools, and lessons learned will be provided in this poster. The sessions were structured using participatory design [3] and traditional college undergraduate online course work. Initial pilot results were collected through a survey prior to receiving the PD. These early results show that K-12 teachers in non-career and technical classrooms believe that CS is just programming or do not know how to apply CS concepts to their subject matter. The results further show that many of the K-12 teachers felt that the majority of existing PD simply provided lesson plans [4] versus teaching them CS competencies to allow them the creativity to develop their own lesson plans and to support their students CS questions. In a few cases, for example pilot participants were surprised to learn that CS does not always include programming. We are currently using conjecture maps [5] and data sorting to process and analyze the data from our three formats. The conjecture mapping will aid in seeing where we can improve to ensure that K-12 teachers in our service area are comfortable with CS topic inclusion. We will also be able to duplicate a successful approach for cybersecurity topics in the future, as that is now also being added by stated department of education boards within the United States.",International Computing Education Research Workshop,2020.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3372782.3408110?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3372782.3408110, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6c1d9f8a8d02aaaa0cfdd1829adf8f0e0d801d4b,Development and Characterization of Blast Resistant Genetic Stocks in Rice for Pi 9 Gene through Backcross Breeding,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a self-pollinated diploid plant (2n=24) with a genome size of 430 Mb and is the most important staple cereal food crop in world. Asia accounts for 90 percent of global rice consumption, and total rice demand continues to rise. To ensure food security, the efficient way is the continuous improvement of rice yield (Liang et al., 2014) and the current level of production needs to be increased to 130 million tonnes by the year 2025. Inspite of being an important staple crop, rice is affected by many biotic and abiotic stresses. Of all the biotic stresses, blast caused by the heterothallic ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (Hebert), is a major restriction on rice production in both tropical and temperate rice growing regions of the world (Raghu et al., 2018). This is a polycystic disease spread by asexual spores (conidia) that infect above ground tissues of rice plants (Ou et al., 1985; Talbot and Wilson, 2009; Pennisi, 2010).

Hybrids under Different Nitrogen Levels during Wet Season in New Alluvial Zone of West Bengal,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important cereal crop and grown across the world. It is an important cereal crop next to wheat which accounts for the major dietary energy requirement of Asian rural people as more than 90% of rice is grown and consumed in Asia. It is a principal source of food for more than half of the world’s population and also predicted that a 50 60 % increase in rice production will be required to meet demand from population growth by 2025. To sustain the self sufficiency in coming decades, the production of rice needs to be increased every year by almost 2 million tonnes. The challenging task of plateauing trend observed in yield potential of high yielding rice varieties and decreasing natural resource base can be done by hybrid rice technology.

e7828f59efb811dd0284ace800d45a6dee7850c7,CiSE Guest Editors’ Guide,"Approved by CiSE AEiCs on 3 March 2020. Computing in Science and Engineering (CiSE) is a technical magazine of the IEEE Computer Society, in publication since 1999. CiSE publishes peer-reviewed research articles, and also runs departments spanning news and analyses, topical reviews, tutorials, case studies, and more. CiSE runs special issues on themes chosen by the editorial board, which are handled by Guest Editors. This document explains the editorial workflow of special issues, and the role and responsibilities of Guest Editors.Selection of Special Issue ThemesSpecial Issues are proposed by members of the editorial board, or other community members, for the consideration of the Editor-in-Chief (EiC), and Associate Editors-in-Chief (AEiCs). They are approved by the EiC, with concurrence of a majority of the AEICs. (CiSE currently has 5 AEiCs, so three of them should be supportive of the theme). A special issue needs to have at least two Guest Editors, and should be approved at least one year prior to the expected publication.Invited or Open SubmissionsMost special issues make an open call for submissions of papers relevant to the issue theme. Guest editors may propose an invited special issue, for which articles will be submitted via a closed CFP, and this may be approved by the EiC with support from AEiCs.  To avoid perceived conflict of interest, guest editors should refrain from inviting authors from their own institutions, or authors who were their graduate students or postdoctoral trainees. All invited articles undergo the same peer-review process as unsolicited ones.Invited Special Issues are generally limited to one per year.Special Issue ProposalsProposals for future CiSE special issues should be sent to the EiC directly, and should include the following materials:Description—An overview of topic and scope, and reasons why it is timely to dedicate a magazine issue to this theme.Guest editors—A short bio for each guest editor, addressing how they are well positioned to lead the community to submit and review manuscripts.Draft CFP—A preliminary drafting of the call for papers, subject to improvements after approval.Dissemination plans—How the guest editors plan to reach authors and ensure success of the special issue.Proposed issue date—Considering any related timelines (e.g., when articles stem from workshops, conferences, or world events), anticipated date of CFP and publication. Role and Responsibilities of Guest EditorsGuest editors assume the responsibility of an Associate Editor in charge of the manuscripts submitted to the special issue. They manage the peer review of submitted manuscripts, ensure publication quality, and adhere to the IEEE and Computer Society’s policies. \cite{manual2020}The IEEE Computer Society has published a Guest Editor Information webpage. CiSE complies with these guidelines, but is sometimes stricter.Follow these guidelines for CiSE Special Issues:Guest editors write a special-issue introduction, which should be 1000 to 2200 words in length (5 pages or less), discussing the state of the art and future directions in the theme topic. It should highlight how each article in the special issue contributes to the field, and it may introduce key concepts and terminology, to facilitate a smooth reading of the articles. The guest editors’ introduction should state whether the issue had an invited or open CFP. It should be sent directly to the EiC.Other than the introduction to the special issue, a guest editor may not be an author or co-author of another article in the special issue they are editing. If some special circumstances warrant it (e.g., a needed survey of the field), they should request special dispensation from the EiC, who will seek concurrence from two AEiCs. Guest editors should actively solicit submissions via outreach through their networks, and make every effort to ensure a healthy number of manuscripts are assessed via peer review to be part of the special issue. Guest editors invite reviewers who are experts in the topic of the special issue ahead of the submission deadline. The reviewers should confirm their willingness to serve, and be ready to review their assigned articles within three weeks. Computer Society policies require each manuscript to receive three independent reviews. Guest editors oversee the timeliness and quality of peer-review reports. They should not take the role of reviewers, themselves.Guest editors should not handle the peer review of manuscripts where a real or apparent conflict of interest (COI, see below) is present with any authors. These include: affiliation, previous co-authorship, having formally mentored the author (as PhD or postdoctoral supervisor), or having collaborated in a funded grant. In the case of a submission by an author where a potential COI may exist (real or apparent) with one or more of the guest editors, the guest editors should seek guidance from the EiC on how the COI might be mitigated. The submission may be allowed to go forward, in which case the guest editor will delegate the handling of peer review of this submission to another member of the editorial board, with guidance from the EiC. Guest Editors are also responsible for ensuring that articles conform to Computer Society policies, and the magazine style. Common issues that arise in this regard are the word limits, and limits on the number of references. According to CiSE guidelines for authors: Articles should be between 2,400 and 6,250 words, including all main body, abstract, keyword, bibliography, and biography text. Each table and figure counts for 250 words. They  should have no more than 12 references. Articles should be written for an interdisciplinary audience, be concise, and tend to be more readable than scholarly in style. Special issues typically consist of about 6 articles. Informed by the peer reviews, guest editors select the articles to appear in the issue, which may result in good-quality articles having to be rejected. In exceptional situations of a theme being very popular, guest editors may request approval from the EiC to run a Part 2 of the theme in a later issue. Transfer of special-issue submissions to the regular article queue is discouraged.Definition of Conflict of Interest“A conflict of interest is defined as any situation, transaction, or relationship in which a member’s, volunteer’s, or staff person’s decisions, actions, or votes could materially affect that individual’s professional, personal, financial, or business concerns.” [p.22 IEEE PSPB Operations Manual] An Associate Editor is regarded as having a COI with a manuscript if any author is employed at the same institution as the editor. It is also a COI if the editor has co-authored a paper or has closely collaborated in a research project with any of the manuscript's authors  in the previous five years.Editorial WorkflowWhen a special issue is approved, the editorial workflow is as follows:",,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.22541/au.158359748.81106455', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22541/au.158359748.81106455?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22541/au.158359748.81106455, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The study used the phenomenological design, which is among qualitative research designs. The study group comprised 63 academicians carrying out duty in 21 different universities in Turkey during the 2019−2020 academic year. In line with the goal, the study was carried out with academicians who could contribute on voluntary basis. In order to determine the views of the academicians, a structured interview form was used. The interview form comprises four questions aiming to determine the necessity of distance education in the physical education area, which courses in the area can be given within the scope of distance education, possibility of teaching applied courses via distance education and problems they face in courses in the distance education process which has been put into effect compulsorily due to pandemic. The interview form was presented to the opinion of two instructors in the educational sciences area who have carried out qualitative research and then expert opinion was received. The application was conducted by primarily reaching the aforementioned academicians via telephone interview between 1 June−27 July 2020 and conveying the questions via e-mail. The descriptive analysis technique was used in analysis of the data. In the study 79% of the academicians stressed that applied courses should not be taught via distance education, while 52% stated that all theoretical courses could be taught via distance education. Examining the views of the academicians on the problems they faced in courses in the distance education process; 55% stated that the problems were associated with the system, 36% efficiency of the course, 30% inadequate student participation in the course, 21% inadequate student feedback, 21% evaluation, 19% inexperience about distance education and 17% lack of internet and computer opportunities in hometowns of students.

6dd70b8a661cdad8ab9ef00b4ae3d07e70674c0c,Exploration on the Construction of Fundamentals of Robotics Innovative Course under the Background of New Engineering,"With the rapid development of robotics, the significance of the course construction of robotics in the construction of new engineering courses in colleges and universities in China has become increasingly prominent. Fundamentals of Robotics is an interdisciplinary course, through which students' cognitive level and innovative practical ability of robotics can be cultivated. According to the characteristics of the robotics course, it studies and explores the teaching orientation, course content, implementation method, evaluation system and construction conditions and guarantee of robotics course in this paper, and puts forward the course construction plan from the perspective of improving the innovation ability, which provides some ideas for the robot course construction. Introduction In recent years, China has become one of the fastest growing countries in the robot industry. In May 2015, the State Council officially issued Made in China 2025. In the ten strategic areas, robot is the second strategic area, its importance is self-evident. In February 2017, the Ministry of Education issued the Notice of the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education on Research and Practice of New Projects. Its main purpose is to carry out teaching methods and curriculum reform, and cultivate high-end application-oriented talents in a more effective way[1-3]. Robot has the natural attribute of high-tech content and multi-disciplinary integration. It is a good carrier to carry out a new round of engineering reform and improve the quality of teaching. Therefore, it is of great value and significance to carry out robot course construction and robot teaching task design in applied undergraduate colleges. Current Situation and Development Trend of Robot Education In May 2016, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance jointly issued the Development Plan of Robot Industry (2016-2020), which proposed the overall development goal of China's robot industry during the 13th Five Year Plan period, that is, ""To form a relatively complete robot industry system, significantly improve the technological innovation ability and international competitiveness, achieve the performance level of similar products in the world, make major breakthroughs in the quality level of key parts, and basically meet the market demand."" Since then, the application and demand of robots in various industries have been expanding. At the same time, there are not enough high-level professionals engaged in robot system design and development, robot technology integration and robot system installation. In the National Vocational College Skills Competition Implementation Plan (2017-2020) released in September 2016, it was clearly proposed that the skills competition in the next 10 years should focus on the Made in China 2025 strategy. Therefore, as a key development field of Made in China 2025, robot will become an increasingly important direction of applied undergraduate and vocational college curriculum education and personnel training. 2020 Conference on Educational Science and Educational Skills (ESES2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000606 ISBN: 978-1-80052-003-5 -309At present, more and more science and engineering subjects in colleges and universities begin to offer robotics, robot control and other related courses for undergraduate and junior graduate students. As a science and engineering discipline of application-oriented universities, strengthening the teaching construction and reform of robotics foundation and other related courses is one of the most forward-looking and innovative development directions. Developing robot education and building related knowledge system has become the key to the development of application-oriented universities[4-5]. Analysis of Characteristics of Robotics Course Teaching Robot technology integrates many advanced technologies such as mechanics, sensing, driving, control, computer software and hardware, and artificial intelligence. The course construction of robotics is naturally complex and comprehensive. The coupling of robot technology with other disciplines should be considered. At the same time, the practicality, innovation and relevance with robot related industries should be emphasized to ensure the role and significance of robot course construction. Comprehensive and Interactive Robot research is an interdisciplinary field. It is difficult for students to fully understand the robot's mechanical structure, motion control system, sensor system and the practice of practical engineering projects only through a single course. Facing to such a multi-disciplinary course, the traditional teaching mode can not be used to design and arrange teaching tasks. It is necessary to lay out the overall goal of talent training, consider the relevance between the front and back of the curriculum, and effectively set up an all-around discipline talent training system, so as not to become a ""lonely island"" of the curriculum. Experimental and Practical Robot course has a strong demand of experiment and practice. Only through the explanation of theoretical knowledge or the simulation of virtual technology, it is difficult for students to have an intuitive and comprehensive understanding of the robot system. In general, the investment of robot experimental equipment is relatively expensive. In order to ensure that students complete the necessary hands-on operation and debugging in the process of experiment and practice, it is necessary to coordinate the overall guarantee of the course equipment and teaching environment, so as to avoid the course ""emphasizing theory and ignoring practice"". Industry and Innovation At present, the robotics course and robotics discipline in China are just starting, and the staff engaged in the robotics industry are difficult to meet the post requirements in a short period of time, so the phenomenon of application-oriented talents vacancy has formed. Based on these, on the one hand, it is necessary to evaluate the promotion and supply function of the course construction to the current robot industry environment, on the other hand, it is also necessary to consider the medium and long-term construction and innovation development of the course, so as to form a solid and powerful course construction scheme and robot innovation talent reserve. The Construction of Fundamentals of Robotics Innovative Course based on Innovative Thinking Teaching Orientation of the Course The course Fundamentals of Robotics (referred to as the course ) is a task-driven professional course that integrates theory and practice. Through good connection with the pre and follow-up courses, with the method of ""integration of theory and practice, learning and doing"", and with the goal of ""flexible learning and application of learning"", students can start from the robot body and practical",2020 Conference on Educational Science and Educational Skills (ESES2020),2020.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38007/proceedings.0000606?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38007/proceedings.0000606, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The conference will be organized partially by personal attendance of participants as well as virtually using Internet communication technologies (Zoom, Skype). The conference attendance will be organized in compliance with all sanitary standards and safety requirements. The majority of participants will take part in the Conference virtually. It is worth noting that the option of virtual participation allows expanding significantly the geography and increasing the number of participants. More than 320 participants from different regions of Russian Federation as well as from Asia and Europe will present their reports during the Conference sessions. The conference has already received 194 submissions that were reviewed. Finally, 85 papers were accepted for publication in IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering. The papers cover the conference topics; they present results of theoretical and experimental studies in such areas as hypersonic aerothermodynamics, combustion, detonation, multiphase flows and heat and mass transfer processes, nonequilibrium processes in nozzles and jets, plasma aerodynamics, rarefied gas flows, interaction of flows with the surface, solid mechanics, tribology. Among the accepted papers, there are some devoted to modern methods of numerical modeling, high performance computing, artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning and big data processing.

0c72dab895afdeb59b433dd26d209548ece8bb25,The Implementation of Online Learning in Early Childhood Education During the Covid-19 Pandemic,"Covid-19 has changed the learning process from class attendance to distance learning using the Internet. Early childhood education is threatened to enter into the lost generation, due to distance learning, which causes confusion for teachers and parents to be able to provide the best stimulation for them. Therefore, the Indonesian government made a new policy on online learning. The objectives of this research are to find how effective at online learning policy formulation, how productive it is in policy implementation, and what are the obstacles of the implementation at Early-Childhood Education (ECE). This qualitative research uses a mixed method approach with an iterative analysis design, conducted in Central Java Province in 35 districts / cities with 1,899 respondents. Data collection techniques with open-closed questionnaires, study from 15 documentation, and in-depth interviews. Data analysis uses quantitative-qualitative software Nvivo12+, with Miles and Huberman models. The results showed the policy formulation of online learning at ECE has been effective. However, the implementation of online learning policy at ECE still takes a lot of effort to become more powerful in preventing a decline in learning. There are five obstacles in in applying this in the field, namely the ability of teachers, the ability of parents, economic capability, facility constraints, and pedagogical constraints.

This study sought to investigate the effect of femoral and tibial coronal rotation and femoral axial rotation on midflexion coronal joint balance and patient outcomes. A prospective multi-center study was performed with a mixture of tibia-first gapbalancing and femur-first approaches were performed using the Corin OMNIBotics robot-assisted TKA platform with APEX implant components. Coronal and axial femoral and tibial resections were recorded by the platform. Medial and lateral joint gaps were recorded while applying a computer-controlled load to the joint throughout flexion during trialing using the Corin BalanceBot device. In addition, 1-year Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and PROMIS-10 global health scores were collected. 231 surgeries were identified: 66.9±8.1 years, 31.4±4.8 kg/m2 and 57% female (121) with a mean pre-operative HKA angle of 4.5±5.2° varus. A significant correlation was found between the medio-lateral (ML) joint gap difference in midflexion and both extension and flexion joint line (p=0.003, r2=-0.20, p=0.001, r2=-0.22, respectively). A significant correlation was found between midflexion ML imbalance and KOOS stiffness Health Sciences EPiC Series in Health Sciences Volume 4, 2020, Pages 293–296 CAOS 2020.

22c26e6044d0bcd21a2331cf05f473eedbd93d79,"The Influence of Virtual Physics Laboratory on Senior High School Form one Physics Students Performance and Cognitive Achievement at Bishop Herman College, Kpando, Volta Region- Ghana","The main objective of this study was to find out the influence of virtual physics laboratory on students’ performance and cognitive achievements in motion. The total population for the study was 63 second year science students; 42 in the control group and 21 in the experimental group at Bishop Herman College, Kpando. Quasiexperimental design was adopted in this study. Questionnaire, test and were the research instruments used. The data were analyzed by using SPSS 16.0 statistical analysis program and statistics such as mean, Standard Deviation were calculated and a paired sample t-test technique was used. The mean test score of the experimental group (22.2) was higher than their control group (13.6) counterparts in the post-test. The ttest analysis of the mean score on the post-test shows a significant difference between the 2 groups (t = 5.465; p < 0.05). There is a significant difference between the participation of the students who were exposed to the VPLAB approach and their counterparts who were exposed to the traditional approach. The finding of the present study clearly revealed that students learned concept of motion effect through virtual physics lab in a better way as compared to teaching in abstract. BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY Students perceive information in different ways. That is why teachers use variety of teaching strategies to improve students’ learning. Educational systems around the world are under pressure to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) to enhance teaching and learning. There are many ways to present new and challenging information in teaching and learning. Computer programmes allow the incorporation of pictures, sounds and animation into teaching and learning which extends the teachers capacity to present lessons that encourage students’ interaction with the subject matter. It is evident that the students at the second cycle schools are becoming more advanced in the use of technology. Physics is one of the major aspects of science which students in Ghana dislike. Research conducted by Wanbugu and Changeiywo (2008) classified physics as difficult subject, not popular, avoided by students and with poor performance in schools. This researcher observed that this assertion also pertains to the science students of Bishop Herman College, Kpando where this study was done. The researcher, observed that most science students at Bishop Herman College passed very well in other science subjects after carefully going through their exercise books and also their performance in their final examination but perform poorly in Physics. It was in this regard that this study examined the option of using virtual physics laboratory to enhance teaching and learning of physic in Bishop Herman College, Kpando. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM The use of multimedia in teaching in the second cycle is not encouraging. As a result, physics students’ participation and cognitive achievement in physics was very low. The researcher realized that, the students’ interest in motion was very low. He found out that, most students could not solve simple problem under the topic correctly. Motion has always been a problem to Senior High School students offering physics. For this reason, the researcher used Computer program (VPLAB) to teach in order to determine the effect of the program on the students’ performance with respect to motion. The use of the program was supplemented with the use of pedagogical strategies such as group work; hands-on learning and technology enhanced learning techniques to achieve the needed results. Objectives The objectives of the study were as follows: 1. To identify factors that affected the students’ participation and performance in motion. 2. To determine the outcome of the use of VPLAB on students’ cognitive achievement. Research Questions The research questions below serve as a guide in the investigations: 1. What factors influence students’ participation and performance in motion? 2. What are students’ cognitive achievement in motion when they are taught using the VPLAB Null hypothesis The following null hypotheses were formulated for the study: 1. HO: There is no significant difference between the cognitive achievements of students and the use of VPLAB in lessons on motion. Educational Significance of the Study International Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences (IJEAS) ISSN: 2394-3661, Volume-7, Issue-9, September 2020 The outcome of this study will go a long way to enhance the teaching and learning of motion at Senior High Schools in Ghana. The use of VPLAB in teaching mechanics enable students to visualize scientific concept “dynamically and authentically” (Jackson, Krajcik & Soloway, 2000) and stir up their interest. The use of VPLAB would also bring to light possible misconception which when addressed would enhance students’ understanding. To curriculum developers and designers, the success in the use of VPLAB in the teaching and learning of motion would give them a new perspective in recommending its use across the educational system. REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE ICT integration in teaching and learning of physics Technology has been a party of schooling for many decades but until recently the technologies being used were rather simple and changed slowly. When the field of physics developed the area of electronics, cheaper gadgets have been manufactured and their production, demand and uses have dramatically increased. To underscore this, in 1983 there were just about 50,000 computers in American schools (Stantrock,2004). With the introduction of cheap modems and competing internet service providers a teacher in the rural areas can easily access the internet and specifically for this study there are various websites that have physics videos and physics animations that can be downloaded to suit any topic within the Ghanaian curriculum. Besides, video cameras and DVD players were previously having a prohibitive price but now, any school that wishes to invest in this hardware can do so as their prices has really gone down. Unlike other science subject’s physics has many demonstrations that can be recorded and considering that the basic scientific principles do not change any recorded videos can be used without getting outdated. The internet is the core of computer mediated communication. In many cases it has more current up-to-date information than the physics text books. This would therefore be of great use to the teachers in keeping abreast with immerging issues in the subject so as to be at par with the rest of the world. Howell and Dunnivant, (2002) argued that only when schools have technologically trained teachers and current workable technologies will the technology revolution have an opportunity to truly transform classrooms. Factors that affect students’ performance in Motion lessons According to Keeves and Mrganistern (1992), attitude of the learner affects performance. This was also supported by Anderson (2006) who explained that attitude and achievement are related and that a positive attitude towards science lesson results in a good achievement. Teachers’ content and pedagogical knowledge is a key factor to students’ academic success in today’s classrooms (Darling-Hammond, 2000). Therefore, what teachers know, determines the authenticity of their contribution to teaching and learning of motion. The pedagogical content knowledge of a teacher is also crucial in teaching and learning of concepts in Physics. Other factors that affect students’ performance in Mechanics lesson are: past experiences of the learners, material availability, presentation of concepts and topics in an abstract. This leads to ‘inert knowledge’ knowledge not related to the environment of learners. lack of motivation, time available for teaching and learning, learning strategies students employ and selfefficacy are also identified as factors affecting student performance in physic The importance of Students’ Perceptions on Motion How learners form concepts was a very important issue in science education today. Researches on students’ misconceptions have become a central issue in science education for the past two decades because they are presumed to be instruction-resistant obstacles to the acquisition of scientific concepts (Lawson, 1988). Much research therefore has been focused on what accounts for misconception in science and steps to correct the situation. It is well established in higher education that students arrive at universities with already conceived misconceptions which can exist alongside new conceptions and are marked by being personal in nature, counter intuitive, highly resistant to change and/or contradictory (Wandersee, Mintzes & Novak, 1994). This assertion is also true about students who come to Senior High Schools. The sources of misconception may be diversified. More often than not science teachers’ instructions usually focus on covering all the topics in the course syllabus or manual without a consistent emphasis on integrating across concepts. Physics is an exciting subject that underpins much of modern technology and is vital to the economic wellbeing of the world and to our human appreciation of our true place in the physical universe. Description of the Virtual Physics Lab. (VPLAB) Computer Software are well designed concept-driven packages of instructional materials that support and facilitate teaching and learning in a classroom or laboratories. They are designed to be more adaptable for general use. Teachers could use them as supplement and enhancement of their own teaching methods. The Virtual Physics Laboratory (VPLAB) is an on-line simulation-based learning environment allowing students to conduct ""virtual experiments"" which feature many characteristics and constraints normally associated with real experiments, such as: uncertainty of measuring apparatus, small random fluctuations of parameters, and International Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences ",,2020.0,2,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.31873/ijeas.7.09.17', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31873/ijeas.7.09.17?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31873/ijeas.7.09.17, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As described in [2], “Project Ozma was named after the queen of L. Frank Baum’s imaginary land of Oz—a place ‘very far away, difficult to reach, and populated by strange and exotic beings.’ The stars chosen by Drake for the first SETI search were Tau Ceti in the constellation Cetus (the Whale) and Epsilon Eridani in the constellation Eridanus (the River), some eleven light years (66 trillion miles) away.” He later recalled “For all we knew at the time, almost every star had strong radio signals coming from it. We might look at only a few stars and succeed.” The entire project cost US$2,000 [3]. Drake’s initial attempt in 1960 led to much larger efforts. In the late 1970s, Drake and astronomer Carl Sagan continued the search for extraterrestrial radio signals at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico [3]. In 1999, as I discussed in [4], the SETI@home project was born. The vast amount of data coming from the Arecibo telescope was distributed to volunteers worldwide. During idle moments, their personal computers used a special screensaver program to analyze the data and send the results back to the SETI@ home scientists at the University of California, Berkeley. At its peak, this crowdsourced scientific experiment boasted some 2 million volunteers [5]. Earlier this year, the SETI@home project went into hibernation [5], [6]. The number of volunteers had dwindled to roughly 100,000, but that was not the reason for hitting the pause button on the project. Two reasons were given for this action [6]. First, from a scientific viewpoint, the project had reached a point of diminishing returns; basically, the scientists had analyzed all of the data that they needed for the time being. Second, managing the distributed processing of data is labor intensive. The priority now is to focus on completing the backend analysis of the results they already have and writing it up. Although SETI@home is taking a breather, the search for unnatural radio signals of extraterrestrial origin is actually accelerating. Astrophysicist Andrew Siemion from the SETI Research Center in California [7] told attendees at this year’s American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting that better radio telescopes (e.g., the Very Large Array in New Mexico), faster computers, and the discovery of numerous exoplanets (orbiting other stars) are transforming the field from a fringe activity into a mainstream project. He estimates that the next decade will bring a thousand-fold improvement in the astronomers’ quest for interstellar signals [7]. For SETI enthusiasts, as Carl Sagan was fond of saying, “Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence” [8].",IEEE Antennas & Propagation Magazine,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/74/9161146/09161154.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/map.2020.2998846?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/map.2020.2998846, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7104aa88a4466c418b11290a1475e5aa924bda13,Knowledge discovery of scholarly publications on misinformation on social media: A text mining approach,"Social media is a remarkable outcome of Web 2.0 technology, which is very popular among the Internet users. The general public is using social media as a communication media to fulfil their information requirements on various occasions such as disaster communication, health communication, marketing products and services and political campaigns. However, the openness of social media provides a great platform for misinformation sharing which is a very common problem in social media communication. Hence, the main objectives of this study are to analyse the publication year and total citation count of publications on misinformation on social media and to identify the main disciplines of misinformation studies on social media using the text mining technique. The primary data of this study were extracted from the Web of Science database using the keywords; social media, misinformation, disinformation and fake news on 16th April 2020. The WoS provided 62 search results and all 62 articles were considered in this study. The title of the article, journal, published year, total citation, abstract, author keywords, keywords plus, Web of Science categories, and research areas were extracted from WoS database. The text mining was done manually. According to the results, scholarly publications on misinformation on social media were first published in the year 2012. Scholarly publications were categorized into 10 main categories; Information, Media, Medical information, Social Science, Communication, Health information, Computer science, Other Sciences, Engineering and Management and Finance.

She has a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and her research areas are Dynamic and Stochastic Programming and Parallel Computing to solve mathematical optimization problems applied to logistics and supply chain. Dr. Novoa has 19 years of experience in academia and 4 years of experience in industry. Dr. Novoa is receiving funding from NSF through Texas State STEM Rising Stars (2015-2019) and ME-Green: Manufacturing for the Environment by Generating Renewable Energy in Enterprise Networks (2017-2020). Texas State STEM Rising Stars is a four-years grant related to increase the ﬁrst and second year retention and graduation rates of students in STEM. ME- Green is a three-years grant to model and design a grid-connected onsite generation system featuring renewable power to realize zero-carbon industrial operations. Dr. Novoa has been also committed to research on strategies to achieve gender equity and cultural inclusiveness in science and engineering. 23 include: Professional & International Education: architecture and construction Experiential Education: study abroad, internships Virtual Design, Construction environments Abstract A diagnostic of thirty questions administered to incoming STEM students in Fall 2013 and Fall 2015 - Fall 2018 reflects that their spatial visualization skills (SVS) need to be improved. Previous studies in the SVS subject [1], [2], [3] report that well-developed SVS skills lead to students’ success in Engineering and Technology, Computer Science, Chemistry, Computer Aided Design and Mathematics. Authors [4], [5] mention that aptitude in spatial skills is gradually becoming a standard assessment of an individual’s likelihood to succeed as an engineer. This research reports the qualitative and quantitative results of a project designed to improve SVS’s for STEM students managed under two strategies. The first strategy utilized was a series of face-to-face (FtF), two-hour training sessions taught over six weeks to all majors in STEM. This strategy was offered in Spring 2014 and every semester from Fall 2015 - Spring 2018. The second strategy was an embedded training (ET) implemented by one faculty from Fall 2017- Fall 2018. The faculty embedded the training in the US 1100 freshman seminar and was highly motivated to increase awareness of students on the importance and applicability of SVS in their fields of study. As reported by Swail et al. [6], cognitive, social, and institutional factors are key elements to best support students’ persistence and achievement. Both interventions used in this project encompassed all these factors and were supported by an NSF IUSE grant (2015-2019) to improve STEM retention.",,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.jee.org/35200.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--35200?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--35200, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9fc59c8177034d4c870a0a9f98a00493b928ea72,A bearer of good news.,"“Summer is on its way and my partner and I managed to grow this rose which has a wonderful scent.” A picture of a beautiful orange flower accompanied the note—part of a weekly email sharing good news with the members of our research center. One year ago, an announcement like this could have seemed insignificant and irrelevant to the important work of science. But amid the difficulties of 2020, it was anything but. It put a smile on my face, and hopefully it did the same for my colleagues. It helped build human connection. And it reminded us that, even this year, good things happened.



> “Highlighting the positive moments … helped keep our spirits up.” 

Last year, the director of the research center in Australia where I serve as the business strategy manager asked me to help maintain a positive, productive culture. Back then, I didn't anticipate that the task was going to be so difficult. Then, of course, came 2020.

During the first half of the year, Australia experienced an extreme drought followed by devastating bushfires and heavy rainfall that brought massive flooding. Next came the pandemic. With people not coming in to the lab or staying only long enough to conduct their experiments, we lost our sense of interpersonal connection. Then, in July, our director shared that she had been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer.

In the wake of that devastating announcement, one of the center's group leaders suggested we send our director weekly good news to keep her informed and to try to lift her spirits. One week later, we sent the first email. The rule was that no good news was too small to share. We reported the arrival of much-needed new computers for one lab, one of our group leaders being contacted by a journalist for their expert opinion on viruses in the context of the pandemic, a student submitting their thesis, a paper being published, and a group leader securing child care spots for their children.

The effect of this simple newsletter—which went to all the group leaders as well as our director—was profound. Many people responded, saying they enjoyed this informal venue for learning about their colleagues' successes. The flood of negative news had kept us from noticing the good things that were happening. Highlighting the positive moments didn't mean we were ignoring the larger catastrophes, but it helped keep our spirits up. I also realized that, prior to the newsletter, some group members didn't know about others' successes. Sharing these updates more publicly gave everyone a boost. After a few weeks, we decided to broaden the recipient list to include everyone at the center.

These days, we solicit good news every Wednesday and send out an email every Friday. The process and format are simple and no-frills, making the newsletter sustainable. At first I worried that people might be hesitant to share updates that seemed too insignificant, but the opposite has been true; they have been eager to highlight their endeavors and successes, big and small, professional and personal. Good news we've shared includes securing grants and fellowships, publishing papers, becoming parents, turning 40, and—of course—growing roses on one's balcony. “I love good news time,” a colleague wrote after a recent email. “It really is uplifting.”

Last month, one group leader's good news was that, after breaking his arm, he finally had his cast removed. The next week, he reported that his daughter broke her arm and offered the tongue-in-cheek hypothesis that the number of broken bones in his family is a conserved quantity. It wasn't exactly good news, but the joke made me chuckle. Equally important, it's personal news, and sharing it helps us stay connected in these difficult times.

With 2020 drawing to a close, we can hope for better things in 2021. But regardless of what the future holds, we plan to continue to share our good news.",Science,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.370.6523.1522?download=true', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1126/science.370.6523.1522?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1126/science.370.6523.1522, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c6401f67060379e92d2a5fb4c1a4f1e77f40e378,Inaugural Issue Editorial,"Welcome to the inaugural issue of the ACM/IMS Transactions on Data Science (TDS). When I started working with the ACM Publications Board several years ago to develop this journal, ACM had not yet spoken to the Institute for Mathematical Statistics (IMS) about a possible publishing collaboration. However, in early 2019, ACM and IMS began discussions about co-sponsoring an interdisciplinary meeting that would appeal to both organizations’ communities. Those discussions quickly progressed and ultimately led to the ACM-IMS Interdisciplinary Summit on the Foundations of Data Science. This meeting took place June 15, 2019, at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, co-chaired by Jeannette Wing and David Madigan from Columbia University. After the success of this first event, both organizations agreed to follow it up with the ACM-IMS Foundations of Data Science Conference (FODS’20), which will take place October 18–20, 2020, in Seattle. In addition, following last year’s successful event, both organizations began to discuss the possibility of co-publishing a truly interdisciplinary journal for the statistics, computer science, and machine learning communities. As by that time, I was already well on my way to launching this first inaugural issue, we decided it would make the most sense to join forces with IMS as soon as possible. I am now pleased to present the publication of the inaugural issue of the co-published journal. The ACM and IMS collaboration will have several strategic and practical benefits for the scientific community and journal. First, the journal will be published Gold Open Access from day one: All papers will be published in front of the paywall inside the ACM Digital Library. In the early years of the publication, TDS authors will have the option, but not be required, to pay Article Processing Charges (APCs) to support the costs of publishing TDS articles in an Open Access format. Second, over the coming months, I will be working with IMS and ACM to bring on board two additional co-editors-in-chief to help lead the journal, one from the Statistics community and the other from the Machine Learning community. As we identify these co-editors-in-chief and they join the editorial board of TDS, we will be making additional editorial board appointments from these communities. Data science is fundamentally a multidisciplinary field that uses statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and their relevant technology, systems, theory, and methods to understand data and extract insights from data for data-driven decision making and inferencing. All of these changes will be good for the journals, our authors, and the community. The scope of TDS includes cross-disciplinary innovative research ideas, algorithms, systems, theory, and applications for data science. The journal will seek out and accept submissions that address challenges at every stage, from acquisition on, through data cleaning, transformation, representation, integration, indexing, modeling, analysis, visualization, and interpretation, while retaining privacy, fairness, provenance, transparency, and provision of social benefit, within the context of big data.",Trans.

bbf155d150daa09a6f3e363bcdb72e13b9ea625d,21st Century International Higher Education Hotspots,"The Institute of International Education (IIE) 2018 Open Doors report highlighted that the United States is the leading international education destination, having hosted about 1.1 million international students in 2017 (IIE, 2018a). Despite year over year increases, U.S. Department of State (USDOS, 2018) data show that for a third year in a row, international student visa issuance is down. This is not the first decline. Student visa issuance for long-term academic students on F visas also significantly dropped following the 9/11 attacks (Johnson, 2018). The fall in issuances recovered within 5 years of 2001 and continued to steadily increase until the drop in 2016. 
Taken together, the drops in international student numbers indicate a softening of the U.S. international education market. In 2001, the United States hosted one out of every three globally mobile students, but by 2018 it hosted just one of five (IIE, 2018b). This suggests that over the past 20 years, the United States has lost a share of mobile students in the international education market because they’re enrolled elsewhere. 
The Rise of Nontraditional Education Destination Countries 
Unlike the United States, the percentage of inbound students to other traditional destinations such as Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, has remained stable since the turn of the 21st century. Meanwhile, nontraditional countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Russia are garnering more students and rising as educational hotspots (Knight, 2013). The UAE and Russia annually welcome thousands of foreign students, respectively hosting over 53,000 and 194,000 inbound international university students in 2017 (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2019). This is not happenstance. In the past 5 years, these two countries, among others, have adopted higher education internationalization policies, immigration reforms, and academic excellence initiatives to attract foreign students from around the world. 
The UAE is one of six self-identified international education hubs in the world (Knight, 2013) and with 42 international universities located across the emirates, it has the most international branch campuses (IBCs) worldwide (Cross-Border Education Research Team, 2017). Being a country composed of nearly 90% immigrants, IBCs allow the UAE to offer quality higher education to its non-Emirati population and to attract students from across the Arab region and broader Muslim world. National policy and open regulations not only encourage foreign universities to establish IBCs, they alsoattract international student mobility (Ilieva, 2017). For example, on November 24, 2018, the national government updated immigration policy to allow foreign students to apply for 5-year visas (Government.ae, 2018). The Centennial 2071 strategic development plan aims for the UAE to become a regional and world leader in innovation, research, and education (Government.ae, 2019), with the long-term goal of creating the conditions necessary to attract foreign talent. 
Russia’s strategic agenda also intends to gain a greater competitive advantage in the world economy by improving its higher education and research capacity. Russia currently has two higher education internationalization policies: “5-100-2020” and “Export Education.” The academic excellence project, known as “5-100-2020,” funds leading institutions with the goal to advance five Russian universities into the top 100 globally by 2020 (Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation, 2018). The “Export Education” initiative mandates that all universities double or triple the number of enrolled foreign students to over half a million by 2025 (Government.ru, 2017). These policies are explicitly motivated by boosting the Russian higher education system and making it more open to foreigners. Another growing area is international cooperation. Unlike the UAE, Russia has few IBCs, but at present, Russian universities partner with European and Asian administrators and government delegates to create dual degree and short-term programs. Historically, Russia has been a leading destination for work and education migrants from soviet republics in the region, but new internationalization policies are meant to propel the country into the international education market and to attract international students beyond Asia and Europe. 
Future Trends in 21st Century International Education 
Emerging destination hotspots like the UAE and Russia are vying to become more competitive in the global international higher education market by offering quality education at lower tuition rates in safe, welcoming locations closer to home. As suggested by the softening of the U.S. higher education market, international students may find these points attractive when considering where to study. Sociopolitical shifts that result from events such as 9/11 or the election of Donald Trump in combination with student mobility recruitment initiatives in emerging destinations may disrupt the status quo for traditional countries by rerouting international student enrollment to burgeoning educational hotspots over the coming decades.",,2020.0,7,"{'url': 'https://www.ojed.org/index.php/jis/article/download/1851/931', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32674/jis.v10i1.1851?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32674/jis.v10i1.1851, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8f3190fff457c240c9e031d278a1d5fdc6541843,Robotics and Artificial Intelligence [From the Editor's Desk],"One hundred years ago, the Czech writer Karel Čapek gave us the word “robot,” which first appeared in his play R.U.R. in 1920 (although, later, he identified his brother Josef as the actual source of the term). Long before science fiction became recognized as a separate genre, Čapek wrote plays and novels in which he discussed ethical aspects of industrial inventions and processes, including mass production and robots. His robots were not exactly robots as we think of them today; they were living flesh-andblood creatures rather than assemblages of m e c h a n i c a l c omponents and electronics. Last year, I was invited for a debate following a performance of the famous play. A century after its creation, the theme of robots, in whatever form, is more topical than ever. While man increasingly plays God, his creation threatens to take over more and more. R.U.R. is as visionary as it is relevant, as tragic as it is comical, and as unlikely as it is frightening. Currently, the media talk about an explosion of major breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In 1956, American computer scientist John McCarthy organized the Dartmouth Conference, at which the term artificial intelligence was adopted. But ideas that led to the concept of an electronic brain came much earlier, with, e.g., Claude Shannon’s work on digital signals or Alan Turing’s theory of computation. Despite well-funded global efforts early on, governments and corporations began to lose faith in AI. Computers were not well developed enough to process such a large magnitude of data. The so-called AI winter happened from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, when computer scientists dealt with an acute shortage of funding for AI research. The exponential gain in processing power, storage, and network capabilities offered companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Google, Baidu, and others opportunities to leverage AI to their huge commercial advantage for many (often invisible to the general public) applications in daily life. This did not go unnoticed by governments. In 2019, the White House launched the American AI Initiative, which articulates a comprehensive vision for U.S. leadership in the technology. China is spending growing sums on AI research and development. Europe is also increasing its investments and in February published a white paper aiming to foster a European ecosystem of excellence and trust in AI. Among the general public, a robot is often regarded as being the same as AI and vice versa. We often define a robot as a physical machine with sensors and actuators that may or may not require intelligence to perform specific tasks, whereas AI is a program, so it doesn’t need to be physical. But developments in robotics bring additional perspectives to the integration of AI because robots’ physical nature enables them to become increasingly capable of perceiving, acting upon, and shaping their environment and engaging in social interaction. On the other hand, AI enables robots to evolve and learn. No wonder that robotics and AI become more and more intertwined and that, for example, there are many sessions on deep learning at our IEEE Robotics and Automation Society conferences. In its Coordinated Plan, the European Commission defines AI as “systems that display intelligent behavior by analyzing their environment and taking action—with some degree of autonomy—to achieve specific goals.” That sounds like a possible definition of a robot, no? For the European Commission, robotics is regarded as part of AI, and AI is used as an umbrella term for deep learning, neural networks, prediction, machine translation, natural language processing, computer vision, artificial agents, and robotics.

dc830c97dce9c830857843ed58b3fb87b8b1324c,50 Years of Systems Analysis of Energy Development In The Ussr And Russia,"This year replete with so many anniversaries related to the energy sector sees the centenary celebration of the GOELRO Plan. This event is remarkable for energy studies: a complex energy method that backed up the Plan development half a century later became one of the preconditions for the development of the methodology of systems analysis of the energy development. The groundwork of this methodology was laid at SEI/ESI SB RAS (Siberian Energy Institute. Melentiev Energy Systems Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences) founded by Academician L.A. Melentiev; the institute celebrates its 60th anniversary this year. Half a century ago, an 'off-site' department of the SEI was established in Moscow and 15 years later it was reorganized into ERI RAS (Energy Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences) and GKNT (State Committee for Science and Technology). The paper focuses on the background of the development of the theory and methods of systems analysis of energy development, covers its main theoretical and applied contributions in two stages of social and economic development of the country, discusses evolution of this research area and its possible adoption in the alternative (mobilization-type and liberal) concepts of shaping 'the information society’ of the future. Index Terms — GOELRO plan; systems analysis of the energy sector; methods and applications; further research directions. ___________________________________________________ * Corresponding author.

IntroductIon The first-ever long-term outlook of the energy development as treated in conjunction with the economy, the plan of the State Commission for Electrification of Russia (GOELRO Plan) [1], proved a game-changer in managing the economy. Materials backing up the Plan attest to the back then advanced statements of scientific problems and techniques for validation of efficient solutions. Sixty years later, L.A. Melentiev would note that the GOELRO Plan laid foundations of “...the main ideology behind economic planning based on scientific understanding of the energy industry as a unified whole and electrification as the key driver of economic development” [2]. Harsh experience of Stalin's five-year plans, the Second World War, and restoration of the national economy that followed all demonstrated the huge mobilization potential of the planned economy and that of its fuel-and-energy basis but failed to contribute to any breakthroughs in the development of the methodology and means of planning. As late as in the mid-1960s the conditions for a quantum leap in methods and tools for planning the energy development as a prerequisite for economic development, namely: • The awareness of the energy industry as an aggregation of processes of production, conversion, distribution, and consumption of energy resources (fossil fuels, hydropower, wind and solar energy, etc.) and all types of energy on a par with understanding the energy balance as a method for the complex quantitative and qualitative depiction of the production and consumption of all types of energy and fuels in the national economy as a whole, its industries, and the country’s districts [3]; • The mathematical theory and methods developed by L.V. Kantorovich for searching the extreme points of convex functions in the multi-dimensional space of linear constraints and their economic interpretation [4] opened the way to stating and solving challenging problems of the optimum management and planning of economic development, including optimization of fuel and energy balances; Energy Systems Research, Vol. 3, No. 2, 2020 A.

Makarov 45 • The introduction of computers [5], their application to research and development reduced computational efforts needed for implementation of the first (calculation of energy balances of production and consumption for all types of energy resources throughout the country) and especially so of the second prerequisites (optimization of the above processes in the course of energy sector development and operation). The novel methodological and computational basis made the 1960s the ""Sturm und Drang"" age in the development of economic and mathematical models and methods for optimization of decisions, on a par with efforts to apply them to the country's energy industry management. Researchers at the Siberian Energy Institute of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences proposed a mathematical model for optimum energy development planning that was adapted to industries of the energy sector and country’s regions. II. theory, methods, and applIcatIons of systems analysIs of the energy development In the ussr Methodologies behind systems analysis study such objects and phenomena of the real world that: Possess properties of the whole that cannot be reduced to a sum of properties of their elements; Have elaborate internal and external relations and synergy effects of interrelations of elements that constitute the main factors of the system’s efficiency growth: concentration, centralization, combination, and specialization of the main components of their economic activity; Include an object, organizational bodies, and mechanisms (including financial ones) of control that are, as a rule, have a sophisticated hierarchical structure; Obey the principle of least action, which requires optimization of the decisions to be made; Have an uncertain future, which generates risks with respect to decisions made and requires adaptive control over their operation and development. Identification of a mix and interrelations of systems that serve as a backbone of human activities by supplying all types of energy and the study of their current state and prospects to improve their efficiency are the subject of energy systems analysis. Focus on the mathematical statement (modeling) of a specific problem while factoring in all its aspects and relations underlies the methodology for systems studies in general and for those of energy development in particular. It took several years to correctly represent the diversity of fuel and energy types, sources of their production, transportation routes to consumers, the variety of technologies and modes (daily, weekly, yearly) of their production, processing, and consumption in terms of a formal linear programming problem solved by the L.V. Kantorovich [4] method. It was even more difficult to formalize the unfolding of those processes in time to take into account the renovation and decommissioning of operating plants and construction of new ones, which, in turn, required a description of products and processes in the linked economic sectors. The optimum solution to this enormously complex problem had to be searched under uncertain values of all the numerical indicators used in the model (Fig. 1). The complete problem statement does not exist, and up to the early 1970s, we saw the chaotic proliferation of the problems of optimization of different parts of energy industry development. An All-Union Symposium held at the SEI in 1970 initiated the process of creating the theories and methods of systems analysis of energy industry development. Large energy systems (LES) were construed as hierarchically organized man-machine systems of complex structures that operated under incomplete information [6]. Dozens of articles and local publications followed, they discussed theoretical problems, methods, and tools (mathematical models) for studying the LES structures and properties and solving a wide range of problems related to their development. Scientific and methodological aspects of those works as applied to the optimum planning of energy development were generalized in the monograph [7], and the possibility of their use in planning and engineering were first formalized in guiding documents. Efforts to build the automated system for plan calculations (ASPC) of the USSR Gosplan (State Planning Committee) opened the way to a radical change in the economic development planning, and the energy industry was a leader in the development of systems of cross-industry complexes. As a result, by the end of the 1970s, a coherent and full-fledged school of systems research as applied to the energy industry was established in the USSR. The focus of the research was on the current state of the energy sector and power industry of the USSR and prospects for their development for 10-15 years, the features of fuel supply to the country's regions. The research also involved an analysis of the stability of marginal fuel costs by country' region, and the identification of values to be recommended as a tool for coordinating the results of various fuel and energy calculations in the energy sector subject to its optimum development. The systems approach extended its scope to control over the development of the electric power and heat industries, to the nuclear energy system, to gas supply systems, and to relations between energy and economic development. Preparation for the adoption of systems analysis methods for energy development was finalized by the elaboration of the first phase of the ""Energy sector"" subsystem of the ASPC o",,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.38028/esr.2020.02.0006', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38028/esr.2020.02.0006?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38028/esr.2020.02.0006, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods: We developed and validated a population-level predictionmodel of need for early intervention in psychosis [EIP] services using small-area level neighbourhood data in England up to 2025. Briefly, we combined small area incidence data on FEP, aged 16-64 years from empirical studies with prior information on psychosis risk by age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and cannabis use. We tested six different Bayesian Poisson models for fit of this data to 2017 small-area populations of England, and compared our FEP predictions against observed national data. The best-fitting model was extrapolated to predict need for EIP care between 2019-2025, using small-area population projections. Results: A model with age-sex interaction, ethnicity, small-area level deprivation, social fragmentation and regional cannabis use provided best internal and apparent validity, predicting 8112 (95% CrI: 7623-8597) FEP cases in England in 2017, compared with 8038 observed cases (difference: n=74; 0.94%). Apparent validity was acceptable at local levels, and by sex and ethnicity, although we observed greater-than-expected need before 35 years old. Predicted FEP cases rose between 2019-2025 by 6.2% to 9,541 new cases per year in line with demographic changes. Discussion: Our translational epidemiological tool provides an accurate, validated method to informmental health planners about future population need for psychosis care based on individual and small-area level determinants of need. Such tools can be used to enhance resource allocation in public mental health.

6beca7e36e1186cbba6ef3d64903fdd29eca36e0,Mentoring Millennials.,"The surgical case was straightforward: a young man had experienced a radial nerve injury from a broken humerus, now without neurological recovery. Tendon transfers to restore wrist and finger extension were planned. The surgeon, resident, and medical student approached the scrub sink together to review major teaching points, potential pitfalls, and contingency plans in case of complications. As the surgeon reached for a scrub brush, the medical student lingered back, his thumbs incessantly and rhythmically tapping on the screen of his phone. The surgeon peered at him with frustration, annoyed that again his student appeared more interested in his smartphone than the pathology. In an effort to engage him back to the case, the surgeon asked: “Can you tell me what tendons lie in each of the extensor compartments in the hand?” The student’s head snapped up, and he quickly rattled off the answer with ease. Smiling momentarily, he then asked, “Could I get your thoughts on this new video describing nerve transfers rather than tendon transfers for radial nerve injuries that was just uploaded to our educational portal? See, I have it pulled up right here, it was just presented last week at the plenary session...” Generational diversity describes the shared perspectives and experiences among individuals born within boundaries of time, such as the silent generation (19251945), the baby boomers (1946-1964), and Generation X (1965-1980).1 Individuals entering medicine today were born between 1980 and 2000, termed millennials. Millennials comprise about 25% of today’s workforce and will account for 40% and 75% of the workforce in 2020 and 2025, respectively. We recognize that these assertions do not apply to every member of a particular generation. Nevertheless, the values, expectations, and ethos that define millennials are perceived as substantially different from their predecessors and have caught the attention, and concern, of older generations. This is particularly true in medicine where training, advancement, and mentorship are steeped in tradition and where change often comes slowly. Millennials have been shaped by a profound expansion of information technology, enhanced social networking, and a connected global culture. Although sometimes labeled as impatient, distracted, overly socialized, and entitled, millennials could also be characterized as deeply empowered, collaborative, and innovative. These generalizations, however, can lead to conflict and misunderstanding, particularly in environments such as hospitals where apprenticeship and hierarchy are the norm. Mentorship is the cornerstone of academic medicine. A mentor is defined as an advisor characterized by altruism, expertise, patience, and experience. In many ways, graduate medical education has adapted to millennials through the expansion of online and videobased learning resources, disease-based educational curricula, abbreviated work hours, and team-based care models.2 However, mentorship strategies for millennial faculty members, residents, and medical students are not well understood. Indeed, we have personally witnessed generational differences leading to frustration, miscommunication, and attrition in these mentormentee dyads. Consider 3 common scenarios. Example 1. Susan is a junior faculty member drafting her career development award with her division chief, Mary, as primary mentor. Their offices are in close proximity; Susan often drops in throughout the day between Mary’s meetings to ask questions on the wording. Mary finds this irritating, as it circumvents the usual scheduling channels. Susan is annoyed that Mary seems to have little time for her. Theme 1. As Needed vs Scheduled Engagement. Millennials have grown up with virtually instant communication and information dissemination. Such engagement facilitates quick decision making and expands collaboration networks. Millennials expect accessibility, fast responses, rapid turnaround, and frequent short meetings to ensure clear direction. Senior mentors often balance administrative, clinical, and academic demands with greater structure and less ad hoc availability. Combined, this leads to frustration and stress for both parties. Example 2. John is a third-year medical student conducting a summer project examining the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques on cardiovascular risk in patients following myocardial infarction. He has a question about the survey data collection and sends a group email to Sam, a junior faculty member directly supervising the project, and to Mark, the chairman of the department who will serve as a senior author on the project. Mark is annoyed that Sam isn’t taking care of the question; Sam is embarrassed that John emailed the chair directly, and John is frustrated that no one appears to be answering his question. Theme 2. Flat vs Pyramidal Infrastructure. Millennials embrace collaboration and cognitive diversity more readily than prior generations.3 In some aspects of academic medicine, these attributes will serve them well. For example, team science, multidisciplinary care, and collective leadership are welcomed by millennials who embrace groupthink, in contrast to their senior counterparts. However, flattening social and hierarchical gaps may also lead to conflict. Millennials do not necessarily embrace the siloed communication typical of traditional academic departments. Removing these barriers can cause frustration among older physicians accustomed to hierarchical communication channels and younger physicians who desire broad access to all stakeholders. Example 3.

Construction Managers (CMs) and Construction Project Managers (CPMs) registered with the South African Council for the Project and Construction Management Professions (SACPCMP) were surveyed by means of an online survey to determine the status quo with respect to newly graduated construction managers. In terms of findings, graduates were rated: average to good / good in terms of overall performance, however, marginally so; marginally below average in terms of their performance relative to the functions of management work; highest relative to computer literacy, numeracy, and trust and honesty in terms of attributes / skills during probation; highest relative to computer literacy, numeracy, and written communication after probation; highest relative to construction technology, construction science, and research methodology in terms of knowledge areas, and highest relative to personal integrity in terms of ten core competencies. Conclusions include: graduates are employable; challenges exist in terms of newly graduated Construction Managers, and tertiary built environment education must enhance graduates’ attributes, knowledge, skills, core competencies, and emotional intelligence (EI). Recommendations include: tertiary institutions should ensure that graduates are well versed and developed during their four-year study period; emphasis should be placed on developing core competencies and EI; employers should subject graduates to graduate training programmes; the interface between industry and tertiary education should be optimised through forums, and students should undertake construction-related vacation work and generic part-time work. © 2020 The Authors.

32d184b1806d0423a8c0067a85d3f2037c505d1c,Research and Development of Higher Mathematics Teaching in Colleges Based on Student Ability Training,"In the information age, the rise and application of new technologies have been infiltrated into all aspects of people's lives and changed people's working and living habits. The study of higher mathematics is mainly to solve the practical problems in professional study. The actual problems are described in mathematical language or model images to simplify the actual problems and solve the problems. Therefore, in the teaching of higher mathematics, how to deal with the relationship between knowledge and ability is very important, not only to teach students the basic theoretical knowledge, but also to guide students through the integration of knowledge and systematic analysis to solve professional problems. This paper firstly expounds the current teaching situation of higher mathematics in colleges, and then puts forward methods and strategies to improve colleges' ability to practice mathematics in order to improve college students' ability to apply mathematics. Introduction With the rapid development of computer technology, the mathematical technology developed in harmony with it has also been profoundly affected; At the same time, the development of mathematics has provided a powerful impetus for the development of high technology. In the process of solving practical problems, mathematics plays an irreplaceable role in other disciplines. It is based on this feature that each college student puts forward higher requirements, that is, the basis for mastering the basic principles and professional knowledge of higher mathematics. In the past, the application of mathematics to solving practical problems is aimed at improving the students' ability in practical application of mathematics. higher mathematics is a highly applicable discipline, which plays an advantage that other disciplines cannot match when solving practical problems in real life. However, when college set up higher mathematics teaching, it often only paid attention to the theoretical, rigorous, and test-oriented nature of mathematics, and ignored the cultivation of students' practical application of mathematics. Such teaching concepts and teaching methods are in line with the application-oriented talents required by the current society Divergence. Higher mathematics can train students 'logical thinking ability and ability to analyze problems. Therefore, College teachers should focus on cultivating students' ability to apply mathematics, and treat advanced mathematics as a basic compulsory course for new students, laying a foundation for the later professional courses. This paper will combine the current situation of developing students' mathematical application ability with higher mathematics teaching, analyze the reasons for students' poor mathematical application ability, and focus on how to strengthen higher mathematics teaching, improve the teaching structure, and effectively cultivate students' application ability. 1. The Status Quo of College Students' Application of Higher Mathematics In recent years, many colleges have begun to expand enrollment, and the gap between students has become wider and wider. By investigating the current teaching status of several college higher mathematics, now, some students have a slack mentality in the study of high numbers; don’t pay attention to the study of mathematics content, and only deal with daily learning and examinations for graduation. In addition, sophomores and juniors in universities attach great importance to practice and arrange most of the basic theoretical courses in the freshman year. Therefore, the 2020 Conference on Educational Science and Educational Skills (ESES2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000636 ISBN: 978-1-80052-003-5 -468curriculum is very compact. Teachers only pay attention to the knowledge that should be given to students within the prescribed time. In a short time, it neglected the cultivation of students' thinking ability and independent thinking ability, which affected the future development of students. In many colleges, students are susceptible to the deep-rooted influence of teachers. They follow the teacher's problem-solving ideas and thinking methods, and do various exercises to meet the needs of the exam. They do not really learn the essence of mathematical knowledge and hinder the cultivation of student logic thinking ability and independent thinking ability also restrict students 'ability to apply higher mathematics to real life. Therefore, teachers in higher schools must first improve their own qualities in order to cultivate students' ability to apply mathematics [1-5]. 2. The Relationship between College Students' Mathematical Application Ability and Higher Mathematics Teaching Mathematical application ability is a very complex cognitive skill. It is analyzed from its psychological representation. Basic mathematical cognitive operations include mathematical abstraction, logical reasoning, and modeling. Therefore, the basic components of mathematical application ability are mathematical abstraction ability, logical reasoning ability, and mathematical modeling ability. Complex mathematical application abilities consist of them. For example, mathematical proof ability and mathematical calculation ability are composed of a series of logical reasoning. In the process of solving practical problems, it is often necessary to comprehensively use a variety of different basic knowledge operations to complete. In college, the growth of mathematical knowledge and the enhancement of mathematical application ability of students outside the major of mathematics are realized through the teaching of higher mathematics. From this we can draw the following important conclusions: In the teaching of higher mathematics, in order to strengthen the cultivation of students' mathematical application ability, there are two ""must do""[6-8]. First, we must attach importance to knowledge transfer and construct an optimized and practical knowledge structure of higher mathematics, which is the basis for the cultivation of applied ability. Second, we must strengthen the practice, which is a necessary way to strengthen students' ability to apply mathematics. They are the keys to strengthening students' ability to apply mathematics. The relationship between college students' mathematical application ability and higher mathematics teaching is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Cognition of the relationship between college students' mathematical application ability and higher mathematics teaching Nowadays, when higher education enters the stage of popularization, as mentioned in the introduction, in the local common college, especially in ordinary colleges, due to the sharp increase in the number of students, a considerable number of students have poor mathematical foundation. In the teaching of higher mathematics, the phenomenon of neglecting capacity-building has intensified, and the reduction of heuristics has seriously affected the functioning of capacity-building. This practice of weakening ability training to increase knowledge transmission is contrary to the law of cognition. It will only make students rote, memorize, and worsen their ability, which is not in line with the educational goals of education. Therefore, how to properly handle the relationship between imparting knowledge and cultivating ability, and strengthening the cultivation of students' ability to 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Strong Stronger general weak Weaker Learning ability",2020 Conference on Educational Science and Educational Skills (ESES2020),2020.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38007/proceedings.0000636?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38007/proceedings.0000636, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Still there has been large deficiency of agricultural water during the period other than the short duration rainy/ monsoon season, which provides enough rainfall for few months only. Due to the large spatial and temporal variability in the rainfall, water resources distribution in the country is highly skewed. The per capita availability of water, which was 1901 cubic meter (cu m) per year in 2001, considering the population of 1027 million and renewable water resources as 1953 billion cubic meters (b cu m), will International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences ISSN: 2319-7706 Volume 9 Number 4 (2020) Journal homepage: http://www.ijcmas.com Due to the large spatial and temporal variability in the rainfall, water resources distribution in the country is highly skewed.

411d9005a0fc62473b2cdee5e4aa90bd8c4beb62,Reorienting Agricultural Education System in India,"In order to revitalize Indian education system, the Government of India has recently approved National Education Policy-2020 (NEP-2020) and proposed sweeping changes including opening up of Indian higher education to foreign universities, dismantling of the UGC and the AICTE, introduction of a 4-year multidisciplinary undergraduate program with multiple exit options, and discontinuation of the M Phil program. It aims at making ‘India a global knowledge superpower’. In the light of National Education Policy-2020, agricultural education system needs to be redefined in India as it increases knowledge or information and farmer’s capacity to learn. As the level of agricultural education increases, farmers will become more and more self-reliant and will depend more on their self-studies dealing with farming. It is suggested that reorientation of agricultural higher education in context of globalization, food security, diversification, sustainability of ecosystems, and agribusiness is necessary. The curriculum of agricultural higher education needs to be made more broad based and manpower has to be trained scientifically in topics such as biotechnology, genetic engineering, agro-meteorology, environmental science, agro-ecology, computer application, information technology, conservation of natural and human resources, specialized job-oriented courses, and trade and export in agribusiness. Finally, adequate emphasis should be placed on practical skills and entrepreneurial capabilities among the students to achieve excellence. To properly address the challenges faced by today’s Indian agriculture, competent human resource in sufficiently large numbers would be required in the near future. There is a vast scope for young graduates to undertake agriculture as their profession which is directly or indirectly contributing to the economic and social development of the country.",,2020.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21921/jas.v7i03.18684?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21921/jas.v7i03.18684, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1060b18f79d5742e46a69a9db5d1d2f4beefca6f,A Study on Training Data Selection for Object Detection in Nighttime Traffic Scenes,"With the growing demand for robust object detection algorithms in self-driving systems, it is important to consider the varying lighting and weather conditions in which cars operate all year round. The goal of our work is to gain a deeper understanding of meaningful strategies for selecting and merging training data from currently available databases and self-annotated videos in the context of automotive night scenes. We retrain an existing Convolutional Neural Network (YOLOv3) to study the influence of different training dataset combinations on the final object detection results in nighttime and low-visibility traffic scenes. Our evaluation shows that a suitable selection of training data from the GTSRD, VIPER, and BDD databases in conjunction with selfrecorded night scenes can achieve an mAP of 63,5% for ten object classes, which is an improvement of 16,7% when compared to the performance of the original YOLOv3 network on the same test set. Introduction As autonomous driving technology evolves from advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to true self-driving systems, the demand for robust object detection algorithms is continuously increasing. Cars operate under varying circumstances throughout the year, during different seasons and different times of day. However, publicly available databases of traffic scenes that provide training data for deep learning algorithms are traditionally biased towards daylight and environments with good visibility. Even though the incorporation of night scenes in training datasets has recently started receiving more attention [12], [10], the manual annotation of night scenes with demanding illumination conditions is tedious and time-consuming. The challenge is to find suitable combinations of previously existing and new datasets for training, while keeping the required amount of newly annotated data from the specific target application as low as possible. In our study, we explore this question in the context of object detection in nighttime and low-visibility traffic scenes. After a review of related literature, we describe the used datasets and our training and evaluation cycles. We then present experimental results obtained from gradual amplification of our training dataset in various test cycles. Related Work The application of deep learning techniques on nighttime traffic scenes is currently gaining attention. Several publications have been tailored to specific object classes in night scenes. For example, Kim et al. [6] study the detection of humans, and Lim et al. [5] concentrate on traffic sign recognition under illumination variations. Contrarily, our work seeks to detect a broad range of objects that usually appear in nighttime or low-visibility traffic scenes. A previous work by Anoosheh et al. [13] proposed to establish a relation between scene representations to overcome the lack of annotated nighttime data. With regards to the YOLO network, Tung et al. [9] examine YOLO’s ability to detect objects in shifting illumination conditions. However, the authors do not retrain the network, which is the focus of our work. Our goal is to retrain an existing object detector in order to create a stable object detector, which can detect objects in varying lighting situations. We decided to retrain YOLO (You Only Look Once) [7], which is considered one of the state-of-the-art object detectors. Redmon et al. [11] found that YOLO outperformed several object detection methods, in terms of both accuracy and speed. The comparison uses the COCO dataset [1], which we also use as a baseline in our study. Datasets Our work relies on retraining an existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to study the influence of different data set selections and combinations on the recognition of objects in night scenes. We successively augment our training data set in view of our target application, which focuses on automotive night scenes. The following sections describe the data base and its usage in our training and evaluation cycles. Four datasets were used in our study: The German Traffic Sign Recognition Database (GTSRD), VIsual PERception benchmark (VIPER), Berkeley Deep Drive 100k (BDD), as well as our own recordings, taken within the CarVisionLight (CVL) project. We review the main characteristics of these datasets and explain our motivation for incorporating them into our experiments. GTSRD The first dataset is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Database (GTSRD), which is a combination of the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) datasets. It was created by Stallkamp et al. [2] with the intention of providing a lifelike dataset of traffic signs for solving challenging computer vision and pattern recognition problems. It is a multi-class, single-image dataset, where each image contains one traffic sign. It comprises of over 40 classes of different street signs, as well as over 50k images and shows these signs in various lighting conditions. While the dataset is called “German Traffic Signs“, it should be pointed out that these road signs are subject to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals [3], which has been widely adopted in Europe and Russia and can therefore be used to solve traffic sign recognition problems in European and Russian street conditions.

84f4e70f040dccf5ad26ecc23339aa7c688b287c,Agrobiological characteristics of spelt wheat and intermediate wheatgrass in the Right-Bank Forest-Steppe of Ukraine,"Estimation of spelt wheat and the species of intermediate wheatgrass by the main agrobiological indicators (calendar dates of the beginning of the main phases of plant development, plant height dynamics, dry mass accumulation, grain yield and protein content) compared to soft wheat was done. The index of stability of grain yield formation was determined. It was found that the main phases of development in spelt wheat occurred on average 10–15 days later than in soft wheat. Plants of intermediate wheatgrass in the first year of cultivation had slower growth. The main phases of development in plants of intermediate wheatgrass of the second and third year of growth occurred almost in the same time with soft wheat. It was established that spelt wheat and intermediate wheatgrass were significantly superior to soft wheat in plant height. In the earing phase, the height of these plants was on average more than 100 cm, which had to be taken into account when growing these crops. It varied from 25 to 42 cm in spelt wheat and from 29 to 57 cm in intermediate wheatgrass during the stem elongation phase depending on the weather conditions of the research year. This indicator ranged from 107 to 113 cm and from 96 to 117 cm, respectively, in the earing phase, and from 137 to 168 cm and from 107 to 196 cm in the phase of milk ripeness of grain. Plants of spelt wheat and intermediate wheatgrass had a high stability index of the formation of dry matter and grain yield. It should be noted that intermediate wheatgrass formed a significant vegetative mass even in the earing phase. The vegetative mass in spelt wheat was formed during the earing period – full ripeness of grain. These crops (spelt wheat – 22.1 ± 0.4, intermediate wheatgrass – 22.4–24.6 ± 0.2–0.5) were significantly superior to soft wheat (12.1 ± 0.5) by the content of protein in grain, so it was recommended to involve them in the selection programs to create species with high productivity. However, spelt wheat (5.58 ± 0.13) was less and intermediate wheatgrass (0.98–1.22 ± 0.14–0.18) was the most inferior to soft wheat (8.03 ± 0.27) in terms of grain yield.

How have we Introduced distance Learning?,"espanolLa Republica de Croacia inicio en 2015 un proyecto piloto denominado e-Skole que incluia entre sus objetivos desarrollar un modelo de escuelas “digitalmente maduras”, de manera que las Tecnologias de la Informacion y la Comunicacion (TIC) ocuparan un lugar destacado en todas las etapas educativas, siendo incorporadas al curriculum y que tanto estudiantes como profesorado mejoraran sus competencias digitales. Dicho proyecto se materializo en el programa experimental de reforma curricular “Skola za život”, cuya implementacion esta prevista que culmine este mismo ano 2020. Dada la naturaleza de esta iniciativa innovadora que se encuentra, durante su desarrollo, con una crisis sanitaria provocada por la pandemia del COVID19, se convierte en estos momentos en una reforma especialmente significativa y oportuna. Sin embargo, el aula y los centros educativos, habitualmente testigos de cualquier transformacion, han sido sustituidos por un escenario completamente distinto: el hogar y el entorno familiar. En este nuevo contexto se deben aplicar actualmente muchos de los propositos que dieron lugar a la creacion de la reforma y la promovieron. Entre sus retos estaba desarrollar un cambio integral en la forma de impartir conocimientos y en su aprendizaje, centrado en las tecnologias. Actualmente los ordenadores y tabletas, junto a otros recursos tecnologicos, han sido los principales medios para su aplicacion. Ante esta realidad, el Ministerio de Ciencia y Educacion croata ha publicado diversos Informes en los que se ofrecen directrices, normas especificas y diversas pautas que deben seguir los docentes, directores de centro, familias y tambien los estudiantes para alcanzar un modelo comun de aprendizaje on-line eficaz. Tomando en consideracion ambas circunstancias, una reforma en curso y la necesidad de establecer un nuevo modelo de formacion virtual por circunstancias sobrevenidas, analizamos en este articulo los Informes gubernamentales publicados para facilitar este transito en los que se refleja el valor de los recursos tecnologicos, que identifican ampliamente su reforma curricular. EnglishThe Republic of Croatia initiated in 2015 a pilot project named e-School that included, among its aims, the development of a model of “digitally mature” schools, so that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have a relevant place at all educational levels and are incorporated into the curriculum with a view to improve the technological skills of both teachers and students alike. The implementation of this experimental project, which has been given the title of ‘School for Life’, is expected to be carried out this very year, 2020. Given the current situation that many education systems find themselves in as a result of the COVID19 pandemic, the project has proven to be a particularly timely and significant reform. However, classrooms and educational centres, that have normally been the witnesses of such transformations, have been replaced by a completely different scenario: i. e the home and family environment. It is in this new context in which many of the proposals the reform was created and promoted with must be applied today. Among its challenges was developing a comprehensive change in relation to teaching methods, with an increased emphasis to be placed on technological resources. Nowadays, computers and tablets, together with other technological resources, have become the primary means for its application. Facing this reality, the Croatian Ministry of Science and Education has published several reports in which they present guidelines, specific rules and diverse patterns that may be followed by teachers, headmasters, families and also students, in order to achieve an effective online learning model. Considering both circumstances, a running reform and the need of establishing a new virtual education model due to unexpected circumstances, we analyse in this article reports published by the Croatian government outlining the facilitation of this transition in which the value of the technological resources with regard to curricular reform has been shown.",,2020.0,6,"{'url': 'https://revistas.uned.es/index.php/REEC/article/download/27637/21668', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5944/reec.36.2020.27637?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5944/reec.36.2020.27637, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The Significance of The Study of Mudslide Animation Mudslide flow is a sudden natural disaster phenomenon, mostly in the valley deep in the mountains or hillside areas, has a strong destructive, each year in China's mountains caused huge casualties and property losses, its characteristics include the strong, fast, destructive, huge flow, the occurrence of short time and high frequency. The reasons for its composition are produced under the combined effect of geological structure, topography, human economy and meteorology, and usually contain huge solid rock blocks and high-concentration sediment mixtures, showing the flow of the viscous layer flow and the sparse layer flow mixture. The motion form of mudslide includes a mixture of landslides and water-based sediments, which is a state of special material fluid movement of complex mixtures. The characteristics of the high intensity of mudslide eruption struck from the accumulation of the amount during the formation process to reach a zero boundary point, and after the occurrence of periodic, mass hair and the same hairstyle and other characteristics, so in the short term, a large number of rock blocks, sediments and trees from the ground height from top to bottom, and the formation of a stacking area, Where it goes, it causes great damage to the human production environment, poses a great threat to the safety of human life and property, and causes great damage to the construction of human infrastructure. And in the rapid development of modern computer film and television animation technology today, we can through the mud flow disaster computer simulation animation reproduction to study it, let it in the form of animation simulation rendering, so that we can more intuitive and specific analysis of it, which is in society, campus, In particular, it is of great significance to carry out popular science education in mountainous areas prone to mudslide disasters. 2. Key Types of Causes of Mudslide Disasters Collapses and landslides are usually caused by the loss of stability of geological slope rock and soil, and the causes are often inextricably linked, which can be considered as a large category in the key types of mudslide animation. Based on the leading factors to subdivide it, it can be divided into blasting vibration-induced, permeable irrigation-induced type, reservoir immersion-induced type, engineering load-trigger type, cut slope discharge type, underground excavation-induced type, freeze-thaw osmosis-induced type, natural evolution-induced type, earthquake-induced type, rain-induced type. The composition of the mudslide is a complex special fluid formed by the mixture of loose rock and soil and liquid water and other debris, which is considered as another type in the key type of 2020 International Conference on Social and Human Sciences (ICSHS2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000187 ISBN: 978-1-80052-000-4 1027 mudslide animation, and the mudslide disaster can be initially divided into the type of landslide erosion, the ice lake dam collapse type, the tailings dam collapse type, the project abandoned collapse type, the landslide dam collapse type, the landslide dam collapse type, Slope liquefaction type, valley evolution type. Accumulation slide erosion type: natural or man-made landslides or loose geology due to sharp rainfall, slope surface due to infiltration of rain caused by liquefaction, the formation of plastic flow of slip or landslide, and then along the depression caused by landslides repeatedly washed erosion, resulting in the formation of ditch shaping and trench erosion type of mudslides. Ice Lake Dam Collapse Type: A special type of mudslide formed in the high-cold mountain area, the advance of the glacier, the ice tongue fracture, the collapse or landslide on the slope of the ice lake, the melting acceleration caused by the rise in temperature, the collapse caused by the lake mouth to the lower part of the ice dam caused the ice lake to collapse, resulting in millions or even hundreds of millions of cubic meters of water immediately tilted down, During the period will be wrapped in a large number of sediment and rocks, the formation of ferocious, huge flow, short time, strong destructive landslide disaster. Tailing dam collapse type: because the mixture of tailings, slag and water body gradually over time makes the tailings dam deformation penetration, collapse formation, tailings reservoir due to artificial supervision and maintenance loopholes, may breed mudslide disaster, but also pollution of land and water resources. Engineering abandoned collapse type: in the process of construction due to surface excavation or underground excavation of slag in the ditch unreasonable emission accumulation, hindering the surface runoff or flash flood channel, accompanied by heavy rainfall under the formation of temporary lake, the rapid rise of water level and permeation deformation of geological rock and soil rapid liquefaction, subsidence and break the embankment to form a mudslide. Landslide dam collapse type: a landslide caused by rainfall, earthquake or engineering activities, due to the gradual rise of water level, loose rock and soil penetration deformation or new factors lead to landslides or the formation of a dammed lake breakwater the embankment of the mudslide. Slope liquefaction type: Slope rock and soil caused by regional typhoon rain or continuous local heavy rain in mountainous and hilly areas due to rain erosion, rapid saturation of rock and soil, and suddenly flow downward. The evolution of the valley type: In the evolution of the geological environment of the natural valley, the phenomenon of the effect of saturation, erosion, transportation and accumulation of rock and soil accumulation, the mudslide slower of the valley can be divided into three parts, namely, the source area, the circulation area and the accumulation area. Its basic characteristics are large water area, long movement path and strong destructive ability, often accompanied by landslides, showing a certain periodicity. 3. The Core Principle of Mudslide Animation 3.1 Key Parameters of Mudslide Special Effects Technology The main object of mudslide is the mixture fluid, which contains a variety of elements, such as liquid, solid and hybrid, in the process of mudslide, the accompanying fluid phenomenon is pour, collapse, break the embankment, collision, parcel, etc., has the basic characteristics of variability and mobility. In the physical parameters of the fluid and the parameters of the model algorithm, the parameters of fluid physics mainly include the number of particles of the fluid, particle mass, particle radius, static density, gravity acceleration and viscosity coefficient of the fluid, the radius of the particles determines the degree of fluid thinning, the static density determines the fluid mass, gravity acceleration determines the motion speed of the fluid. The above is the basic unit of computer computing behind the software simulation in the simulation mudslide animation. The representative software for simulating mudslides, such as RealFlow, 3dsMax, Rayfire, etc., can virtually different types of fluids and different elements of fluid strapped to the fluid, which can",2020 International Conference on Social and Human Sciences (ICSHS2020),2020.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38007/proceedings.0000187?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38007/proceedings.0000187, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The proportion of under-five deaths in the newborn period was found to have increased from 41 per cent (in year 2000) to 46 percent [1]. Statistics indicate that 98% of the global one million deaths as a result of neonatal sepsis occur in Africa. Neonatal sepsis contributes to 28% of neonatal mortality in Kenya. Study objective: The study sought to identify maternal characteristics of mothers to neonates admitted for management of neonatal sepsis in Kenyatta National Hospital (K.N.H) pediatric wards. Methodology: This was a mixed-method study where both quantitative cross-sectional and qualitative approaches were used within K.N.H pediatric wards. A total of 107 study participants were enrolled in the study. The study subjects were selected by systematic random sampling method in which every alternate participant was selected Data was obtained from consenting mothers and healthcare workers. The researcher gathered data on maternal factors associated with the development of neonatal sepsis. Three focused group discussions comprising nurses, doctors and clinical officers were conducted. Data was collected by use of researcher administered semi-structured questionnaire. Qualitative data was audiotaped, transcribed and analyzed into themes. Data was cleaned, entered into computer and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Level of significance was at < 0.05.

2c7eeac21ad9f8a8e4bba266c87a636330024fb3,Development and Practice of New Mode of Music Education in Higher Vocational Colleges,"With the continuous progress of social development, investment in education in China is increasing year by year. In order to better meet the needs of modern society for multi-faceted talents, the multi-professional education in vocational colleges is constantly developing and upgrading. Especially for music education in vocational colleges, music education in modern vocational colleges is facing new development through a more suitable way of education and a deeper educational background. This paper discusses the development and practice of the new mode of music education in vocational colleges. Since the reform and opening up, economic level in China has been significantly improved, so other aspects of our country have made considerable progress, especially in the field of education. With the continuous development of society and the continuous improvement of people's cultural knowledge level, the state attaches more importance to education. In recent years, the investment in education industry is increasing. It is also because of the strong support of the state and society that modern education has gradually developed more specialties and more different educational resources. This paper discusses and studies the development of the new mode of music major in the modern higher education system and the effect in the practice process. 1. Problems Existing in the Reform of Music Education in Modern Vocational Colleges There are many problems in the teaching process of music in modern colleges and universities. For example, modern vocational colleges lack the resources to help students complete the course. Secondly, for the colleges and universities themselves, the construction of professional equipment and classrooms required for student learning is not in place, leading to problems in actual teaching effects. Therefore, in order to improve the teaching level of music majors in vocational colleges and ensure the good learning effect of students, it is necessary to reform the music teaching mode of the existing higher colleges. However, it encounters the following three problems during the reform process. First of all, the current teaching methods of music education are not clear, and the research on teaching models is not thorough. For the study of music majors, most of them are studied as a subject of interest. They do not pay much attention to the actual learning situation of students and the learning theories needed in the specific educational process are not carried out by either the educational compiler or the actual application. On the grounds that music is free, the teacher does not restrict the student's learning process. The student is free to indulge his college life on the grounds that music is free. The final learning effect is conceivable. Therefore, it is very important to clarify the teaching methods in order to reform the music teaching mode of modern higher colleges. At present, the educational textbooks and teaching modes used in the teaching of music majors in higher education colleges in China are too monolithic, so that students do not recognize this teaching model and cannot integrate into the teaching environment. In order to cater to the diversified needs of students, teachers simply adopt unsupervised stocking education for students' teaching methods to meet the diverse teaching needs of students. As a result of this education, the school can not really train a qualified music graduate, which is irresponsible to students and parents. In addition, there is a lack of practical teaching. The study of music majors relies heavily on practical teaching work. The lack of practical teaching leads to restrictions on students' 2020 International Conference on Educational Science (ICES2020) DOI: 10.38007/Proceedings.0000406 ISBN: 978-1-80052-001-1 894 understanding of music and the degree of learning about music. Moreover, for the music major, most of them need students to learn one to several different instruments. In order to better improve the professional level of students, a large amount of practical teaching is very necessary. 2. Development and Practice of Music Education Mode in Modern Vocational Colleges The new mode of music education in modern colleges and universities refers to the innovative training mode of music talents, that is, to improve students' aesthetic ability and professional ability to lay a solid foundation for students' lifelong learning of music and achieve the goal of improving students' quality in an all-round way. For example, in the music education of modern colleges and universities, a certain number of class hours will be set up as music appreciation courses to cultivate students' artistic accomplishment. In order to better improve teachers' teaching level and students' learning effect in class, teachers can innovatively adopt a new teaching mode combining art with popularity. While introducing the basic music knowledge of music appreciation, they can select some classical music and similar music from modern music for appreciation. Then it can improve students' music accumulation and their understanding of music. In order to better complete the reform of the new mode of music education in modern colleges and universities, the original teaching mode should be reformed from many aspects. First of all, classroom teaching methods should be taught by a more colorful classroom teaching method. For example, in the process of classroom teaching, students can be divided into several different groups with discussion-based teaching, and students with the same interest can be put into different groups, such as classical music group and modern music group. In the classroom, different groups have different opinions on the questions raised by teachers, which leads to different opinions and discussion. In the process of discussion, teachers do not need to join in, but they can explain the final answers by themselves, to improve students' participation in the classroom and deepen their learning knowledge comprehension in class. Secondly, schools can set up special music network resources platform. Modern network resources are developed, and most of the music network resources can be found on the network. However, for some classical music clips and music videos, it is very difficult to find on the network, or the resources found are very vague. Schools usually have resources that students can't find, so they can set up a special music resources sharing platform, which can publish some classical music or video clips of teachers in class and music history for students to learn. Such a teaching method can not only promote the enthusiasm of students to learn music, but also greatly improve the teaching quality of music education in modern vocational colleges. Third, school can give play to the educational role of campus culture for students. In the process of modern music education, there are many different ways of education to meet the diverse teaching needs of students. In particular, computers and mobile phones have not only accelerated the connection between people, but also broadened the promotion methods and activities of campus culture. For example, in order to train the students' music level, the school can open corresponding music channels, and the relevant teachers can improve certain technical guidance. As the main builder of the music channel, the students can still apply the knowledge of the profession in daily life and improve the professionalism of students. In addition, for the evenings and chorus competitions established by the school, the school can pull the music majors as contestants and even judges of the competitions. Even the school can set up special concerts for the music majors to train the students' stage performance ability and professional application ability. Finally, it is possible to strengthen the education of students through several enterprises that cooperate with the school and promote the all-round development of students. In recent years, many companies in China have set up various scholarships in schools, especially in higher education institutions to give back to the society. They provide many opportunities for music students and the stage for students to perform. In addition, in order to further promote the development of the school, enterprises often purchase a lot of instruments for the students to learn and use. The school should also arrange these instruments reasonably, and provide students with better music surroundings through the construction of related music classrooms.",International Conference on Evolvable Systems,2020.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38007/proceedings.0000406?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38007/proceedings.0000406, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Coronal and axial boundaries for femoral component placement to achieve balance however, are not well defined. Our aim is to investigate the effect of femoral component and long leg coronal and axial alignment on patient outcomes when using a tibia-first gap balancing technique. All surgeries were performed using the OMNIBotics robot-assisted TKA platform and BalanceBot device. A total of 197 patients were prospectively enrolled into this study and received TKA surgery using the OMNIBotics platform and completed 1-year KOOS outcome scores. Femoral component and tibiofemoral alignment were categorized as inliers or outliers in the coronal and axial planes. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and University of California at Los Angeles Activity Scale (UCLA) was collected at 1-year post-op. No significant differences were found between the KOOS subscores or UCLA outcome and femoral coronal or tibiofemoral coronal and axial alignment. Significant differences were found between the KOOS pain and sports sub-scores and femoral axial alignment (∆ = 5.4, p = 0.007, ∆ = 8.3, p = 0.03 respectively), in which outlier femoral rotation reported higher scores. Component alignment limits for improved survival and patient outcomes are a source of ongoing debate.

3155d1a31ea3f954deee732baf388ab6afcf3042,Agrobiological characteristics of spelt wheat and intermediate wheatgrass under the conditions of the Right-Bank Forest-Steppe of Ukraine,"Estimation of spelt wheat and the species of intermediate wheatgrass by the main agrobiological indicators (calendar dates of the beginning of the main phases of plant development, plant height dynamics, dry mass accumulation, grain yield and protein content) compared to soft wheat was done. The index of stability of grain yield formation was determined. It was found that the main phases of development in spelt wheat occurred on average 10–15 days later than in soft wheat. Plants of intermediate wheatgrass in the first year of cultivation had slower growth. The main phases of development in plants of intermediate wheatgrass of the second and third year of growth occurred almost in the same time with soft wheat. It was established that spelt wheat and intermediate wheatgrass were significantly superior to soft wheat in plant height. In the earing phase, the height of these plants was on average more than 100 cm, which had to be taken into account when growing these crops. It varied from 25 to 42 cm in spelt wheat and from 29 to 57 cm in intermediate wheatgrass during the stem elongation phase depending on the weather conditions of the research year. This indicator ranged from 107 to 113 cm and from 96 to 117 cm, respectively, in the earing phase, and from 137 to 168 cm and from 107 to 196 cm in the phase of milk ripeness of grain. Plants of spelt wheat and intermediate wheatgrass had a high stability index of the formation of dry matter and grain yield. It should be noted that intermediate wheatgrass formed a significant vegetative mass even in the earing phase. The vegetative mass in spelt wheat was formed during the earing period – full ripeness of grain. These crops (spelt wheat – 22.1 ± 0.4, intermediate wheatgrass – 22.4–24.6 ± 0.2–0.5) were significantly superior to soft wheat (12.1 ± 0.5) by the content of protein in grain, so it was recommended to involve them in the selection programs to create species with high productivity. However, spelt wheat (5.58 ± 0.13) was less and intermediate wheatgrass (0.98–1.22 ± 0.14–0.18) was the most inferior to soft wheat (8.03 ± 0.27) in terms of grain yield.

c2fee8b750b7d942208022325af84add6335496f,Intra-Operative Soft Tissue Targets For Improved Outcomes In Total Knee Arthroplasty,"A poorly balanced, unstable or stiff joint is a leading cause of dissatisfaction and revision after surgery. The quantitative definition of a well-balanced joint, however, remains a source of controversy. This study investigates joint gaps measured by a digitally-controlled ligament tensioning device throughout flexion and its effect on postoperative outcome. Surgeries were performed using the OMNIBotics robot-assisted TKA platform and BalanceBot device. Joint gaps were recorded by the BalanceBot throughout flexion during trialing. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was collected at 1-year post-op. Correlations between joint gaps and KOOS outcome were investigated. Knees that reported: a medial gap ≤ lateral gap in extension (p = 0.007, median ∆ = 8.3); an average joint gap of between 1 mm tighter and 1 mm looser than the final insert thickness in midflexion (p = 0.006, median ∆ = 5.5); and an imbalance of less than 1.5 mm in flexion (p = 0.012, median ∆ = 2.8) reported significantly improved pain scores. Patients which satisfied both extension and flexion criteria, or midflexion and flexion criteria reported improved outcomes compared to those which satisfied only one or neither criterion (p = 0.0002, median ∆ = 9.7, p = 0.0019, median ∆ = 8.4 respectively). KOOS Pain scores correlated with joint gap measurements across all flexion angles investigated. Combining joint gap windows, subgroups of patients were found that reported a change in the median KOOS Pain outcome beyond the minimally clinically important difference.

The introduction of the policy was aimed at realizing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Education for All (EFA) objectives before the year 2015. FPE was mooted with the idea of promoting equity and access to education by all children despite their economic background, gender, geographical location among other factors but its effect in promoting equity has been the subject for inquiry by many scholars although no study has been undertaken to look at the contribution of FPE on promotion of equity in primary in Marakwet Sub County, Elgeyo–Marakwet County, Kenya. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of free instructional resources provision on Equity in access to education in primary schools in Marakwet Sub County, Elgeyo-Marakwet County, Kenya. The study was guided by Rawls Theory of Justice. The study was conducted in primary schools in Marakwet Sub County involving 99 schools. The study used cross-sectional survey research design technique. The target population comprised of head teachers, Sub County Education Officer (DEO), Parents Teachers Representatives (PTA) and teachers of selected schools within the Sub County. The sample size comprised of 30 head teachers, 30 PTA officials, 1 DEO and 197 teachers. Purposive and systematic sampling techniques were used in selecting respondents. Questionnaires, interview schedules and document checklists were instruments for data collection. Instruments were tested for validity and reliability before field data collection. Data collected was analyzed using descriptive (frequencies, percentages, means and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (Multiple linear Regression) with the aid of SPSS (Version 20.0) computer programme. The findings were presented using tables, pie charts and graphs. MLR result showed that 12.3% of the Equity in access to education in primary schools was accounted by availing of instructional resources. The study recommends that there be an increase in vote heads for tuition support, infrastructure and teacher recruitment to ensure equity in education access in primary schools in the study area.

df80ec98e89e3293ae92c13ffd4a9c396a76e473,Growth and minituber yield response of potato plantlets in micropropagation to different plant spacing under greenhouse conditions,"e-ISSN : 2618-5946 DOI: 10.31015/jaefs.2020.3.5 Introduction Vegetables are rich and comparatively cheaper source of vitamins. Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is one of them. It is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial night shade family Solanaceae. Potato plays an important role to mitigate the food and nutritional requirements of the fast growing population of developing countries of the world. The balance of protein to calories and the composition of minerals make potato second only to eggs in nutritional value as a single source (Swaminatha and Sawyer, 1983). Among the root and tuber crops, it ranks first followed by cassava, sweet potatoes and yams (Hawkes, 1990; FAO, 2008). There are a number of constraints that negatively affect potato production in the world and these include lack of quality seed potato, declining soil fertility and structure due to poor management practice, diseases etc (Demo et al., 2007, 2009). In Pakistan, it is also an important vegetable with an area and production of 177.3 thousands hectares and 3977.6 thousand tons, respectively during 2015-16 (GOP 2016). Although potato production in Pakistan has increased many folds but it’s per acre yield is far less than in other parts of the world (Malik, 1995). Among the various factors responsible for low per acre potato production, potato diseases are considered to be the most important. More than 18 potato diseases are reported in Pakistan, of which 13 are of common occurrence. Their importance, however, varies considerably in different potato growing areas (Ahmad et al., 1991). Tissue culture helps in the production of disease free potato because shortage of good quality seed has been recognized as the single most important factor limiting potato production in the developing countries. Production of quality planting material is essential not only for improving domestic potato productivity but also to ensure commercial quality as required under Cite this article as: Gul, Z., Qureshi, F., Jamal, Z.

Plant tissue culture is widely used to produce clones of a plant through micro propagation. In vitro micro propagation is an alternative to conventional propagation of potatoes (Chandra and Birhman, 1994). In vitro propagation methods using meristem tips, nodal cuttings and micro tubers are more reliable for maintaining genetic integrity of the multiplied clones. In vitro produced disease free potato clones combined with conventional multiplication methods have become an integral part of seed production in many countries (Naik and Sarkar, 2000). Mini tubers can be produced throughout the year and are principally used for the production of pre-basic or basic seed by direct field planting (Lommen, 1999, Ritter et al., 2001). Appropriate plant density is a key for gainful production of potato in various environments. The possibility of securing high yield depends much upon maintenance of optimum number of plants per unit area and their spatial arrangement in the field. Many studies have been conducted to establish the optimal combination of planting distance for a certain environment not only for potato but many other plants as well (Zerga et al 2017,Idoko et al 2017, Sultana and Shahiduzzaman 2016, Mahmood et al, 2015) etc. It is well known that plant density (inter and intra-row spacing) is very important aspect of potato production since it significantly affects number of tubers per plant, tuber weight, tuber yield and size (Arega et al, 2018). According to Hani et al., (2018) increase in plant density decreases the mean tuber size due to increased inter plant competition for light, water and nutrients. However, the optimal planting density differs depending on the environmental conditions and cultivars. According to Gulluoglu and Arioglu (2009) closer spacing reduced tuber number per hill, average tuber weight, tuber yield per hill. Since, quality of potato seed is a key factor in profitable potato production, it is imperative to identify appropriate spacing for seed potato productions. Previous studies were conducted in the field or uncontrolled environment and no work has been done so far on adequate plant spacing for tissue cultured plantlets transplantation in green house to obtain maximum mini-tubers production. The present study was conducted to optimize a protocol for best inter and intra row spacing for tissue cultured potato plantlets transplantation on greenhouse tables in order to get maximum mini tubers yield and size. Materials and Methods The present research work was performed at tissue culture laboratory and greenhouse, Hazara Agriculture Research Station, Abbottabad in 2018. Five liters of MS media (Murashige and Skoog media 1962) was prepared from the stock solutions (Table 1) of macro and micro salts with 1 mgl-1Ca-pentothenate, 100mgl-1 Myoinositol and 30gl-1 sucrose. The pH was adjusted to 5.8 with either 0.1N HCl or 0.1N NaOH. The media was poured in to the test tubes @ 10ml per test tube and were autoclaved at 121°C at 15 psi for 15 minutes. About 30 days old disease free plants of potato cultivar Desiree were selected from the Tissue culture laboratory as explants (fig. 1). The explants were cut in to nodal segments and inoculated into test tubes. These cultured test tubes were incubated into growth chamber for 30 days at 18°C under photoperiod of 16h light and 8 hours dark (Fig. 1). After 30 days the plantlets were transplanted in peat moss soil on greenhouse tables. There were nine different combinations of inter and intra row spacing. Plants of S1 having distance of row-row 30cm x plant-plant 15cm, S2(30cm x10cm), S3 (10cm x15cm), S4 (20cm x5cm) , S5(30cm x5cm) , S6(10cm x5cm), S7(20cm x15cm) , S8(10cm x10cm) and S9 having distance of (20cm x10cm) respectively. The data on growth parameters were recorded for the each spacing after every 20 days. The study parameters were shoot length, number of leaves, inter nodal distance, number of nodes, number of branches, number of leaves per branch, tuber weight, tuber diameter, number of eyes and average tuber yield per plant. The experiment was conducted using completely randomized design (CRD). The data were analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Least Significance Difference test was used for significance of results at 95% level of confidence. All the statistical analysis were done using computer software Statistix 8.1. Figure 1. Plantlets of potato variety Desiree are ready to be transplanted in peat moss on the greenhouse tables. Zishan Gul, Faizan Qureshi and Zafar Jamal Int J Agric Environ Food Sci 4(3):271-277 (2020) 273 Results Each treatment showed different results regarding vegetative growth parameters at different spacing. Shoot length The data regarding shoot length in all nine inter and intra row spacing combinations were differed significantly (P≤0.05) after 10 days of transplantation (Table 1). The plants of spacing treatments 20 x 5 cm and 30 x 5 cm showed higher shoot length (9.26 cm) and (9.27 cm), respectively, whereas the spacing 20 x 10 cm showed significantly minimum shoot length i.e 6.77",,2020.0,2,"{'url': 'https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/810313', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31015/jaefs.2020.3.5?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31015/jaefs.2020.3.5, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a494474f2b25cadcfdff9159149970bf8f337a19,Monitoring Air Pollution Impacts of COVID-19 in India,"Objective: Air quality is an important issue that is affecting human health, flora, fauna, and ecosystems. Vehicular pollution, demolition, construction, and population burst are the main reasons for degrading air quality. Hence, the main aim of the study is to monitor, analyse, as well as predict the air pollution component i.e., particulate matter before and after the lockdown of COVID-19 in various Indian cities of India. Methods: The data collected is from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India from 2015-2020 for the pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10. Pre-Processing techniques such as removal of null values using MICE imputer on multivariate data, merging the columns, and minmax feature scaling is applied. The cities are classified and further subdivided based on Terrain (coastal, mountainous and plains) and based on Population (highly populated and less populated). The study predicts the values for Particulate matter by using the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model using optimal hyperparameters for better prediction. Results: The presented system for Air Quality Index (AQI) values includes 2020 data, and the forecasted results were highly optimistic. Further, this scenario is pure since 2020 is an outlier. A better prediction may be possible by skipping 2020. The performance of the forecasting model is calculated by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) error which may help control the degraded air quality. The predicted AQI values for the year 2021 are predicted through SARIMA and produced 18.301 RMSE value for Lucknow and 46.198 for Delhi.

Email: deborah.lawlerdormer@maas.museum Auckland Face Simulator and Witness are two transdisciplinary projects collaboratively developed with Associate Professor Dr Mark Sagar at the Laboratory for Animate Technologies, Auckland Bioengineering Institute at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Corballis has utilized the digital agent modelling constructed by Dr Mark Sagar in a cognitive neuropsychological research project entitled the Auckland Face Simulator (AFS) project. AFS is an investigation led by Corballis and his team at the School of Psychology at the University of Auckland to explore neurophysiological and neuropsychological research into emotion, digital agency and empathy. Corballis has recently set up a neurophysiology lab for research incorporating psychophysical, electrophysiological, neuroimaging and neuropsychological aspects. AFS uses digital agents that portray adult faces depicting differing age, gender and race that have been realistically and precisely modelled to show accurate expression. These digital agents model Ekman and Friesen’s FACS system for neuropsychological research that can be further developed for face perception research in a variety of psychology research pathways. Central to this applied research is how much agency and animacy is contained within subjects’ interaction with the digital agent models and to establish if emotional engagement with simulated models replicates ‘real’ emotional engagement. One of the digital agents in the AFS project was modelled on Lawler-Dormer’s features and emotional register for use both as an artistic project and for Corballis’ research. This digital agent, named LEAH, enabled Lawler-Dormer to frame the project as a technoscientific art case study whilst continuing to participate as a human and digital subject for neuropsychological research. Her contribution to this paper will address the practical and theoretical considerations underlying the project, showing complex posthuman and bioethical relations. LEAH, is exhibited as an intra-active screen-based installation called Witness. The creation of Witness was an iterative transdisciplinary collaborative process, involving artists, engineers, computer scientists, sound composers and neuroscientists. This artwork engages with a deep questioning of the posthuman through bioengineering self-imaging practices and reflects on our co-evolution with technology.

Email: jcat@unimelb.edu.au Art and biomedical research, driven by abstract creativity and concrete reduction-to-practice, are strikingly synergistic and collaboration is widely pursued in leading Tertiary institutions but difficult to implement. This paper describes the seldom recorded institutional dynamics of developing an art-science collaboration between the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) and the Faculty of Medicine (MDHS) both within the University of Melbourne, a leading tertiary institution. Phase 1. Scoping the problem. Leaders at VCA and MDHS met in early 2017 and identified three key barriers: (i) physical separation of campuses (6km between SouthBank Arts and Parkville Biomedical precincts), (ii) siloed ‘micro-cultures’ (VCA, with a 150 year history independence, has only recently been incorporated into UoM), and (iii) lack of cross-disciplinary bridging events. The strategy of developing a public-facing bridging event was prioritized. Phase 2. “Beta” program. While exploring collaborative themes the metaphor of ‘the Storm’ resonated with artists and scientists. In late 2016 a rare meteorological anomaly precipitated the catastrophic “Melbourne Storm Asthma crisis” which killed 9 people and affected 9000+ more. Taking STORM as a metaphor, an initial “beta” public discussion forum to increase awareness of Storm Asthma was held in 2017, where prominent artists and leading medical researchers exchanged views.","Leonardo: Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology",2020.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1162/LEON_A_01976?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1162/LEON_A_01976, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The younger individuals, though the persistent neck pain is very rare, yet there is a need to identify those factors that lead to its chronicity, so that it can be prevented. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out on 390 healthy students belonging to the medical and paramedical undergraduate courses of two different medical colleges in a smart city. Study was carried over a period of 5 years from the period of December 2014 to December 2019. The study included all the students who consented to the study and where willing to participate in that. All the students were given a questionnaire at the beginning of the study and data was collected at the end of 4 months, 8 months and 12 months. In those patients where diagnosis having persistent neck pain, where were completely evaluated in order to find out the possible risk factors that can be associated with the persistence of neck pain. Results and Observations : In the study we recruited 300 students from two medical colleges in the city of Mangalore Dakshina Kannada, smart City e in South India. In these students 200 where students from medical College 50 students from the physiotherapy College and another 50 students from allied sciences that included radiography and laboratory technicians. It was observed that. At the end of 1 year following recruitment, 61% of the individuals had complaints of neck pain. Of which on follow up 21% has persistent neck pain. Of the 61% that is 183 cases who complained of neck pain at 1 year only 120 cases, that is 40% at persistence in the end of second year. Among these 120 cases, 99 cases had use of computer for more than 12 hours a day or the use of mobile phones specially while sleeping at night for more than 4-5 hours for a day. Of those who are using the computer they further analysed for the position of the screen and the mouse, 81 of the 99 cases reported that they used it as suitable to them, without the proper ergonomics. It was noted that the most severe pain was in the second year following which they did adjustments in the posture which reduce the severity of pain. Also so said that pain use to appear after working on the computer for more than 2 hours in those who had computer related neck pain comma and if the mobile phone was used in the sleeping posture for more than an hour it lead to neck pain. We also noted that the use of computer for entertainment purposes had a higher incidence than those who used for educational purposes. Those who used a screen time on mobile phone more during the night time had a higher incidence of neck pain than those who used most screen time during the day time Conclusion : In the study we concluded that the incidence of neck pain is higher among undergraduate students especially during the initial years of the course full stop the use of assisted learning modalities like computers and mobile phones have increased the incidence of neck pain among young. Though there is still and uncertainty about the factors that can cause neck pain in young and cannot be pointed out with accurate precision, it is what vi to considered to reduce the using of additional assisted modalities for both entertainment and education so that the morbidity that is associated with neck pain is reduced especially on the long-term 50 Nambiar et al. / IP Indian Journal of Anatomy and Surgery of Head, Neck and Brain 2020;6(2):49–52 1. Background and objective of the study Cervicalgia is one of the unseen common disorders that affects young adults at least during some point in their lifetime.1 The incidence of cervicalgia is said to be approximately ranging between 14% and 71% during a lifetime.2 The prevalence of persistent neck pain lasting for at least a year is as high as 75%. It is a very sad fact that those patients who develop neck pain progress into a chronic form which occurs in at least one third of those individuals who are affected by neck pain.3,4 It is noteworthy that this disease has a very high morbidity that it can be as a result of the disturbances in the quality of life and impairment it causes during work as a result of the discomfort it causes.5–7 Another important unseen effect of cervicalgia is that it reduces the overall productivity increases the amount of sick leaves, increases the cost of medical expenses, and has a higher chance of chronic disability especially for work. If all this is converted into to a monetary value, as stated two different studies that was done by Bernard and co-workers stated that the cost as a result of neck pain can be as 1.2 billion euros.5,6 Though there are various studies that have evaluated musculoskeletal disorders and their relationship with computer use the specific relationship and relation to neck pain has not been evaluated. Also persistent neck pain is a less commonly studied entity. In view of all the above said we decided to study the relationship between risk factors for cervicalgia incidence in medical undergraduate children. 2.

12fa429b44b53b5f164902a6e990a43e3b7cb5a5,Engaging High School Students in a University-Led Summer Anatomy Camp to Promote STEM Majors and Careers,"University-led K-12 outreach programs are designed to expose students to a variety of fields and career choices, but the benefits and outcomes of these have not been well documented. Existing programs often range from short presentations to more extensive residential summer programs. Nationally, there are only a few university-led high school human anatomy camps, with no current publications focusing on a formal evaluation of their goals. Described herein is a week-long human anatomy summer camp at Colorado State University (CSU) designed to inspire high school students to attend college and attract them to STEM majors and careers. The camp schedule includes lectures presented by CSU’s faculty, hands-on activities including learn from human cadavers and animal organs, as well as mentorship opportunities. Success of the program is measured by qualitative feedback and a follow-up survey to measure if the goals of the camp were well received. The data shows that all 28 of the senior high school students who attended camp have applied to college and are considering a STEM career after college. Camp counselors have reported continued mentor/mentee relationships with the students after camp. INTRODUCTION Many public and charter schools lack formal hands-on science laboratories which could be largely be attributed to the decrease in funding for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) programs (Gonzales, 2012; Executive Office of the President, 2010). Additionally, there is an increased curricular focus on standardized testing, which ultimately decreases students’ opportunities to explore all aspects of STEM, including exposure to college majors and career choices (Strauss, 2012; Hammack et al., 2015). In a recent study, high school and college students expressed that the most important factor influencing their career choice is the information provided by teachers, school counselors, and their parents (Hall et al., 2011). Information regarding STEM college majors and career choices is limited to the knowledge of faculty and staff, and by the funding and resources available to each school. In order to increase college enrollments in STEM majors, extracurricular outreach activities are needed to give students access to more information regarding their choices in college and beyond. Universities are in a unique position to facilitate this endeavor by widening students’ interest in STEM through valuable experiences on a college campus where resources and expertise are abundant. Following is a description of reported summer camps focusing on engaging and recruiting high school students into STEM. At the University of Rhode Island Kingston campus, Levine and colleagues created a weeklong chemistry camp for middle school students filled with hands-on experiments, field trips, and interaction with female scientists (2015). One key goal of camp was to encourage the girls’ interest in STEM disciplines and STEM careers. Survey results showed success in changing attitudes towards applicability of science and interest in pursuing a STEM-related career. Similarly, Adventures in Chemistry Camp is a week-long University-Led Summer Anatomy Camp Heise Vol. 3, Issue 1, December 2020 Journal of STEM Outreach 2 program during which students lived in college residence halls at the University of Nebraska Kearney and participated in daily hands-on chemistry experiments (Exstrom et al., 2000). The intent was to facilitate their first college experience. The small faculty-to-student ratio and the open-ended laboratory projects conducted in a research setting were important components of this camp compared to other chemistry camps currently offered. Results indicated that overall, the camp was well perceived by the students. In their exit survey, students indicated that they enjoyed staying in the dorms and conducting research with their advisor. To increase interest and knowledge about STEM, Hammack and colleagues (2015) measured the effects of a weeklong engineering summer camp on middle school students. School teachers and one engineering professor from a local university facilitated the camp at their school and measured how participating in a weeklong engineering summer camp affected middle school students’ attitudes towards engineering. Findings indicated that the students improved their understanding of technology and attitudes towards engineering. Likewise, Yilmaz and colleagues (2010) created a camp called YESTexas (Young Engineers of South Texas) with the goal to expose high school students to STEM concepts through a set of hands-on engineering projects. Results demonstrated that 24 out of 30 (80%) of the high school students had an increased interest in engineering disciplines after attending camp. Overall, the camp provided an opportunity to promote critical thinking, teamwork, writing, and leadership skills. “Girls on the Go: The Mobile Computing College Experience” is a summer camp designed for high school girls (Burge et al., 2013). This camp was created to encourage the students to attend college and to interest them in computer science as a possible career option. This camp was free of charge, held at Miami University in Florida, and focused on technical, informational, and social activities to give the students an idea of a balanced college experience. A comparison of preand post-surveys on 28 students suggested that the girls’ confidence in computer science and their understanding of careers in computer science increased. Furthermore, ten out of 25 students volunteered to continue working on the design for a computer application started during camp. In addition to laying a foundation of STEM knowledge and experience, residential camps create mentorship opportunities. University mentors provide more information about college majors, share their college experiences, and offer encouragement (Castleman, 2014). Mentors have an opportunity to shift student perception of social norms regarding choices regarding college majors and activities. It is not uncommon for first-year college students to struggle with a sense of belonging, which could be addressed by having mentors present on campus before or during their Freshman year (Walton and Cohen, 2011; Stephens et al., 2014). In 2014, Castleman created a peer-mentor intervention through which college students and advisors conducted outreach to support high school graduates in their college transition. Text and/or peer mentor interactions composed of in-person meetings and follow-up phone conversations took place in urban school districts in Boston, Lawrence, and Springfield (MA), Dallas (TX), and Philadelphia (PA). College enrollment varied across study sites ranging from 14 to 53% (Castleman, 2014). Castleman proposed that this method provided a “low-cost behavioral nudge” helping students reduce the complexity associated with navigating college and financial aid information. It also increased parents’ awareness of required pre-matriculation tasks. However, these interventions were only designed to help with applying to college and did not include continuous mentorship. To date, only a few university-led summer high school camps focusing on human anatomy have been documented, such as the Clinical Anatomy Summer Program at Stanford (Stanford Medicine, n.d.), the One-Week Summer Medicine Program at Boston Leadership Institute (Boston Leadership Institute, n.d.), and the Anatomy & Physiology Camp at the Appalachian State University Beaver College of Health Sciences (Appalachian State University, 2020). All of the aforementioned programs focus on using hands-on anatomy exercises to expose students to a variety of career options. However, there is a lack of a detailed evaluation of the goals and outcomes of these camps. The field would benefit from more research on how to successfully implement and assess the impact of these outreach endeavors. To simultaneously address the issues of exposing students to a variety of career options within STEM, especially the medical field, facilitate their first college experience, and create a long-term mentorship program, we developed a week-long human anatomy camp for high school students at Colorado State University. METHODS The main goals of the camp were to (1) expose high school students to various activities involving anatomy and introduce them to a variety of STEM major and career options, especially within the medical field, (2) facilitate their first college experience and (3) enable mentorships. Reported herein is the development, implementation, and evaluation of this summer anatomy camp, as well as implications for future outreach efforts (Figure 1). Camp Application and Student Cohort. Colorado State University’s annual Anatomy Camp was launched in summer of 2016 and takes place at the Fort Collins campus. High school students are accepted to camp based on several factors including year in school, interest in science, leadership potential, and written essay responses. Students need to have completed two years of high school to be eligible University-Led Summer Anatomy Camp Heise Vol. 3, Issue 1, December 2020 Journal of STEM Outreach 3 to apply. Applications are accepted until camp is full; once camp is full, applications are accepted for the waitlist. Tuition for anatomy camp is $1,850 per student and includes six nights of lodging in a residence hall, meals, a laboratory manual written by CSU’s Biomedical Sciences faculty, supplies, extracurricular camp activities, and a set of scrubs. Three scholarships are available to campers seeking financial support: The diversity scholarship aims to recognize and support students with diverse cultural, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds. The overcoming adversity scholarship provides support for students that have demonstrated strength in the face of adversity. Finally, the leadership award recognizes incoming campers that display leadership qualities and is funded by donations fro",,2020.0,6,"{'url': 'https://www.jstemoutreach.org/article/18374.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15695/jstem/v3i1.15?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15695/jstem/v3i1.15, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2cafaf85cd4b9f7e4583cfe326aab1dc1f61a5fa,Creating Virtual Spaces to Build Community Among Students Entering an Undergraduate Biomedical Engineering Program,"Undergraduate biomedical engineering (BME) programs challenge students with rigorous and multidisciplinary curricula that integrate concepts from the life sciences, mathematics, and engineering. Furthermore, BME curricula often incorporate active and team-based learning methodologies, in addition to more traditional engineering problem solving. To succeed in such broad and challenging programs, students may depend on interactions with their peers, both in and out of the classroom. We have observed that the shared challenge of an undergraduate BME curriculum creates a strong sense of community among each cohort of students, and we fear that students who enter our program during the COVID-19 pandemic may miss out on the formative experiences that begin to build such a community. Among the downsides of remote and blended learning models is the lack of face-to-face interactions that contribute to a sense of community among students. Such models may introduce risks for students, as psychological sense of community has been linked to perceived cognitive learning, persistence in degree programs, course satisfaction, and knowledge-sharing behavior. Many studies have reported efforts to enhance student engagement and sense of community in online and hybrid courses. Greater sense of community has been linked to increases in computer-mediated communication among students, instructor use of multimodal interactive learning environments and online social events, and instructor-moderated discussion boards and synchronous communication between students. In one survey focused on key strategies for building community in online courses, students ranked first the modeling of communitybuilding behaviors by the course instructor. At our large Midwestern public university, undergraduate engineering students must complete a mostly general first-year curriculum (i.e., introductory engineering, programming, mathematics, and science courses) before entering programs associated with individual engineering disciplines. Consequently, students in our undergraduate BME program are interspersed with students from varied STEM fields in their first-year courses before joining a roughly 40-student cohort that will take more than 15 BME courses together. Given the relatively small sizes of our student cohorts and the number of required courses, our students tend to form rich social connections with their classmates. In the first semester of our program, students must enroll in three courses: Introductory Biomechanics, Biomechanics Lab, and Introduction to Engineering Technical Reports (Fig. 1). Introductory Biomechanics is a lectureand problem solving-based course that covers statics and mechanics of materials; Biomechanics Lab is a laboratory course that entails the application of mechanical principles to biological and synthetic materials; and Introduction to Engineering Technical Reports is a technical communication course organized around the writing of lab reports. After the transition to online instruction in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, students in our program lamented the loss of connection to their peers, more so Address correspondence to Steven Higbee, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, USA.

301fcec06facc66c82d13581a42e4598d1c25de6,[The Breast Cancer Cohort Study in Chinese Women: research design and preliminary results of clinical multi-center cohort].,"Objective: The incidence of breast cancer in Chinese women continues to rise. The large breast cancer cohort studies in China are relatively scarce. There are many bottlenecks in the construction of large clinical cohort for breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognoses, such as inconsistent standards, high rates of lost follow-up, repeated construction, and inability to share. To better solving the difficulties and problems faced by large-scale clinical cohort research in China, this project will cooperate with several tertiary A hospitals to establish a breast cancer cohort in Chinese women. It also provides a data platform and technical support for breast cancer multi-center clinical cohort research. Methods: Based on the evidence-based medicine and expert opinion and consensus, we established a breast cancer cohort standardized indicator set-recording baseline information, diagnosis and treatment-related information of the enrolled patients, and collecting biological specimens. According to the technical specification of long-term follow-up for the endpoint, data management, and data security and in the large population-based cohort study, a standardized follow-up system for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of breast cancer prospective cohorts is formed. Results: Based on standardized data sets and the computer discipline's advantage from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, we integrate the new information technology methods, including dynamic information collection terminals and social networks. Thus, the quality of control programs on compliance and intelligence data was improved, and a Chinese women breast cancer cohort database was developed. By February 2020, 12 147 patients were included in the clinical cohort database. Biological specimens'resources in cohort construction were collected and cooperated with Shandong University to research the multi-center quality control system and shared evaluation system of biobanks. Building an open and shared biobank network and forming a full chain of breast cancer research platform. Conclusion: With the implementation of the ""13(th) Five-Year Plan"" precision medicine research, this study provides a research foundation for precision diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and provides data support for the country to formulate relevant medical policies.",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,2020.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200507-00694?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200507-00694, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f5fad61de66fbff57c744f1bd9111c0112200061,Organizational Bulk Email Systems: Their Role and Performance in Remote Work,"ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many employees to work from home. Organizational bulk emails now play a critical role to reach employees with central information in this work-from-home environment. However, we know from our own recent work that organizational bulk email has problems: recipients fail to retain the bulk messages they received from the organization; recipients and senders have different opinions on which bulk messages were important; and communicators lack technology support to better target and design messages. In this position paper, first we review the prior work on evaluating, designing, and prototyping organizational communication systems. Second we review our recent findings and some research techniques we found useful in studying organizational communication. Last we propose a research agenda to study organizational communications in remote work environment and suggest some key questions and potential study directions.

0b4229d093f190733323d99933d21a07eecef53c,Artificial Intelligence Research Community and Associations in Poland,"In last years Artificial Intelligence presented a tremendous progress by offering a variety of novel methods, tools and their spectacular applications. Besides showing scientific breakthroughs it attracted interest both of the general public and industry. It also opened heated debates on the impact of Artificial Intelligence on changing the economy and society. Having in mind this international landscape, in this short paper we discuss the Polish AI research community, some of its main achievements, opportunities and limitations. We put this discussion in the context of the current developments in the international AI community. Moreover, we refer to activities of Polish scientific associations and their initiative of founding Polish Alliance for the Development of Artificial Intelligence (PP-RAI). Finally two last editions of PP-RAI joint conferences are summarized. 1. Introductory remarks Artificial Intelligence (AI) began as an academic discipline nearly 70 years ago, while during the Dartmouth conference in 1956 the expression Artificial Intelligence was coined as the label for it. Since that time it has been evolving a lot and developing in the cycles of optimism and pessimism [27]. In the first period research in several main subfields were started but the expectations the founders put were not fully real­ ized. Thus, the disappointments and cutting financing in the 1970s led to the first, so called, AI winter. The research was intensified again in 1980s, mainly with promoting practically useful, narrow purpose systems, such as expert systems, based on symbolic approaches and logic [21]. Nevertheless, they were not so successful as it was expected. Then, important changes in AI paradigms concern non-symbolic and more numeri­ cal approaches [1]. During the end of 1980s many researchers focused interests on * Institute o f Applied Computer Science, Jagiellonian University, and AGH University o f Science and Technology, Cracow, gjn@gjn.re ^Institute of Computing Sciences, Poznan University o f Technology, Poznan, jerzy.stefanowski@cs.put.poznan.pl 160 G. J. Nalepa, J. Stefanowski methodological inspirations coming from statistics, numerical methods, optimization, decision analysis and modeling uncertainty. It helped in a significant progress in new machine learning methods, rebirth of neural networks, new developments of natural language processing, image recognition, multi-agent systems, and also robotics [11]. Several researchers proposed new approaches to manage uncertainty and imprecision, while others significantly improved genetic and evolutionary computations which started computational intelligence subfield [10, 7]. All of these efforts led to the new wave of applications, which were far beyond what earlier systems did and additionally boosted the growing interest in AI. Since the beginning of this century one can observe the next renaissance of the neu­ ral networks research, in particular promoting deep learning, and intensive develop­ ment of machine learning together with appearance of Big Data [33]. Other advances were also done in computer vision, improving perception of intelligent agents which can perform more complex tasks. New ways of interactions with human were also developed in fields of Ambient Intelligence and smart devices [26]. Moreover, robotics benefits from the fast pace of advances in machine learning, computational intelli­ gence, uncertainty representation and handling, decision making, and multi agent systems. A strong improvement of perception in robots supported progress in hu­ man robot interfaces, their understanding and learning [30]. Furthermore successful techniques were introduced in speech recognition, natural language processing, au­ tonomous systems and self-driving cars. The trustworthy, human-center AI systems and explainability are of crucial importance in AI based system, as in this area the decisions made by algorithms may have immediate physical consequences, and may put at risk human health or lives, e.g. in autonomous driving. Concluding, the never seen before peak of hype around artificial intelligence has occurred in the last years. However this peak is different than previous ones. It is much stronger and touches different recipients than the research communities only. It seems to look ” like a storm’ changing the world” . One can notice that several factors came together in the last decade: • Several new methods, e.g. deep neural networks, and intensive developments of older approaches led to a scientific breakthrough, • Appearance of Big Data, where large volumes of data, having different represen­ tations, enable several algorithms to be more efficient and surprisingly accurate in solving difficult, real world complex tasks; Big Data is also characterized by other properties such as Velocity, Veracity or other complexities which have opened new research and application perspectives [17], • Increasingly powerful computers with greater storage and parallel processing become available and cheaper; the easier availability of GPU hardware and computations had a big impact on training of deep neural networks, • Advances in solving spectacular real life case studies, e.g. self-driving cars, games such as Go, intelligent query answering and NLP in IBM Watson, medical image recognition, Big Data mining, where intelligent systems could achieve accuracy comparable to humans, Artificial Intelligence Research Community and Associations in Poland 161 • AI techniques were moved from laboratories to industrial practice, which also attracted a wider attention from other communities than academic researchers. Furthermore real financial investments were made by many commercial compa­ nies. It increased the number of real world applications and boosted selling AI-based products, which provided added economical values. Several reports, such as [2, 25], present information showing that the AI sector has become a growing target area for such investments in the last decade. For instance according to [2] private equity investments in AI companies and start-up accelerated from 2016 (e.g. it doubled from 2016 to 2017 reaching 16 USA billion). The reader can also refer to the fifth chapter of [25] for more details on revenues of AI market. These economical aspects constitute a large difference to earlier moments of general interest in AI and its opportunities. Nowadays, many managers, economists, sociologists or administrative officials per­ ceive Artificial Intelligence as a general — purpose technology that will revolution­ ary change the world economy and society. On one side AI applications may improve productivity gain, saving costs and enable better resource allocation. On the other hand, statistical reports of [2] demonstrate that the large scale effects of AI requires investments in a number of complementary inputs (e.g. infrastructure, collected data but also to train a specialized staff). The last year McKinsey Global AI report [18] provides results of a large survey (over 2360 participants from various companies all over the world) showing nearly 25% increase of AI applications in standard business processes, where in over 50% they significantly reduced costs. Moreover, 63% respondents are seeing growing re­ turn from investments (ROI) from the AI adoption. The highest revenue increases are reported most often in marketing and sales while cost decreases most often in manufacturing. This report also shows which AI methods are the most popular in particular domains. Furthermore other pooling results include risk identifications, in particular a limited access to well prepared data, its good quality, along with privacy protection issues. To sum up, nowadays AI is more and more applied in various areas and often produces money returns. One can also informally say that business began to believe in intelligent products. Besides benefits of applying AI, several people (also coming from sociology, ethics, philosophy or law) are considering limitations, risks and ethical issues. While philosophers raise more fundamental questions about what we should do with the fast developing AI systems and robots, what the systems themselves should do, what risks they involve, and how human can control these systems1 or how to relate them to respecting human rights, democratic values. The researchers from other fields consider other risks or limitations such as threat to privacy, security, safeness, legal responsibility2. Changes of human work, replacing or moving people from one to another new job, continuous education and skill development are next elements of societal A I impacts. 1For a brief definition o f research on this field and links to main debates the reader can consult the section entitled Ethics o f Artificial Intelligence and Robotics inside Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy h t tp s : / /p la to .s ta n fo r d .e d u /e n t r ie s /e t h ic s -a i / . 2 Many intensive discussions on so called superintelligence and the problem o f human control over so fast developing and more and more powerful AI systems or robots have also been undertaken by researchers coming from various fields for instance see the summary available in [19]. 162 G. J. Nalepa, J. Stefanowski This raises many public considerations about regulations and needs to ensure trustworthy, human-center A I systems. In particular it is visible in European Union experts’ discussions, working polices and several recent recommendations or white papers. For instance last year the High-Level Expert Group on AI presented Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. In February 2020 European Commission released a special white paper on AI, which provides their views on the upcoming policy, addresses the risks associated with AI usage, and discusses future regulatory steps on Artificial Intelligence. From research perspectives it opens several new challenges how to incorporate these recommendations into inte",,2020.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/fcds-2020-0009', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2478/fcds-2020-0009?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2478/fcds-2020-0009, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

More than 85 % of pigs supplied to meat processing plants of the Republic are provided by different combinations of interbreed hydridization. For the effective development of this branch in the Republic, the Scientific-Practical Center on Animal Husbandry of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus organized the system of selection and breeding work in pig breeding directed to create new competitive breeds, types, and hydrides of pigs adapted to the industrial production conditions and not inferior to the productivity of the analogs of the world selection. The main link of this system is the first-order breeding plants (nucleus units) as new-type plants dealing with the selection and breeding of the best animals with the outstanding genetically conditioned breeding and productive qualities. The second link of this system is the first-order breeding breeders that are completed with high-valuable breeding pigs from the leading nucleus unit and are engaged in their reproduction to obtain grandparents (GP).

INTRODUCTION 
The coronavirus pandemic is a challenge to educators, policy makers, and ordinary people. In facing the threat from COVID-19, school systems and global institutions need “to address the essential matter of each human being and how they are interacting with, and affected by, a much wider set of biological and technical conditions.”[1] Educators must grapple with the societal issues that come with the intent of ensuring the safety of the public. To some, “these are actually as important as the biological concerns of people.”[2] 
          The current global crisis shows that “scientifically, socially, and politically the economy and technosphere are not just related, they are integral to a comprehensive response to major challenges.”[3] In developing these responses, scientists, government leaders, and policy makers need to consider the vulnerabilities of people, especially those in “thrown away” groups.[4] Jerome Ravetz explains that “microscopic viral predators cull our populations, as ever, but with a selection that is not natural but social and political.”[5] Educators must address the underlying vulnerabilities and evaluate the virus as a threat to academic experiences and access to a fair education. 
ANALYSIS 
 
Critical Pedagogy 
 
         By definition, the critical approach to teaching is about the problem-posing method of education developed by Paolo Freire. In his Pedagogy of the Oppressed, he proposed a paradigm shift away from the banking method of learning wherein teachers deposit knowledge into the minds of students. Critical pedagogy is an educational approach that challenges students to develop the ability to recognize and criticize dominating theories and evaluate them in their social context. Teachers press students to recognize oppression and try to remedy oppression in their culture.[6] Despite the lack of in-person interaction between the teacher and the students, the effort to use innovative teaching techniques like critical pedagogy should continue. 
          Online learning is not just about the use of technology, although the internet is crucial in the delivery of content. Since human beings are creators of value, they determine the meaning and purpose of technology. In this way, the set of values people have will influence online learning. Teachers cannot be more concerned about outcomes than about the process itself. The process is crucial since the ability of the student to think critically is developed in the exchange between the student and the teacher. The teacher cannot simply dump loads of information (deposit knowledge) but must pose problems to test the analytical and critical skills of students.[7] 
           Education is about how people humanize the world.  Policy makers miss the point when they focus on the delivery but do not pay attention to the substantive aspect of learning, which is human empowerment. Education is meant to expand the freedom of people. Education should be seen as an integrative activity. Learning is a formative process that aims to develop the human person. Without the face-to-face encounter between teacher and students, the challenge is finding ways to make learning an effective means to mold the values of young people. 
 
Online Critical Pedagogy & the Role of Technology 
 
           Physical distance appears to be an impediment in realizing the ideals of learning. The lack of contact between the teacher and the students may prevent a more meaningful interaction since online instruction is impersonal. It can be argued that there is no alternative to some classroom activities, especially laboratory experiments in science courses. The total classroom environment naturally influences the behavior of students when it comes to academic work: the look in the eyes of the professor, the caring ways of a teacher, or the pressure while taking exams contribute to an experience that only a classroom setting can provide. If implemented properly, technology can facilitate the personal relationships between teachers and students while providing meaningful experiences. 
          With the current need for online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, gadgets are indispensable.  Some would even consider gadgets an extension of the human body. A mobile phone is not just any instrument; it has evolved into a novel way of being in the world. Our gadgets are a means of seeing how the outside world unfolds. Modern technological tools allow the interface of people in many fields of experience in a globalized environment. Computers and other digital devices extend the meaning and value of human freedom. For example, a laptop provided to a poor child can redefine the meaning of and what the future might hold for that child. The device is crucial to the whole learning process. Modern tools are critical to self-discovery and greater freedom. 
           The values that people embrace will matter in the new normal. The internet has provided a new democratic space that empowers groups and individuals to express themselves and to understand the world.[8] In an online class, students and teachers alike need to analyze big picture questions and layers of information. For example, the student in an ethics or philosophy class can reflect on the realities of life. With the proper guidance, online education should help define the meaning of moral commitment and human responsibility. 
CONCLUSION 
          Before the pandemic, policy makers had been pursuing the goals of a globalized economy. They had been fashioning and promoting programs that cater to the interests of a consumer-driven world that has deprived the poor of opportunity. When the pandemic struck, globalization suddenly came to a halt and people realized the things that truly matter in life – family, love, and life itself. The new normal must now emphasize the role of education as a source of inner strength that can empower the person to live well reinforcing values based on a social consciousness. 
         Critical pedagogy is possible under the new normal. The distance between the teacher and student does not make the educational process less real and in the absence of a vaccine, online learning is the safest strategy. Governments cannot freeze an entire school year since education is the only way out from poverty for millions. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a reason to re-imagine teaching using technology to encourage all students to question systems of oppression or greed, as the persistent pursuit of the truth is what education is all about.

75ad47904204d344b574c65c3d5ae63c8b81bcfe,Factors Influencing Technological Capability Building in the Nigerian Solar Energy Industry,"Technological capability study has continued to gain ground as recognisable progress is being made in the resource-based view (RBV) theory. As a matter of fact, it has become more relevant in the context of a developing nation, such as Nigeria, as a means to create economic development. Using the Panda and Ramanathan methodology for measuring technological capability (TC) in the electric sector, this paper adopted the indicators from the paper to investigate the effects of factors affecting TC on the Nigerian solar energy firms’ TCs. The results of seemingly unrelated regressions showed that both internal and external factors significantly affect technological capability in the solar energy industry in different directions, but similar directions to organizational capability of the solar energy firms’ in Nigeria. BACKGROUND The introduction of renewable energy technologies (RETs) to address the problem of incessant supply and poverty of electricity in both urban and rural areas has been an international development strategy in the developing countries (Tigabu et al., 2015). More so that most RETs are usually diffused product of innovations introduced to the developing nations. Nigeria, a developing nation, is blessed with arrays of renewable energy resources. Among the resources in vast deposit in the country is the solar energy from the sun. But the share of solar energy to the national energy mix is too small compared to the projected estimate envisioned for Nigeria so that its economy can be reckoned with among the twenty largest economies by the year 2020. Based on ECN (2012), the electricity supply projected under the optimistic economic growth rate of 13% required that by year 2010 and 2015 solar electricity supply would have reached 490 MW and 2,543 MW respectively. Also, that by year 2020, 2025 and 2030 solar electricity supply will be 6,417 MW, 15,970 MW and 39,738 MW respectively. But Sambo (2009) had envisaged earlier that hindrances such as the one relating to technical and financial are great barriers to solar energy technologies proliferation. However, Panda and Ramanathan (1996) opined that the most important task for utilities dealing with electricity in the world especially the developing countries, such as Nigeria, besides financing, seems to be the development of indigenous technological capability. This was reiterated by Vidican (2012) that development of indigenous technological capability in solar energy technologies is required for developing countries to catch-up or leap-frog the developed counter-part. It was also inferred from Akinbami (2001) and Akarakiri et al. (2010) specifically for Nigeria that building technological capability in solar energy technologies become imperative for the indigenous firms in order to provide sustainable electricity supply in the country. The existing literature widely recognizes the great importance of technological capabilities for long-term sustainable growth, particularly in less advanced countries (Bell, 2010; Ockwell et al., 2010). At the micro-level, technological capabilities are defined as the knowledge and skills that the firm needs to acquire, use, adapt, improve and create technology (Lall, 1992; Bell and Pavitt, 1995). Developing countries, which traditionally lack indigenous capabilities to generate new technologies, commonly rely on diverse mechanisms of international technology Archives of Business Research (ABR) Vol.8, Issue 3, Mar-2020 Copyright © Society for Science and Education, United Kingdom 117 transfer (Pietrobelli, 2000). Multinational enterprises (MNEs) have played a central role in this process. Indeed, the evolutionary view of technological change, along with intense debate on the globalization of innovation, has drawn increasing attention to MNEs as creators of technology across national boundaries (Iammarino et al., 2008). Although, research on innovation processes has shown that the technological capabilities held by firms comprise not only information codified in capital goods or documents (patents, manuals, etc.), but also include the tacit knowledge embodied in individual skills and firm routines (Dosi, 1988). These elements of knowledge are costly to transfer and therefore highly organization-specific (von Hippel, 1994). This means that removing trade barriers and providing developing countries with intellectual property rights (IPR) and resources for technology imports is not sufficient to enable countries to catch up to the technological frontier (Ockwell et al., 2010). Rather, catching up requires building local technological capabilities through the cumulative, costly and time-consuming process of technological learning (Bell and Figueiredo, 2012). Technological capability building is the outcome of complex interactions among individuals, firms, and other organizations within specific institutional frameworks and geographical locations (Edquist and Johnson, 1997). Thus, alongside the technological strategies and profiles of large corporations, the characteristics of local actors and institutional environments are important for determining the impact of MNEs on local capability building (Cantwell and Iammarino, 2003; Iammarino, 2005). Capabilities are built through interactions both within the firm and with external actors (Malerba, 1992). Among these interactions, a crucial role is played by the cooperation in research and development (R&D) and innovative activities, where such cooperation can involve other firms in the same sector, suppliers, customers, consultants, and scientific institutions like universities and public research centres. The outcomes of these interactions form the basis for the distinction between technological competence and capabilities introduced by von Tunzelmann and Wang (2003). Whilst competences are understood as enhanced inputs to produce goods and services, capabilities generally involve different forms of learning (Malerba, 1992) and the accumulation of new knowledge, eventually embodied in new products and new processes (Iammarino et al., 2012). Therefore, in order to expand the participation of local companies in more technology intensive activities in the value chain requires technological capabilities (Amsden, 2001). These are critical for enabling developing countries to leapfrog with respect to energy technologies, and incorporate available technologies into their development processes (Goldemberg, 2008). This was also the case with Panda and Ramanathan (1996) on the electricity industry, that the most important task for utilities besides financing, is the development of technological capability. This study considered the methodology for assessment of technological capability development as suggested in the work of Panda and Ramanathan (1996). Their work considered technological capabilities into three major categories i.e. strategic, tactical, and supplementary capabilities. In addition, they considered another one which is nontechnological, called steering capability. This is included to emphasize the fact that without it technological capabilities cannot be effectively deployed and upgraded. From the procedural steps for the development of a technological capability enhancement plan, this paper examine how the influencing factors affect the technological capability as stated in the work of Panda and Ramanathan (1996).

URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.14738/abr.83.7887. 118 METHODOLOGY Sampling Technique. The main instrument is a set of structured questionnaire designed to collect information from the firms. Whereas, selection of the sample population required a multistage sampling technique. First, the Yamane formula for proportions at 95 percent confidence level found in Israel (2012) was adopted in the determination of sample size. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 60 firms obtained from a population size of 73 firms found in the business directory belonging to solar energy firms. Thereafter, the second selection of respondents, the unit of analysis was based on purposive selection of one representative each and probability sampling technique of one out of every four technical staff in the solar energy firms. Out of 200 questionnaire administered, 178 questionnaire were retrieved and only 151 of them were considered suitable for the analysis. Method of Data Analysis. This involves the use of exploratory factor analysis and the use of a regression type known as seemingly unrelated regression analysis. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA). An EFA may be used for a variety of purposes such as reducing a large number of items from a questionnaire or survey instrument to a smaller number of components, uncovering latent dimensions underlying a data set, or examining which items have the strongest association with a given factor (DiStefano et al., 2009). Many indicator variables were used to understand a construct in this study. So to find an underlying structure to the entire set of latent variables, factor analysis technique was used. The objective was to find means of condensing the information contained in a number of original variables “indicators” to smaller set of variables with a minimal loss of information. Factor analysis provided insight into interrelationships among variables and underlying structure, which is an excellent starting point for many other multivariate techniques. Factor analyses were sequentially used in this study as follow: identifying latent structure, achieving data reduction, variable selection and obtained factor scores for further analysis. The critical assumptions underlying factor analysis are more conceptual than statistical. The overriding concern in factor analysis is much on character and composition of variables included in the analysis as their statistical qualities.

706fa41919d42e45aca3c0f548c1579e8f1101aa,Library Internet Use and Demographic Characteristics of Undergraduates in a Nigerian University: Uncovering the Areas of Need.,"This study investigated undergraduates of Federal University of Technology Owerri, Nigeria to ascertain whether their demographic profile was a characteristic of library internet usage. Data used for the study was a textual analysis of statistic register on library internet use from May 2017 – June 2018. The study population consisted of 2682 valid name entries during the period under study. Findings revealed that FUTO has greater number of male undergraduates and this is due to the academic structure of the institution.  Discipline wise demographic characteristics showed that undergraduates from Agricultural Economics made most use of the library internet in School of Agriculture and Agricultural Technology (SAAT) while those in department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) were the most users in School of Engineering and Engineering Technology (SEET). Also, undergraduates from Information Management Technology (IMT) and Project Management Technology (PMT) used the internet most in School of Management Technology (SMAT) while those in Biotechnology (BIO) were the most users in School of Biological Sciences (SOBS). Further findings revealed that undergraduates from Surveying and Geoinformatics (SVG) were the most library internet users in School of Environmental Technology (SOET) while Biomedical Technology undergraduates (BMT) made use of the internet more than their counterparts in the School of Health Technology (SOHT). Similarly, Computer Science (CSC) students used the internet most in School of Physical Sciences (SOPS). On the overall faculty level, School of Engineering and Engineering Technology (SEET) made most use of the library internet than other Schools. In terms of study level, it was revealed that final year (500 level) students used the library internet most. Having uncovered the disparity in library internet use, the study recommends among others that embedded librarians in FUTO should promote library operations and services through constant connection and communication with their various departments, continuous marketing and awareness creation of the library’s internet facility.

Methods: we include the clinical randomized controlled trials and prospective and retrospective controlled trials using the single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with the anteromedial (AM) or transtibial (TT) techniques published up to July 2018, were retrieved from PubMed, Embase databases and Cochrane Library. The relevant articals were assess the methodological quality by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale and the methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) csale. Results: (7)RCTs were included, (9) prospective and retrospective controlled trials were include, with a total of (1418) patients. (723) patients and (695) patients in the AM group and the TT group. And better results were found in the AM group, assessing the postoperative functional outcome of the dichotomous negative rate of the Lachman test, pivots test, IKDC grades and the continuous IKDC scores and lysholm scores (P<0.05). Conclusions: the outcome of the single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction may lead a contribution that the right now the AM technology may lead a significational better clinical outcome but we still need more research in the future. 1. Background Since the arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) reconstruction come into being. It soon become the standard method and most frequently performed surgical procedures world wide[1] because of the low success rate and result in persistent rotational laxity[2] in traditional methods of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. As the time pass by the technology have a huge advanced[3] and numbers of the method were defined in this area[4]. In the past-by the transtibial(TT) technique of the femoral tunnel played the most important role in single-bundle ACL reconstruction[5].but several researches and reports shows the TT technique may lead to possible failure due to the nonanatomic in this method[6]. Therefore the surgeons aim their choice to the the anteromedial (AM) technique which the anteromedial portal helps the surgeon get the freedom to replace the graft to the anatomical position . nowadays AM technique is the most common type of anatomical ACL reconstruction and it is now commonly accepted and adopted to ACL reconstrcution[7, 8]。 Since 2010 there are many research[9] have reported the comparison between anteromedial and the transtibial and some of them show that the AM technique may have a superior outcome, last year two meta-analysis[10, 11](up to 2015) get agreement on the results that based on the physical examination and scoring system results the AM technique is superior to the TT technique. But the RCT and the retrospective results in recent year also lead a idea that the two technique have no clinical differences. So in our meta-analysis we include some new research to make a comparison of the clinical outcome between the AM and TT technique in single-bundle ACL reconstruction. 2020 4th International Conference on Computer Engineering, Information Science & Application Technology (ICCIA 2020) Published by CSP © 2020 the Authors 45",,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'http://www.clausiuspress.com/conferences/ACSS/ICCIA 2020/CIA507.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.23977/iccia2020008?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.23977/iccia2020008, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

More than 85 % of pigs supplied to meat processing plants of the Republic are provided by different combinations of interbreed hydridization.For the effective development of this branch in the Republic, the Scientific-Practical Center on Animal Husbandry of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus organized the system of selection and breeding work in pig breeding directed to create new competitive breeds, types, and hydrides of pigs adapted to the industrial production conditions and not inferior to the productivity of the analogs of the world selection.The main link of this system is the first-order breeding plants (nucleus units) as new-type plants dealing with the selection and breeding of the best animals with the outstanding genetically conditioned breeding and productive qualities. The second link of this system is the first-order breeding breeders that are completed with high-valuable breeding pigs from the leading nucleus unit and are engaged in their reproduction to obtain grandparents (GP).Assessing the level of the technological development of pig breeding in Belarus during the period to the 2030 year, we predicted the indices for the all predictable years (2020–2030). The existing level of the technological development of the pig breeding branch is assessed as the mean one.

1bdb1ca02ba099fa4521cd1c3f76220834dacb31,Foreword,"Dear friends!

Allow me to congratulate the winners of the Contest for BRICS Young Leaders whose papers are published in this special issue of the BRICS Journal of Economics, partner of the Contest. No doubt, these articles bring to the BRICS agenda the most promising projects for promoting practical cooperation among the youth of our five countries.

The Contest for BRICS Young Leaders was held within the annual BRICS International School by the Russian National Committee on BRICS Research and supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, the Alexander Gorchakov Public Diplomacy Fund and other partner organizations. The BRICS International School was initially established to train young professionals in BRICS studies through educational experiences focusing on fostering the pentalateral partnership of the BRICS countries. As the project evolves, we are proud to say that it has been widely contributing to building the pool of talented youth from BRICS and beyond.

On behalf of the Russian National Committee of BRICS Research, I would like to extend our gratitude and appreciation to the BRICS Journal of Economics for the support of the Contest as a part of the youth track within the Russian BRICS Chairmanship in 2020. Let me express my hope that the BRICS Journal of Economics will further expand its impact in promoting knowledge and cutting-edge research as one of the most forward-looking journals in the field of BRICS studies.

Since the creation of BRICS in 2009, the participating countries have made a significant progress in economic, technological, social, and humanitarian development, and have strengthened their positions in the institutions of the global governance. During its first decade, efforts of the BRICS countries became one of the key factors in world politics and global economic development.

This year Russia took over the Chairmanship in BRICS for the third time under the motto “BRICS Partnership for Global Stability, Shared Security and Innovative Growth.” Its main purpose was determined as raising standards and quality of life of the peoples of our five countries. The Chairmanship is built on the three pillars of BRICS strategic partnership — policy and security, economy and finance, and cultural and humanitarian contacts. As a part of its policy track, BRICS countries continued to promote universal principles of international law, central role of the United Nations in international affairs and contributed to forming of a more democratic and multilateral system of the global governance.

Efforts of the BRICS countries within economic pillar focused on the renewal of the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership 2025. The new Strategy emphasized trade,

The Quality of Competition Law Institutions and Enforcement 5 investment and finance, support of the digital economy and sustainable development as its priority areas. By adopting the Strategy, the five countries expressed their commitment to strengthen cooperation within the BRICS businesses communities, to facilitate the reform of the global trade and financial system, to advance cooperation within the BRICS Contingency Reserve Arrangement and the New Development Bank. The BRICS countries prioritized working in the fields of innovation and technology and addressing the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, sustainable development, climate change, energy, infrastructure development and food security.

Within the humanitarian track, Russia prioritized strengthening of people-to-people contacts with the development of the youth track one of its core tasks. The BRICS countries continued strengthening youth exchanges in the fields of science, technology and innovation, volunteerism and entrepreneurship. It is illustrated by the comprehensive support of youth initiatives within the Russian Chairmanship and reflected in the XII BRICS Summit Moscow Declaration.

This year BRICS reached a number of practical agreements to support our economies to recover from the health crises. BRICS countries agreed to support small, medium and micro businesses to participate in international trade, to foster interbank cooperation and strengthen the role of the New Development Bank.

Certainly, the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak affected the Russian BRICS Chairmanship this year. The global healthcare crises and its implications for BRICS became the cross-cutting issue of discussions within the meetings at all levels and all fields of our cooperation. As an example of BRICS response to this challenge, the BRICS countries agreed to establish an early warning system for epidemiological threats and to develop specific steps for the legal regulation of medical products that will improve our capacities to combat similar threats in the future.

I am proud that the Contest for BRICS Young Leaders and the BRICS International School engaged so many capable young people to elaborate solutions addressing the most pressing issues for the global community. The innovative ideas to foster partnership and friendship among the peoples of BRICS proposed by the participants of these projects will bring a positive change. I am convinced that with the contribution of the young leaders to the BRICS agenda, we will be able to solve issues of international importance and to build a better world.",BRICS Journal of Economics,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.brics-econ.org/sys/raw.php?o=2015&p=ArticlePDF', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38050/2712-7508-2020-1-4-1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38050/2712-7508-2020-1-4-1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

86bdf62b4a8fdfd58fc9a951a92df457f21d2b75,"Spawning Four-Year, ABET-AccreditablePrograms in Cybersecurity from Existing Computer Science Programs in Thailand","Purpose–Thailand faces many cybersecurity challenges. In the first few months of 2022 alone, there were over 300,000 cyber-attacks in the country, and annually the problem has gotten significantly worse. It is estimated that Thailand loses 286 billion US dollars per annum due to cybercrimes. These attacks include credit card fraud, phishing, ransomware, scamming, infor-mation, and identity theft, business email compromises, child pornography, intellectual prop-erty infringements, cyberstalking and harassment, denial of service, botnets, fake news, and stolen funds. To defend against cyber criminals, well-trained professionals in cybersecurity are needed.By 2025, there is an expected shortfall of over four million cybersecurity workers globally. We examine what it would take to spawn an accreditable four-year curriculum in cy-bersecurity from a typical Thai Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. At present, there are few university programs in Thailand dedicated to cybersecurity. We hope this work inspires educational institutions to develop quality four-year degrees in cybersecurity, with the goals of meeting workforce demands, reducing cybercrime, and promoting Thailand as a viable and healthy place to conduct e-business.

Method–The paper employs expert analysis to forge an accreditable program in cybersecu-rity from a computer science program.Results–The authors describe an ABET-accreditable program in cybersecurityand show how to develop it in a step-by-step manner.

Conclusion–An ABET-accreditable program in cybersecurity can be spawned from a computer science program with relatively few additional courses and modifications while placing more emphasis on ABET's crosscutting concepts.

Recommendations–Institutions that are interested in developing four-year cybersecurity pro-grams can begin crafting them in the manner described in this work. 

Research Implications–Cybersecurity professionals can be developed.

Practical Implications–New quality cybersecurity programs can be developed promptly.

Social Implications–There will be more qualified professionals to help fight cybercriminals.

e2465e5aa824b9f958ac6fb8cf84630973978f37,Exploring Learner Resilience and Performance of First-Year Computer Science Undergraduate Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This paper presents the findings from a research project exploring the impact of learner resilience as part of the shift to online delivery of learning, teaching and assessment amidst national ""lockdown"" measures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This exploration of resilience was undertaken as part of the delivery of a first-year undergraduate computer science degree programme in a UK higher education institution over two academic years. Resilience was measured by the Nicholson McBride Resilience Questionnaire (NMRQ). The responses from the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 student cohorts (N=214) illustrate that overall learner resilience as measured by NMRQ does not appear to have had a significant impact upon learner success as measured by the mean overall first-year performance. This is an outcome that differs from previous work and may be a consequence of the disruptive (and ongoing) circumstances arising from the pandemic. However, this work identifies that the factor ""I try to control events rather than being a victim of my circumstances"" appears to promote success and the factor ""I trust my intuition"" may have been slightly detrimental to overall success. As we start to consider the post-pandemic new (ab)normal, learners will continue to face significant personal challenges that will impact upon their engagement with their studies and their performance and progression; thus the insights offered from this UK university study can help to inform emerging academic and pastoral practice for undergraduate computer science education.",Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,2022.0,12,"{'url': 'http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/49783/1/iticse2022_paper123_submitted.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'mit', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3502718.3524764?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3502718.3524764, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9579c012874d7148ad8704edbad8b4160a3cf04c,A Fuzzy-Based Evaluation of E-Learning Acceptance and Effectiveness by Computer Science Students in Greece in the Period of COVID-19,"In this paper, a fuzzy-based evaluation method is presented for the impact of e-learning on several aspects of the learning lives of academic students of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the academic year 2020–2021 was considered when a general lockdown was imposed in Greece and all courses were delivered exclusively through the web. The evaluation criteria are (i) e-learning acceptance, (ii) learning effectiveness, (iii) students’ engagement and (iv) socializing and interpersonal relationships in the educational community. The evaluation was conducted through questionnaires. Ninety two (92) undergraduate and postgraduate students and Ten (10) computer science in-structors of the department of Informatics of the University of Piraeus, Greece, participated in this survey. The questionnaire answers were analyzed using a fuzzy-based mechanism. Particularly, five fuzzy sets were used to describe the 5-point Likert scale answers to the questionnaires with linguistic values, and four other fuzzy sets were used for the description of the evaluation results concerning the four defined evaluation criteria. Moreover, 209 fuzzy rules were created to analyze and calculate the evaluation results per criterion, considering both the students’ answers (119 fuzzy rules) and the instructors’ answers (90 fuzzy rules) to the questionnaires. The gain of this approach is that the analysis of evaluation data with fuzzy rules imitates the human way of thinking and, thus, makes the process more explainable. The evaluation results showed a positive impact of e-learning on student confidence, self-discipline and active participation and a negative impact on student interpersonal relationships. The impact of e-learning on other learning issues was neutral.",Electronics,2023.0,9,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/2/428/pdf?version=1674040567', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/electronics12020428?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics12020428, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0138a0ff21659c8ea5b1c91c70e1258c67feec84,An analysis of international mobility and research productivity in computer science,"In this article, we study the international mobility of researchers in the field of computer science (CS). Our analysis hinges upon Scopus data spanning a time period of 30 years (1991–2020) and involves a total of 969,835 researchers and 8,412,543 publications. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we characterize mobility as a fairly common phenomenon in CS, we highlight a strong correlation with standard bibliometric indicators at all seniority levels and a lower propensity of female researchers to relocate internationally than their male colleagues. Second, we analyze individual career paths building from them a mobility graph and identifying common patterns, such as the most traveled connections between different countries, whether they are equally traversed in both directions and the most frequently visited countries. The temporal evolution of the above patterns within our 30-year time frame is also investigated. The United States emerged as a preferred destination for internationally mobile authors, with strong connections to China (from the early 2000s), Canada, and several prominent European countries, most notably the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.",Scientometrics,2023.0,5,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11192-023-04837-9.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s11192-023-04837-9?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-023-04837-9, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The current research performs a longitudinal study that explores the use of LearnEval, a comprehensive peer assessment platform, in two computer science courses in two consecutive years. Both courses followed a Project-Based Learning (PBL) approach, allowing a peer assessment component to be easily integrated. In 2020-2021 academic year, 78 students participated in the process in a 3$^{rd}$ year Web Applications Design course. In the following year, a subset of the same students (54) participated in the activity in a 4$^{th}$ year Human-Computer Interaction course. A quantitative analysis of the outcomes in the two years was performed and the results were compared. Furthermore, the LearnEval usability was assessed. Therefore, the current work addresses two research questions: (1) How do the outcomes of the peer assessment activity in the 4$^{th}$ year course compare to the previous year when the students attended the process for the first time? (2) How did the students perceive LearnEval usability in the two years? The main findings show that the results were slightly improved in the second year of attending the peer assessment process in terms of involvement, reviewing skills, grades assigned and quality of the feedback provided.","International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing",2023.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICSTCC59206.2023.10308452?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC59206.2023.10308452, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

073b78b050d8a53170f0ee2f210fa5bfd1f55194,A Preliminary Analysis of Indiana Schools’ Implementation of Virtual Instruction and CS Education in the 2020-2021 School Year,"Two datasets, published by the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) related to Indiana schools’ implementation of virtual education and computer science (CS) instruction during the 2020-2021 school year, were analyzed. This research aims to explore schools’ virtual instructional practices during the unprecedented educational disruptions and understand the preparedness and execution of CS curricula. With quantitative and qualitative approaches, we first evaluated the percentages of different instructional modes, school districts’ implementation of virtual instruction, their support for students, successes and barriers schools experienced, as well as their future plans regarding virtual learning. Findings indicate that hybrid and virtual instruction were prevalent, with disparities in technology access and instructional quality, and schools shared barriers related to technology resources, teacher preparedness, and student engagement. In addition, this study reveals the unequal implementation of CS education, particularly in lower grade levels, underscoring the need for more dedicated resources and teacher support. These insights may help inform future educational strategies for multi-modality instruction and enhance the integration of CS education in K-12 curricula.

c9d16071abe3e6e4710d87ffb2fc06cd8bb03786,The Design and Impact of Remote Professional Development on Computer Science Instructional Coaching and Teaching in Chicago Public Schools During COVID-19,"This report presents outcomes of a RAPID Collaborative Research grant that supported a professional development series (“NEXT”) for high school Exploring Computer Science (ECS) teachers in Chicago Public Schools (CPS) during the 2020 – 2021 school year. The project aimed to develop processes and actions to mitigate the impact of remote instruction on students’ access to high-quality and equitable computer science (CS) instruction. The Chicago Alliance for Equity in Computer Science (CAFÉCS), a long-standing partnership between university computer science faculty, educational researchers, and CPS teachers and administrators, designed a series of professional development (PD) workshops for teachers, a coaching model with various one-on-one and group coaching options, and a professional learning community (PLC) to build coaches’ capacities to support teachers during the pandemic. Drawing on qualitative data, we analyzed instructional coaches’ and teachers’ experiences with remote PD during COVID-19. The instructional coaching team designed PD workshops and coaching structures around key ECS instructional strategies and prioritized teachers’ emotional needs throughout the pandemic-impacted school year. Teachers reported that focusing on key instructional strategies helped (re)ground them in the ECS framework and build community with and among students in the remote environment. Moreover, teachers felt emotionally supported by their coaches and gained a sense of community with other CS teachers. Findings suggest that districts should design PD to meet teachers’ instructional and emotional needs and invest in instructional coaches’ professional development.",,2022.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.51420/report.2022.3?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.51420/report.2022.3, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5f6db99a69998b1973789c94cc56810af8e513b8,Evolution and Impact of Instructional Coaching for Exploring Computer Science Teachers in a Large Urban District,"As states and districts adopt policies and programs to broaden participation in computer science, there is a growing need to effectively develop and support more computer science teachers. Instructional coaching is a form of professional development that districts can implement to provide ongoing support to teachers. In Chicago, a recent policy change made computer science a high school graduation requirement. The district adopted the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum and professional development program as the primary means for fulfilling the requirement. As part of the district’s effort to consistently offer equitable computer science experiences for all students, an emphasis was placed on supporting ECS teachers through coaching. Over the past five years, the district developed, implemented, and refined an instructional coaching model for ECS teachers. The coaching model continues to scale up across the district, with over 50 teachers participating in the 2019-2020 school year. The coaching team also adapted the model in response to the shift to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, the authors share details of the ECS coaching model in Chicago, its impact, and lessons learned from the past five years of implementation.","Research in Equitable and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology",2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/respect55273.2022.00023?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/respect55273.2022.00023, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

By using classification and clustering techniques, we analyze different data sets obtained by pre-processing the original data with information about students and their exams, and highlight which courses show a significant deviation from the typical progression of the courses of the same teaching year, as time changes. Finally, we give heat maps showing the order in which exams were taken by graduated students. The paper shows a reproducible methodology that can be applied to any degree course with a similar organization, to identify courses that present critical issues over time.

Spending more time on computers can lead to the development of various postural problems, resulting in pain and inefficiency in the workplace. Aim: To assess the knowledge of computer ergonomics among third and final year Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) students at VSPM’s dental college in Nagpur, Maharashtra, India. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional, questionnairebased study was conducted on third and final year students between November 2020 and February 2021 in the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology at VSPMDCRC, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Committee (IEC/VSPMDCRC/15/2020). A self-administered questionnaire, formulated and validated by independent subject experts, was used. A total of 216 students were included in the study over a two-month period. Informed consent was obtained from the students. The questionnaire consisted of 34 questions on computer usage and knowledge of ergonomics, and the responses were recorded. Descriptive statistics were performed using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 for Windows. Quantitative data were expressed as mean and standard deviation. The association between categorical variables was checked using the Chi-square test, with a significance level set at 5%. Results: The mean age of the students was 22.20 years total of 216 students, including 158 females and 58 males, were included in the study. The results showed that 20.37% of third year students (44/96) and 31.48% of final year students (68/96) were aware of the term ""ergonomics"". The majority of students were unaware of the principles of ergonomics. However, 169 (78.2%) students knew the correct position of the head and neck while using a computer. Additionally, 164 (75%) students were aware of the need for lower back support, 167 (77.3%) were aware of the placement of input devices, and 174 (80.6%) were aware of the alignment of devices. Moreover, 168 (77.8%) subject knew that the monitor and working surface should be glare-free, and 120 (55.6%) were aware that a sloped desk surface is required for reading or writing. Furthermore, 157 (72.7%) subjects used a headset or speakerphone while writing, typing, or talking on the phone, and 164 (75.9%) subjects took regular eye breaks. Conclusion: The present study highlights a lack of practical knowledge and application of ergonomics among the participants. There is a need to prioritise creating awareness and developing healthy ergonomics practices among dental students through Continuing Dental Education programs (CDE). The authors also recommend that the curriculum for healthcare courses should incorporate healthy ergonomics practices as a part of the curriculum.",Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.7860/jcdr/2024/64697.18910', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.7860/jcdr/2024/64697.18910?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.7860/jcdr/2024/64697.18910, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b9c7506fb495dc9d40da65fd696cc7d33c63e12b,Exploring the role of educational neuroscience in learning through the perspectives of adult vocational education students of computer science in the field of online learning. A case study,"Online learning had a decisive role in all levels of education during the pandemic. In this study, we will explore adult vocational education students of computer science that experienced the online education during the school academic year 2020–2021. The study attempts to explore the views of 10 adult students. At the same time, an attempt is made to determine the role of educational neuroscience in students' learning. Participants were asked to answer 14 questions about the online education they had experienced. This was followed by data analysis using NVivo software. According to the findings, 6 students identified the reasons why they prefer to be educated in a physical learning environment and 1 student stated that he prefers a mixed model that will include lessons with both physical and online presence. In addition, 9 out of 10 students stated that they prefer synchronous online teaching to asynchronous. Also, 7 out of 10 students identified that in the theoretical part they were able to achieve the expected learning outcomes but on the other hand, 6 out of 10 learners reported difficulties in attending the workshops. Nevertheless, 8 out of 10 stated that they were quite consistent with the obligations they had during the course. The findings indicate that the principles of educational neuroscience can be a critical component of effective online learning.","SouthEast European Design Automation, Computer Engineering, Computer Networks and Social Media Conference",2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/SEEDA-CECNSM53056.2021.9566229?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/SEEDA-CECNSM53056.2021.9566229, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The project was conducted in the US during the 2019-2020 academic year with twenty-two AP Computer Science teachers. The intervention was evaluated by comparing the College Board's 2020 national and state AP CSA and AP CSP exam statistics with the aggregate scores of the students in the classroom of the project's teacher cohort. Teacher surveys were also used to evaluate the impact of the study on teacher's perception and teaching practices. Results from this research show that Hispanic students in the research cohort passed the AP CSP test at the same rate as all students passing the AP CSP test in the cohort. This contrasts favorably with the national and state Hispanic passing AP CSP test takers which are reported as 10 to 13% below all students AP CSP passing test takers. The pedagogical interventions used here are one approach to promote equity in computer science education. This paper presents a description of the project, a comparison of the project's data to the 2020 national and state AP CSA and AP CSP exam statistics, a summary of the teacher survey data and recommendations for continued research in this area.",Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3430665.3456309?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3430665.3456309, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is because, with this information, the supervision process in thesis writing can run well. This study intends to analyze the segmentation and positioning of lecturers related to determine the thesis supervisor using the Clusterwise Bilinear Spatial Multidimensional Scaling Model (CBSMSM) method. The data used is survey data for fifth-semester bachelor students of the 2019/2020 academic year of the Department of Computer Science, Pakuan University. One hundred sixty-one student observations provide an assessment of 10 attributes regarding the characteristics of 32 lecturers of the department. Furthermore, the estimation of the segment coordinate parameters, lecturer coordinates, dimensions, and attributes simultaneously uses the alternating least square (ALS) algorithm. The number of segments and dimensions are selected based on the smallest sum square error (SSE) value for combining segments and other dimensions. As a result, we get four segments and four dimensions with an SSE value of 4864.003.

bbf411ae734f22219f7ef359744b2a7d9fcc8ba8,Trend analysis and forecasting of publication activities by Indian computer science researchers during the period of 2010–23,"Huge collections of published research documents are available in various repositories in Indian universities and research organizations. The efficient retrieval, estimation of research trends, and identification of research gaps with the global trend in different research areas, can be a great guiding tool for regulating research in the appropriate direction. This research attempts to analyse the trend of research activities carried out by Indian researchers in the discipline of Computer Science from 2010 to 19 and forecast the upcoming research trend for the years 2020–23. A repository of the abstracts based on domains given in the Computer Science Ontology (CSO) published by the Indian researchers is developed from the Scopus database. Document Index Graph document representation model is used to store the repository, shared phrases across the documents are extracted and phrase‐based similarity is computed. Combining the Single‐term and Phrase‐based similarity, the hybrid similarity is generated and similar documents are clustered using the DBSCAN clustering technique. Topics are identified for each cluster using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and are automatically labelled using CSO. For each topic, the trend analysis and forecasting have been done using the Auto‐Regressive Integrated Moving Average. For the assessment of the forecasting performance, the dataset from 2010 to 17 is used as a training dataset and 2018–19 as a testing dataset. The average forecasting for the year 2018 for all CSO domains belongs to the Good forecasting category with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) 18.34, and 2019 shows reasonable forecasting with MAPE 30.20 as per the MAPE interpretation given by Lewis. For each topic the average forecasting for years 2018–19 shows either Highly accurate, Good or Reasonable forecasting. As a result, the top four domains for the years 2020–23 are also identified which can help initial researchers in the identification of a relevant topic for research and exploration.",Expert Syst. J.

The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 resulted in the abrupt shutting of all the educational institutions (schools, colleges, and universities) in India. This resulted in dramatic changes in the education system with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Online learning is a competent and contactless method of teaching to remotely located students. 
Geography is a branch of science which deals with the study of the earth’s surface and the relationships between people and their environment. Geographers explore both the physical properties of the earth’s surface and the human societies spread across it. The subject matter of Geography containing different theory papers and practical papers cannot just be effectively taught in a classroom or laboratory but best enlightened on the field. For the effective learning process in the subject of Geography, students require on-ground observations, laboratory analysis, projects and dissertations, field surveying, computer mapping and analysis, field trips and excursions, etc. It helps the budding Geographers to acquire not only theoretical knowledge but also practical skills.
But the COVID-19 pandemic situation confronted the education system, forcing the educators in the field of Geography to shift to an online mode of teaching, leaving them with no option. During this crisis, the educators have given their best in teaching the subject matter of Geography to the students by using various open-source teaching aids by overcoming the issues like lack of training and professional technical support. This altered the traditional teaching and learning process in the field of Geography, which essentially affects the students of Geography. 
Thus, a case study was undertaken to assess the online teaching in the subject of Geography at the undergraduate level during the academic year 2020-21 from the student’s perspective.",International Journal of Scientific Research in Science and Technology,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.32628/ijsrst2183111', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32628/IJSRST2183111?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32628/IJSRST2183111, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, current structures and belief systems within the discipline have largely relegated computer science education researchers to the margins. Computer science education researchers are mainly 'lone-wolf' scholars in their departments that participate in CSER in addition to their more widely 'accepted' computer science research. As such, there has been a resistance to offer doctoral programs in CSER. Florida International University has not only invested inCSER by hiring a CSER tenure-track faculty member, they have also established a School of Computer Science Education and Engineering Education. Despite this investment, one obstacle remains the low visibility and understanding of computer science education research among undergraduate students. This makes establishing are search group of Ph.D. students challenging. In order to combat this obstacle, a four-year program was developed as a dedicated pipeline to the computer science education Ph.D. through a series of research experiences for undergraduates (REU). Summer 2020 consisted of the first cohort of this four year commitment. Given that 2020 was wrought with a series of unprecedented events, this REU was designed and executed virtually. This paper presents the plan, setting, execution, and subsequent evaluation of this virtual REU experience.

f7bb96593ac9de91d04a4ea0f6aa623bef5d0704,A Systematic Review of Computer Science Solutions for Addressing Violence Against Women and Children,"Violence against women and children is a public health issue of pandemic proportions. It is estimated that one in every three women worldwide has experienced physical, emotional, or sexual violence. Similarly, each year one out of two children are victims of some form of violence including domestic aggression and bullying. Due to the widespread use of the Internet and social media, women and children are now vulnerable to other types of violence such as cyber-bullying and online sexual or emotional harassment. To help alleviate this social problem, the use of computer science and related technologies has been leveraged in recent years. The Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, ubiquitous and mobile computing, pattern recognition, cloud computing and similar technologies, have been used to formulate solutions to detect and prevent violent acts against women and children. In this paper, a systematic review of some of the efforts that can help address the problem of violence against women and children is presented. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art of these contributions and identifies trends, architectures, technologies, and current open challenges. The survey was developed using a literature review of academic documents published from 2010 to 2020. The contributions were categorized into four application domains: online detection, offline detection, safety, and education.

a262af32e99df80ecd5d8df1aa278712b3dd7c4a,The TACS Model: Understanding Primary School Teachers’ Adoption of Computer Science Pedagogical Content,"Context. With the introduction of Computer Science (CS) into curricula worldwide, teachers’ adoption of CS pedagogical content is essential to ensure the long-term success of reform initiatives. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programs play a key role in this process. Unfortunately, adoption is seldom evaluated in CS-CPDs or CPDs in general. The result is a dearth of studies (i) modelling teachers’ adoption of CS pedagogical content or (ii) investigating factors influencing the uptake of this new discipline. Both aspects are crucial to design and characterize successful CPD programs. Objectives. We thus propose the Teachers’ Adoption of CS (TACS) model to investigate factors influencing the adoption of CS pedagogical content by teachers who are following a mandatory CS-CPD program. More specifically, the model proposes that contextual factors (e.g., age, gender, and general teaching experience), prior factors (e.g., experience, and CS perception), and acceptance factors (e.g., interest, and self-efficacy) may impact teachers’ adoption of CS pedagogical content. Methods. The study included 180 grades 5 and 6 teachers (students aged 9–11) that were following a mandatory CS-CPD program. The CS-CPD program involved participation in three-day-long sessions distributed over the 2019–2020 academic year. In between sessions, with the support of instructional coaches in the schools, teachers were encouraged, but not required, to adopt the CS pedagogical content. Therefore, during the CPD, and employing surveys based on the TACS model, we evaluated teachers’ adoption of the proposed content and investigated how the different factors influenced it. Results. At the PD-level, the results indicate that self-efficacy and interest queried during the CS-CPD are indicative of CS pedagogical content adoption. To shed more light on the relationship between these metrics, a more in-depth analysis was conducted with n = 92 teachers whose responses could be matched between sessions. While interest relates to how teachers adopt CS pedagogical content overall, both interest and self-efficacy are necessary to ensure the likelihood of a specific activity being adopted. Finally, individual teacher characteristics appear to impact adoption, with teachers with low experience with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) requiring onboarding, while middle-aged teachers require convincing to adopt CS pedagogical content. Conclusion. Three takeaways emerge from the study. First, the analyses confirm the foundation of the TACS model. Second, the findings establish the key role that interest plays in said model. Finally, the results support the relationship between the contextual, prior and acceptance factors on the adoption of primary school CS pedagogical content.",ACM Transactions on Computing Education,2022.0,7,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3569587', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3569587?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3569587, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Similarly, computing education and computational thinking programs are expanding in K12 schools but are hampered by concerns over teacher training and curriculum efficacy. This project sought to answer a question: is there a need for a more robust system of networking and resources for computer science education (CSEd) graduate students' The large response to initial community-building efforts indicates that this is likely the case. In just over one year, a global community of 190 graduate students and 90 CS faculty researchers and advisors have registered for a CSEd graduate focused community. Participant funding, while originally intended for in-person conference attendance and face-to-face meetings, has enabled this project to create study groups attended by 73 students and a virtual conference with 101 participants.

e483a855ac27ff884468fcccfbc5c4c2d9a068e1,Latin American Women and Computer Science: A Systematic Literature Mapping,"Contributions: The underrepresentation of women in computer science (CS) majors has long been a focus of attention in many academic documents, the majority of them from the United States and Europe. There is, however, a lack of information about educational interventions (EIs) for women in computing in Latin America. The contribution of this article is to cover this gap and describe what researchers in Latin American countries have been publishing about the recruitment and retention of women in the CS field. Background: Many EIs targeting female students at different educational levels—K-12, undergraduate, and graduate—have been undertaken to increase the participation of women in computing in Latin America. However, descriptions of these activities rarely are included in international academic databases. Research Questions: This literature mapping addresses two main research questions (RQ) about the topic of women in computing in academic publications in Latin American countries: RQ1) what are the characteristics of the publications about women in computing in Latin America? and RQ2) what are the published interventions to recruit and retain women in computing in Latin America? To answer RQ1, six subquestions were created covering year, language, country of origin, document type, and professional track. Furthermore, for RQ2, two subquestions were created involving educational level and the use of software development with a female theme. Methodology: This investigation used the systematic literature mapping process. To achieve a broad coverage of papers, the following sources were included: Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO, the proceedings of the Latin American Women in Computing Conference (LAWCC), and those of the Women in Technology (WIT) workshop colocated with the annual conference of the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC). The included papers were published in the last decade (2010–2020) and written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. Findings: The literature mapping encompasses 197 academic documents, 48.2% of which were written in Portuguese, 28.7% in English, and 23.1% in Spanish.

9b50093fa56a83831ed34533a5b161efbb671d9b,A high‐impact and expeditious journal for computational and algorithmic computer science research,"“Publish orperish”: but where to publish your paper? You worked hard on the research and wrote a fine piece. In some fields, monographs are the preferred format; in others, journals; and in computer science (CS), conferences are often preferred for their speed of publication (Chang et al., 2016). But which book publisher, journal, or conference? The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA, 2012) emphasizes paper-level metrics over venuelevel metrics. Signatories to the declaration, such as the Dutch Research Council (NWO), say that work should be judged on its own merits, not on the reputation of the journal or conference in which it appears. Nonetheless, the choice of venue is critical in dissemination of quality research. There are many journals and many conferences; some reputable, some not. Research published in Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering (CACAIE) tends to score well on paper-level metrics (Wang et al., 2020). Before I explain whywe chose to submit aCS application paper toCACAIE, we need some context. In CS as a rule, conferences are preferred over journals when first publishing a work. While this current de facto is not without debate (Vardi, 2009, 2020, 2021), the leading reason is that a conference peer-review cycle takes a few months, and your work (if accepted) appears within half a year of submission or less. Journals, by contrast, traditionally take a year or more to complete their reviewing process, and your work can appear several years after submission. As a famous example of the tardiness of journals, see the experience related by Chang et al. (2016). In the 21st century, journals are aware of the need for more expeditious review and publishing. As we discovered, a visionary leader among “traditional” journals is CACAIE.",Comput. Aided Civ.

Considering the importance of the Students Olympiad in computer science (CS) for the formation of future IT professionals in Ukraine, it was necessary to quickly develop appropriate approaches and safe formats for all stages of this Olympiad. Based on a survey of organizers, a review of Olympiads in CS in countries such as Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Armenia, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Croatia, and the Czech Republic was observed, and the format of the World Olympiad in Singapore was analyzed. Based on the analysis conducted and taking into account the importance of strict observance of all competition rules, including integrity and the importance of social contacts of all participants in the Olympic movement, it was decided that only the online format is insufficient and there was developed a safe format for the third and fourth stages of the competition, that includes a combination of in-person, online and mixed formats. Detailed requirements for each of these formats are formulated. Due to a significant increase in the load on the e-olymp server online verification system, the relevant software has been updated. The article provides detailed information on the holding of all four stages of the All-Ukrainian Students Olympiad in CS in a pandemic condition during 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 academic year using established formats and an improved verification system and describes a typical algorithm of the participant's actions. Therefore, new competition rules are detailed and innovative, taking into account unexpected circumstances in the whole world. They were tested and they proved their effectiveness, so they were also used for the finals of the Ukrainian Junior Olympiad in Informatics and the Ukrainian Girls’ Olympiad in Informatics. Since there is uncertainty about the pandemic in Ukraine, the article proposes to apply the proposed rules to hold all future stages of the Olympiad in Informatics during a pandemic at the official level.",Zhytomyr Ivan Franko State University Journal.

By reviewing the relevant research on machine learning or deep learning for specific sports or target actions based on computer vision image data input, the aim is to provide references for the application of unmarked motion capture technology in the field of sports motion recognition. The research employed a literature review methodology, conducting searches in six databases, namely Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), covering publications from January 2000 to June 2020. Through boolean logic operations on the retrieved literature, key information such as first author/publication year, types/targets of motion, participant information, camera parameters, image feature extraction techniques, action recognition algorithms, evaluation methods for action recognition quality, training and validation methods for image data, and performance metrics for action recognition were extracted. After screening, a total of 23 articles were included in the study. The findings revealed that $39 \%$ of the studies utilized machine learning algorithms based on support vector machines, while $35 \%$ employed deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks. Commonly used evaluation metrics for action recognition quality included classification accuracy, confusion matrix, and displacement error. The development of computer vision motion capture, models, and algorithms demonstrated promising applications in areas such as action technique recognition and sports performance analysis. Traditional machine learning algorithms like support vector machines and principal component analysis remain dominant in action recognition technology; however, in certain scenarios, the performance of deep learning algorithms surpassed that of traditional machine learning methods. The development of computer vision-based field camera setups, image feature extraction, and action recognition algorithm model requires a multidimensional assessment considering specific sports, application scenarios, and accuracy requirements. With the advancement of deep learning recognition algorithms and wearable wireless sensing technology, the precision, real-time capability, and robustness of unmarked motion capture are expected to further improve.",International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ipec61310.2024.00023?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ipec61310.2024.00023, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aimed to assess prevalence and trends of hypertension and its awareness, treatment, and control in Nepal. Methods We systematically searched CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest, PubMed, Web of Science, WorldCat, and government and health agency-owned websites to identify studies reporting prevalence of hypertension, awareness, treatment, and control in Nepal between 2000 and 2020. We applied the random-effects model to compute the pooled prevalence in the overall population and among subgroups in each 5-year interval period between 2000 and 2020. We used linear meta-regression analysis to predict hypertension from 2000 to 2025. Results We identified 23 studies having a total of 84,006 participants. The pooled prevalence of hypertension, awareness, treatment, and control for 2016–2020 was 32% (95% CI: 23–40%), 50% (95% CI: 30–69%), 27% (95% CI: 19–34%), and 38% (95% CI: 28–48%), respectively. The prevalence of hypertension varied by age, gender, education, and geographical area. Hypertension increased by 6 percentage points (pp), awareness increased by 12 pp, treatment increased by 11 pp, and control increased by 3 pp over the 20 years studied. Since 2000, the rate of increment of hypertension has been 3.5 pp per decade, where 44.7% of men are expected to suffer from hypertension by 2025. Conclusion The markedly increased prevalence of hypertension and relatively poor progress in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in Nepal suggest that there is a need for hypertension preventive approaches as well as strategies to optimize hypertension care cascade.",International Journal of Hypertension,2021.0,52,"{'url': 'https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ijhy/2021/6610649.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7952181, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fb78afd7821e691ba6d67bd0cff99de0e7569a77,"Designing, implementing and evaluating childbirth training protocol for undergraduate midwifery students with a computer and mobile application based on gamification method: study protocol","Background Clinical education plays a very important role in creating the necessary abilities and skills in the students of medical sciences. Any problem in clinical education complicates the patient safety and quality of health care delivery. In this regard, ""continuous evaluation"", ""educational innovation"", and ""participatory learning"" will contribute to more efficiency, and all the mentioned items can be implemented in gamification. The present study is to design, implement, and evaluate a childbirth protocol training application based on gamification in midwifery students. Methods This educational scholarship study will focus on all midwifery students entering Babol University of Medical Sciences in 2020 and 2021 during the second semester of the 2023–2024 academic year. The educational intervention will cover six childbirth protocol topics presented through gamification to two groups of midwifery students. Students will complete a demographic and Sibria Sherring's emotional intelligence questionnaire before the intervention, the childbirth protocol knowledge questionnaire and performance checklist at the mother’s bedside before and four weeks after the intervention, and the training method satisfaction questionnaire four months’ post-intervention. Data will be analyzed using SPSS 28 software with a significance level of less than 5%. Results This study will involve preparing, teaching, and evaluating six childbirth protocol topics through a game. It is assumed that the findings indicate that the educational method of gamification is better than the lecture method and by increasing the learning rate, the teaching process will be improved and the students will be fully satisfied with the teaching method. Discussion The effectiveness of the gamification method has been reported in various studies in the education of nurses, cardiopulmonary neurology for students, and health professions for medical students. Therefore, this approach can be effective in the delivery of protocol education for midwifery students. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Smart University of Medical Sciences (IR.SMUMS.REC.1402.029) and the study protocol was registered in the Iran Clinical Trial Registry (IRCT20180218038783N7).

595ed2b72aafc366a0330596c4b630c1a47791ef,MEASURING THE LONGITUDINAL IMPACT OF TEACHING PROGRAMMING ETHICS TO FIRST YEAR STUDENTS,"In the second semester of the academic year 2020-2021 (January to May 2021), a group of 175 first year computer science students in the School of Computer Science at Technological University Dublin, Ireland, were presented with four case studies on programming-related ethical scenarios, which was assessed using a combination of continuous assessment and examinations as part of the Erasmus+ Ethics4EU project (O’Sullivan and Gordon, 2020). The goal of these cases was not to tell the students the “correct answer” to an ethical dilemma but rather to get them to explore in groups and reflect personally on what they would do when presented with a particular scenario, analysing what they think is the right thing to do. The approach to teaching this content represented a shift of teaching paradigm from Behaviourist approach to a more Constructivist approach (Ling and Ling, 2016), which was supported by a three-part lesson structure - (i) teaching by lecturers, (ii) discussion in break-out room by groups of students, and (iii) sharing key ideas discussed using a chat tool and the Padlet notice board. Based on feedback from the students, they found the lessons extremely enjoyable and engaging and they felt the break-out rooms were essential in allowing them to see the content through others perspectives. In this follow-up study six months later, the students were asked to recall the content they could remember from the previous lessons as well as the key ideas they learned from those case studies. The outcomes were as expected, i.e., some students have almost no recollection of the case studies but remembered general ethical themes, whereas others had detailed recollection of both the content of the classes and the key ethical issues discussed. This supports Grosz’s notion of a “distributed pedagogy”, where ethics needs to be infused throughout the Computer Science curricula to remind students of some",INTED2022 Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21125/inted.2022.0273?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21125/inted.2022.0273, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

46fd480d4866c8081b668584ffa4c6bb07df92f5,A Bibliometric Analysis and Network Visualisation of Human Mobility Studies from 1990 to 2020: Emerging Trends and Future Research Directions,"Studies on human mobility have a long history with increasingly strong interdisciplinary connections across social science, environmental science, information and technology, computer science, engineering, and health science. However, what is lacking in the current research is a synthesis of the studies to identify the evolutional pathways and future research directions. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic review of human mobility-related studies published from 1990 to 2020. Drawing on the selected publications retrieved from the Web of Science, we provide a bibliometric analysis and network visualisation using CiteSpace and VOSviewer on the number of publications and year published, authors and their countries and afflictions, citations, topics, abstracts, keywords, and journals. Our findings show that human mobility-related studies have become increasingly interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional, which have been strengthened by the use of the so-called ‘big data’ from multiple sources, the development of computer technologies, the innovation of modelling approaches, and the novel applications in various areas. Based on our synthesis of the work by top cited authors we identify four directions for future research relating to data sources, modelling methods, applications, and technologies. We advocate for more in-depth research on human mobility using multi-source big data, improving modelling methods and integrating advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, and machine and deep learning to address real-world problems and contribute to social good.",Sustainability,2021.0,9,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/10/5372/pdf?version=1620817254', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.20944/PREPRINTS202103.0421.V1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.20944/PREPRINTS202103.0421.V1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5d984d34c0ddeb6e696d2b870926ab8976ee1f59,Building Teacher Community During a Summer of Crisis: STEAM Professional Development in 2020,": The GoSTEAM program promotes authentic integration of the arts into PreK-12 computer science, engineering, and invention instruction. STEM and arts teachers come together to form STEAM Innovation Teams in collaboration with university-based coaches and creative Innovators-in-Residence. Starting with a STEAM professional development summer institute and continuing throughout the year, the teams come together to design and implement novel STEAM lessons and initiatives in their schools that integrate learning goals from both the STEM and the art disciplines. This type of transdisciplinary collaboration between colleagues from vastly different fields is new to most teachers and presents unique challenges. A primary goal of the GoSTEAM professional development is therefore to create safe, interdisciplinary spaces where meaningful, cross-disciplinary collaborations can occur. In 2019, this was accomplished through an intensive, 120-hour face-to-face summer professional institute that incorporated many community building activities and collaborative planning sessions. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the summer institute changed to an online format and faced the challenge of providing teachers with a personally meaningful STEAM experience during a summer of crisis. Results show that the 2020 institute successfully supported the teachers, energized them, and provided them with tools to augment their virtual instruction.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted teaching in Kenya’s learning institutions, especially in medical schools, like Kenya medical training college (KMTC). Due to safety, face-to-face classes had to be suspended. Online learning tools played a crucial role during the pandemic; but in developing countries like Kenya, technological, educational/literacy background, and socioeconomic challenges existed that could be a hindrance to the adoption and utilization of online learning process. The purpose of this study was to identify challenges to online learning from the perspective of student nurses (March and September 2020 classes) at Kenya Medical Training College. The study objectives were to assess student-related, technological and institutional challenges to the utilization of online learning. A descriptive, cross-sectional design was utilised in the study. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data from sampled March and September 2020 class student nurses who undertook online classes. The respondents were 272 first-year diploma student nurses from March and September 2020 classes sampled from eight selected campuses in the Western, Nyanza, and North Rift regions of Kenya. Collected data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 computer software. Descriptive statistics included proportions, and frequencies, while results were presented in the form of graphs and tables. Ethical issues were observed by ensuring confidentiality and anonymity, and permission was sought prior to data collection. Study findings revealed the existence of challenges to the utilization of online learning by students at KMTC. Student-related challenges included knowledge gap on the use of internet infrastructure (38.8%), not owning E-learning devices (9.6%), and inadequate utilization of online learning at home setting due to disruptions, limited space, and competing tasks (88.2%). On technological challenges, 70% of respondents owned gadgets that were incompatible with the media that was being utilised for e-learning, hence couldn’t log in for the sessions. Frequent internet instability was experienced by 54.4% of students. 58.8% stated having slow internet connectivity that affected timely logging in for sessions. On institutional challenges, 55.5% of students stated inadequate preparation for online learning by the institutions, and lack of orientation. 92.6% of respondents indicated preference for face-to-face mode of learning to E-learning, citing reasons like poor communication between students and lecturers, interruption of online classes due to poor network, inconsistent data bundles, and lack of instant feedback and supervision by lecturers. In conclusion, great importance was attached to needs assessment survey for students and lecturers on all campuses to identify these challenges to enhance the adoption of the teaching model",East African Journal of Education Studies,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://journals.eanso.org/index.php/eajes/article/download/1846/2564', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.37284/eajes.7.1.1846?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.37284/eajes.7.1.1846, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

58e9e5bcc24ece48f4a7490277a389221c67370e,Engaging Black Female Students in a Year-Long Preparatory Experience for AP CS Principles,"In 2020, over 116,000 students took the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) Exam. Although Black female students have participated in AP CSP at higher rates than for the AP CSA course, their representation is still disproportionately lower than the school population of Black females. In this Experience Report, we present the early results of an NSF-sponsored effort that provides an AP CSP preparatory experience and CS career awareness to Black female students from rural, urban, and suburban communities in the state of Alabama. At the project's core is a peer-learning community (PLC) facilitated by Black female teachers with deep knowledge of AP CSP. An intensive summer experience prepares students for the AP CSP course through culturally-responsive, project-based learning experiences designed to connect advanced computing concepts to the students' personal lives and career aspirations. Interactions and support continue throughout the academic year to facilitate AP exam readiness. Online interactions among the PLC members serve to mitigate the barriers that young women of color typically encounter when pursuing CS education, increasing their persistence and success in CS. We examined whether students' project participation enhances self-efficacy and perceived competency in CS, increases positive attitudes, awareness, and desire to pursue CS studies and careers, and mitigates perceived socio-cultural barriers to pursue studies and careers in CS. Our initial findings include AP CSP examination qualifying rates (87.5%) that numerically exceeded the 2020 national/statewide rates for all groups (i.e., based on race, gender, and their intersection), increased perceptions of Black females as belonging in CS, and gains in computing self-efficacy.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2021.0,8,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3408877.3432560?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3432560, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3950577dbedc7179e8a7c01c54d3e0381d194a94,Enhancing Student Satisfaction through Emotion Detection and Recognition using Computer Vision with Predictive Analytics,"This study proposes an innovative method to enhance student satisfaction1 by integrating emotion detection2 and recognition using computer vision3 with visualization techniques4. Traditional methods like surveys often fail to capture the full scope of students' experiences. Our approach leverages real-time monitoring of students' emotional states to gain deeper insights into engagement and motivation, thereby improving overall satisfaction.

The objectives include developing a real-time emotion monitoring system, integrating facial API and computer vision for emotional recognition, using visualization techniques for data analysis, and assessing system effectiveness using the FURPS criteria. The study's significance spans various stakeholders: students benefit from improved academic outcomes, educators can tailor their teaching methods, parents can better support their children, and institutions can enhance their programs.

The research employs a quantitative descriptive design with participants from the computer science and digital animation programs, instructors, guidance counselors, and IT experts. Data will be collected through interviews, observations, and secondary sources. The project will be conducted over two semesters, with preliminary testing in the 2023-2024 academic year and full implementation in the 2024-2025 academic year.

Using the Agile Model for development, the system will feature a virtual YouCam web camera for emotion detection, visualization techniques for data analysis, and facial recognition for attendance monitoring.

Purpose
The purpose of this study is to fill a gap in literature with a meta-analysis of previous studies assessing the decision-making processes of travellers when choosing holiday destinations in times of crisis.


Design/methodology/approach
This study presents here an abductive analysis of the findings of 737 peer-reviewed studies published in leading hospitality and tourism journals between 1978 and 2020. The studies in question concentrate on tourist typologies and behaviours when making destination choices in times of crisis, and the garnered data was subjected to a computer-aided data analysis adopting a thematic analysis technique, making use of Leximancer software.


Findings
The data was subjected to a thematic analysis and clustered under five main categories based on the distribution of articles by publication year, research topic, author contributions, articles by journal and articles by country (e.g. tourist typology, travellers’ decision-making, holiday decision-making, tourist decision-making, destination choice, traveller behaviour and vacation decision-making).


Research limitations/implications
The limitations of this study include its inclusion only of articles listed in the SCOPUS, Web of Science and ScienceDirect databases. This study makes a critical assessment of the current gaps in literature and proposes questions to be raised in future studies.


Originality/value
This study proposes several topics for future investigation that are considered necessary to close crucial gaps in our understanding of the tourism sector’s response to behavioural trends. The authors’ intention in this regard is to increase the scholarly awareness of decision-making models relevant to destination choice by linking tourist typologies and the behaviour exhibited before, during and after crises.

 Nationally, more than one-third of students enrolling in introductory computer science programming courses (CS101) do not succeed. To improve student success rates, this research team used supervised machine learning to identify students who are “at-risk” of not succeeding in CS101 at a two-year public college. The resultant predictive model accurately identifies \(\approx\)99% of “at-risk” students in an out-of-sample test data set. The programming instructor piloted the use of the model’s predictive factors as early alert triggers to intervene with individualized outreach and support across three course sections of CS101 in fall 2020. The outcome of this pilot study was a 23% increase in student success and a 7.3 percentage point decrease in DFW rate. More importantly, this study identified academic, early alert triggers for CS101. Specifically, the first two graded programs are of paramount importance for student success in the course.",Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,2021.0,6,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.54364/aaiml.2022.1127', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1025335/v1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1025335/v1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In particular, the paper shows how the different envisaged scenarios have been perceived and applied by the teachers. Presented data clearly show the large adoption of the scenarios self-handled by the teachers with respect to costly and complex proctoring platforms, used only when numbers of students in a single exam are too large to be self-handled. © 15th International Conference e-Learning, EL 2021 - Held at the 15th Multi-Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2021.

Thus, this research aims to identify and analyze the dissertations and theses defended in the period between 1972 and 2020 which dealt with pedagogical practices about the teaching of MCP in High School (HS). The work seeks to highlight the innovations and pedagogical practices developed in the selected academic researches and the advances and obstacles faced when approaching MCP in HS, having the following research problem: what are the characteristics and theoretical-pedagogical tendencies of Modern and Contemporary Physics practices proposed in dissertations and theses aimed at Physics Teaching in high school? It is characterized as a state-of-the-art research on Brazilian academic production related to the proposed theme. 405 researches which approached the MCP theme were located from the Bank of Theses and Dissertations from the Documentation Center in Science Education in the School of Education of The University of Campinas (Unicamp). Of these, 162 papers which dealt specifically with the implementation of pedagogical practices in HS were selected. From the reading of the full texts of the 162 researches on pedagogical practices, we classified and analyzed the documents according to the following descriptors of Pedagogical practices, (School years, MCP Themes, MCP Content, Pedagogical Methods and Strategies, Teaching Materials, Theoretical Framework, Pedagogical Model). Among the 162 researches, we have identified that most of them have implemented practices in the 3rd year of HS, with the most covered topics being Quantum Physics and Nuclear Physics and, to a lesser extent, Solid State Physics. In relation to teaching methods and strategies, we identified: lectures, group work and prior knowledge elicitation more frequently. The most used Teaching Resources and Materials were the use of Internet/Computer/Digital Resources, Electronic Presentations,and Questionnaires/Exercises. As for the pedagogical models that supported the practices, the (Socio)Constructivist (44%) and Science-Technology-Society (38%) models prevailed, although we found practices consistent with the Traditional, Rediscover and Technicist models; furthermore, many studies involved two or more pedagogical models in the practices implemented. The results confirm the possibility of inserting MCP theme into HS, also evidencing the variety of theoretical and methodological options for the implementation of practices on the subject.",Investigações em Ensino de Ciências,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22600/1518-8795.ienci2024v29n3p349?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22600/1518-8795.ienci2024v29n3p349, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9d3db57aabe1d1284ad687aa3425ebfae61059db,Cardiac Rehabilitation: A Bibliometric Review From 2001 to 2020,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a serious threat to global public health due to its high prevalence and disability rate. Meanwhile, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has attracted increasing attention for its positive effects on the cardiovascular system. There is overwhelming evidence that CR for patients with CVD is effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To learn more about the development of CR, 5,567 papers about CR and related research were retrieved in the Web of Science Core Collection from 2001 to 2020. Then, these publications were scientometrically analyzed based on CiteSpace in terms of spatiotemporal distribution, author distribution, subject categories, topic distribution, and references. The results can be elaborated from three aspects. Firstly, the number of annual publications related to CR has increased year by year in general over the past two decades. Secondly, a co-occurrence analysis of the output countries and authors shows that a few developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and the UK are the most active in carrying out CR and where regional academic communities represented by Sherry Grace and Ross Arena were formed. Thirdly, an analysis of the subject categories and topic distribution of the papers reveals that CR is a typical interdiscipline with a wide range of disciplines involved, including clinical medicine, basic medicine, public health management, and sports science. The research topics cover the participants and implementers, components, and the objectives and requirements of CR. The current research hotspots are the three core modalities of CR, namely patient education, exercise training and mental support, as well as mobile health (mHealth) dependent on computer science. In conclusion, this work has provided some useful information for acquiring knowledge about CR, including identifying potential collaborators for researchers interested in CR, and discovering research trends and hot topics in CR, which can offer some guidance for more extensive and in-depth CR-related studies in the future.",Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,2021.0,33,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2021.672913/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8200471, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The current implementation of the virtual library model exploits the 3D features of the MaxWhere Seminar System. In our study we would like to summarize the classroom experiences that we brought together in teaching English as a second language for students of computer science majors at the Faculty of Informatics, University of Debrecen in the academic year of 2020 and 2021. Our main purpose was to improve the students’ linguistic knowledge and to collect their opinions and suggestions about the content of the learning material of our virtual library and where they think is necessary to modify it. Summarizing their views, we decided to add further vocabulary items, contexts and explanations to the material. In addition, their achievements proved that successful language learning needs carefully prepared tests and exercises which support self-assessment and increase motivation. In general, the more tests are available the more efficient the learning process is. But preparing good and varied tests manually is a relatively slow and exhausting work.

Here, we developed a novel numerical weather prediction (NWP) system at 100-m resolution updated every 30 seconds for precise prediction of individual convective clouds. This system was designed to fully take advantage of the phased array weather radar (PAWR) which observes reflectivity and Doppler velocity at 30-second frequency for 100 elevation angles at 100-m range resolution. By the end of the 5.5-year project period, we achieved less than 30-second computational time using the Japan&#8217;s flagship K computer, whose 10-petaflops performance was ranked #1 in the TOP500 list in 2011, for past cases with all input data such as boundary conditions and observation data being ready to use. The direct follow-on project started in April 2019 under the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) AIP (Advanced Intelligence Project) Acceleration Research. We continued the development to achieve real-time operations of this novel 30-second-update NWP system for demonstration at the time of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic games. The games were postponed, but the project achieved real-time demonstration of the 30-second-update NWP system at 500-m resolution using a powerful supercomputer called Oakforest-PACS operated jointly by the Tsukuba University and the University of Tokyo. The additional developments include parameter tuning for more accurate prediction and complete workflow to prepare all input data in real time, i.e., fast data transfer from the novel dual-polarization PAWR called MP-PAWR in Saitama University, and real-time nested-domain forecasts at 18-km, 6-km, and 1.5-km to provide lateral boundary conditions for the innermost 500-m-mesh domain. A real-time test was performed during July 31 and August 7, 2020 and resulted in the actual lead time of more than 27 minutes for 30-minute prediction with very few exceptions of extended delay. Past case experiments showed that this system could capture rapid intensification and decays of convective rains that occurred in the order of less than 10 minutes, while the JMA nowcasting did not predict the rapid changes by its design. This presentation will summarize the real-time demonstration during August 25 and September 7 when Tokyo 2020 Paralympic games were supposed to take place.</p>",,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5194/EGUSPHERE-EGU21-6890?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5194/EGUSPHERE-EGU21-6890, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8c275f425025a7a84ef380c5f0cb74bf7048e0b2,"""Functional Illiteracy: Barrier to the Sustainable Development of Romania – Republic of Moldova Cross-Border Area""","Amid computer science advancements, a major problem many states deal with is, paradoxically, functional illiteracy. This phenomenon accounts for socio-educational and economic problems of contemporary society that, if unsolved, in the medium and long term, can have serious effects on the future development of societies. The prevention and fight against functional illiteracy require specialized mobilization, on multiple sectors. On the PISA 2022 performance scale, the share of students with low performance in basic skills remains high, 42% for Romania and 44.3% for the Republic of Moldova (among the highest in the European Union). If the European Union is aiming to lower the functional illiteracy rate among 15-year-olds to below 15% by 2020, Romania and the Republic of Moldova are far from such an ambitious target. Both countries are aiming to lower this rate to 25% by 2030. In this context, a large part of future generations in the two countries are functionally and socially illiterate due to the lack of primary education, which will be a catastrophe for the labour market, businesses and economy in the future. We present a brief analysis of the functional illiteracy characteristics in Romania and in the Republic of Moldova among 15-year-old students. A comparative analysis of the functional illiteracy rates of students in the two countries, considering the PISA test in the period 2006–2022, was conducted, as well as of this phenomenon's effects on the future development of these countries, in general, and on the cross-border area, in particular.

1e6b393dc5edc5d2a8017816f44e30a0a8e7fc7d,Inculcating Multidisciplinary Learning in Electrical Engineering Undergraduate Curriculum through Problem-Based Learning,"Abstract— Recently, the multidisciplinary engineering education has been growing rapidly reflecting current technological concern. Engineering graduates from cross domains like mechanical engineering, computer science and engineering, electronics engineering in current market are in great demand. The National Education Policy NEP-2020 supports learning from multidiscipline in developing curriculum which is integrated and flexible in various learning environments. The goal of the multidisciplinary approach is to produce new age engineers who can become changemakers in dynamically changing industry. One such industry emerging rapidly in recent decades is the Electric Vehicles (EV). Students in the third year of undergraduate engineering from multiple disciplines take up an open elective on Electric Vehicles (EV) as a part of their curriculum. Multidisciplinary learning is essential for engineering students since sustainable transportation with EVs necessitates a thorough understanding across several engineering domains. Students from different educational backgrounds frequently encounter difficulties due to the lack of disciplinary knowledge as the EV course is multidisciplinary. To address all these issues, the study in this paper proposes a conceptual framework for designing an Electric Vehicle (EV) course by integrating with Problem-Based Learning (PBL). To provide the students with the multidisciplinary learning experience we present this paper as a case-study on how the engineering courses can be integrated with PBL.

This paper addresses this gender gap and proposes integrating programming into handicraft lessons to provide a creative activity for all students. The project was conducted in three Austrian schools over one year (2019–2020), involving 229 middle school students. The evaluation included questionnaires and the assessment of programmed and stitched designs to structure gender-sensitive workshops. While boys consistently reported higher scores than girls in interest, sense of belonging, and enjoyment, girls’ scores remained more stable. However, girls were significantly more likely to express pride in their final designs than boys, and overall, more girls completed individual designs as final products. These findings can be applied to interdisciplinary handicraft lessons in line with the Maker-Education movement to foster interest in programming.",International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET),2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3991/ijet.v19i06.48591?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3991/ijet.v19i06.48591, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4072ff40227050a9960f1d91f2a0a9e8a2df0044,Comprehensive three-phase bibliometric assessment on the blockchain (2012-2020),"PurposeThe research work provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on blockchain in general and with respect to trust and reputation management in particular. The research work also incorporates the research progress in Pakistan in the field of blockchain.Design/methodology/approachThe research study is conducted in three phases in which 9 different research questions are assessed for the time duration of 2012–2020 on a total of 9,314 published studies. The source of the research study is from one of the most prestigious databases, the Web of Science (WoS). The scholarly publication includes analysis on WoS categories, annual publication trends, types of documents, research areas, and collaboration network amongst countries, co-word analysis, top 10 countries and top 10 organizations with respect to research publications. The authors use VOSviewer tool to generate collaboration network of countries and co-occurrence network for co-word analysis. The connecting thread among the research question is the overarching research objective of exploring and understanding research out in blockchain. The authors have conducted the research in three phases. Phase 1 is planned to show various quantitative analysis of blockchain worldwide with respect to all 9 questions. In Phase II, prime importance is being given to the trust and reputation management aspect of blockchain. Phase III is concerned with the findings of 9 research questions with Pakistan as the ultimate focus.FindingsMajor findings include that China and the USA are the leading countries as they have contributed the most in research field of blockchain. Computer science emerged as the leading research area. The first research article dates back to 2013 with significant rise in publication trend over the last 4 years from 2017–2020. Trust management emerged as one of the key fields where blockchain plays a pivotal role. Pakistan occupies a position in top 20 countries with respect to research contribution. However, in order to rank amongst top 10 research countries, Pakistan needs rapid technological advancement. The immense rise in research publication trend in Pakistan from the year 2019–2020 as compared to prior 2019 era indicates that due focus is being given in the field of blockchain in Pakistan since the last two years.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors have considered WoS data source. Therefore, the study is limited to those published scholarly studies which are present in WoS database. More detailed assessment can be performed by analyzing other data resources. The authors have performed analysis based on 9 research questions. However, other parameters can also be included to perform more enhanced and detailed analysis. All types of documents are included in our research work including secondary studies also. However, some authors might not prefer to include all types of documents.Practical implicationsThe paper includes implications for the development of trust and reputation management area of blockchain.Originality/valueThe bibliometric analysis is worthy for scholars, researchers and students to help them make better decision in the field of blockchain with respect to various parameters.

1ef3720b7b52ec82e4bef357a9d786ba7034ad00,Correction to: Optical variability of quasars with 20-year photometric light curves,"We study the optical $gri$ photometric variability of a sample of 190 quasars within the SDSS Stripe 82 region that have long-term photometric coverage during $\sim 1998-2020$ with SDSS, PanSTARRS-1, the Dark Energy Survey, and dedicated follow-up monitoring with Blanco 4m/DECam. With on average $\sim 200$ nightly epochs per quasar per filter band, we improve the parameter constraints from a Damped Random Walk (DRW) model fit to the light curves over previous studies with 10-15 yr baselines and $\lesssim 100$ epochs. We find that the average damping timescale $\tau_{\rm DRW}$ continues to rise with increased baseline, reaching a median value of $\sim 750$ days ($g$ band) in the rest-frame of these quasars using the 20-yr light curves. Some quasars may have gradual, long-term trends in their light curves, suggesting that either the DRW fit requires very long baselines to converge, or that the underlying variability is more complex than a single DRW process for these quasars. Using a subset of quasars with better-constrained $\tau_{\rm DRW}$ (less than 20\% of the baseline), we confirm a weak wavelength dependence of $\tau_{\rm DRW}\propto \lambda^{0.51\pm0.20}$. We further quantify optical variability of these quasars over days to decades timescales using structure function (SF) and power spectrum density (PSD) analyses. The SF and PSD measurements qualitatively confirm the measured (hundreds of days) damping timescales from the DRW fits. However, the ensemble PSD is steeper than that of a DRW on timescales less than $\sim$ a month for these luminous quasars, and this second break point correlates with the longer DRW damping timescale.",Monthly notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,2022.0,22,"{'url': 'https://hal-insu.archives-ouvertes.fr/insu-03748242/file/stac1259.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'other-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02762, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A 2020 hiatus in water quality data tracking in the Lower Passaic River (LPR), New Jersey, has created a 5-year information gap. To gain insight into the LPR water quality status during this lag period and ahead, water quality indices computed with 16-year historical data available for 12 physical, chemical, nutrient, and microbiological parameters were used to predict water quality between 2020 and 2025 using seasonal autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) models. Average water quality ranged from good to very poor (34 ≤ µWQI ≤ 95), with noticeable spatial and seasonal variations detected in the historical and predicted data. Pollution source tracking with the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model yielded significant R2 values (0.9 < R2 ≤ 1) for the input parameters and revealed four major LPR pollution factors, i.e., combined sewer systems, surface runoff, tide-influenced sediment resuspension, and industrial wastewater with pollution contribution rates of 23–30.2% in the upstream and downstream study areas. Significant correlation of toxic metals, nutrients, and sewage indicators suggest similarities in their sources.

135f479835fbae27355a66c8b81c8d199f9bffc7,Online education of engineering students: Educational platforms and their influence on the level of academic performance,"The World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to considerable disruption of the global education system and required an early adaptation of the educational process. In addition to the resumption of the educational process, it was necessary to preserve the academic performance of students of higher educational institutions, including engineering ones. This study aims to develop a curriculum for engineering students to increase their level of success. Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (Ukraine) hosted the study. The sample consisted of 354 fourth-year students of the Engineering and Chemistry Faculty: 131 “Applied Mechanics”, 133 “Industrial Engineering”, and 151 “Automation and Computer-Integrated Technologies”. The sample included students of the Faculty of Computer Science and Computer Engineering: 121 “Software Engineering”, and 126 “Information Systems and Technologies” – 154 students from the 1st year and 60 students from the 2nd year. The study was conducted during 2019–2020. The data includes grades for in-line classes and final test scores. The result of the research has shown that modern digital tools such as Microsoft Teams, Google Classroom, Quizlet, YouTube, Skype, and Zoom, among others, have provided a highly effective educational process. The results of the educational process are as follows: 63 + 23 + 10 students received “Excellent/Perfect” (A) in 2019, 65 + 44 + 8 in 2020; 146 + 64 + 20 and 159 + 81 + 18 received “Good (B, C)”, respectively; 135 + 64 + 30 and 120 + 27 + 31 “Satisfactory” (D, E), respectively; – 10 + 3 + 0 and 10 + 2 + 3 “Unsatisfactory” (F), respectively. There was a tendency to increase the average score. The researchers found that the learning models were different before (offline) and during (online) the COVID-19 epidemic. However, the academic results of students were not different. The authors can conclude that e-learning (distance, online) is possible when training engineering students.

To achieve this, a sample of 321 first-year engineering students (107 females and 214 males) at a private university in northeast Mexico was analyzed during the 2020 academic year. Students were classified according to their gender, engineering program, and the development of their multiple intelligences according to Howard Gardner theory of multiple intelligences. To verify the effect of gender and program factors on the development of multiple intelligences, Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed with α = 0.05. The analysis of the effects of gender identified significant differences in four intelligences: linguistic and interpersonal (for which the female students obtained higher mean scores) and mathematical and visual (for which the male students obtained higher mean scores). The analysis of the effects of the engineering program identified significant differences in five intelligences: mathematical, visual, and musical (for which civil engineering students obtained a higher mean score than the students in the other programs); kinesthetic (for which computer science students obtained a lower mean score than students in the other programs); and naturalistic (for which sustainability engineering students obtained a higher mean score than students in the other programs).

d3abe4b0ab8e2e01c500f20ca89fa2adb5fdf660,[Modern approaches to studying child nutrition issues by students and doctors using digital interactive technologies].,"Digital interactive learning is spreading across many medical specialties, using a variety of methods: from problem-solving simulators to standardized patients, from computer modeling to mannequins. The purpose of the study was to analyze innovative approaches to independent work when studying issues of child nutrition by pediatric students and practicing doctors. Material and methods. The pediatric simulator, developed by the Higher School of Education and Science in collaboration with the teaching staff of seven medical universities in Russia, allows you to train and test students in conditions close to real ones, and to reinforce the issues of child nutrition. An analysis of the effectiveness of organizing online education among students (n=150, 15.7% boys, 85.3% girls, average age - 20.0±1.4 years; duration - February-May 2020) of the 3rd year of Sechenov and Smolensk Medical Universities was carried out using a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Using Google forms, the questionnaire was created with questions regarding the respondents' attitude towards distance learning. The effectiveness of distance learning on the studied simulator was analyzed for 84 students (n=48 - main group, n=36 - control group), a case analysis was carried out with the prescription of the diet therapy to a virtual patient with the lactase deficiency. Results. In two modes of the program (training and testing) the imitation of a dialogue with a virtual 3D patient, examination, diagnosis and treatment, including diet therapy were implemented. A number of diet therapy algorithms are presented in additional illustrations. The use of a children's simulator with a 10-point assessment system showed greater effectiveness in mastering practical skills in the main group compared to the control group. The students who mastered the digital simulator indicated satisfaction in acquiring new knowledge and skills, increased motivation to learn and gain practical skills in examination, supervision and prescription of the diet therapy, approaching 6-9 points (р=0.005). For the control group, the questionnaire showed consistently low results (p<0.05). Analysis of the prescription of the diet therapy in a situational task showed good and excellent results for all students of the main group. Conclusion. The interactive digital simulator has shown high efficiency in training future pediatricians.

The absence of treatment has motivated research in all fields to deal with it. In Computer Science, contributions mainly include the development of methods for the diagnosis, detection, and prediction of COVID-19 cases. Data science and Machine Learning (ML) are the most widely used techniques in this area. This paper presents an overview of more than 160 ML-based approaches developed to combat COVID-19. They come from various sources like Elsevier, Springer, ArXiv, MedRxiv, and IEEE Xplore. They are analyzed and classified into two categories: Supervised Learning-based approaches and Deep Learning-based ones. In each category, the employed ML algorithm is specified and a number of used parameters is given. The parameters set for each of the algorithms are gathered in different tables. They include the type of the addressed problem (detection, diagnosis, or detection), the type of the analyzed data (Text data, X-ray images, CT images, Time series, Clinical data,...) and the evaluated metrics (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1-Score, and AUC). The study discusses the collected information and provides a number of statistics drawing a picture about the state of the art. Results show that Deep Learning is used in 79% of cases where 65% of them are based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and 17% use Specialized CNN.

Also, currently, Incurable Killer Diseases including the physical and neurological diseases of our times such as Brain, and Breast, and Lung Cancer [4–6] and Cardiovascular [7, 8], Asthma, HIV/AIDS, Dementia (e.g. Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntingdon’s and Vascular etc.), MS (Multiple Sclerosis), MD (Muscular Dystrophy), Motor Neuron Disorders such as ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease) to name a few among others, were of primary interest. These diseases’ cures as of yet non-existent, however, are still meticulously being sought by the world’s prominent institutes of epidemiologic and vaccination research centers such as CDC in USA. The goal of this Special Issue was what the ongoing global trends are, why and how to avoid the unprecedented misery triggered by diseases and disorders, and specifically, the current pandemics (SARS-CoV-2). The IJCTE has also fully encouraged scientific methodologies (via software) and technologies (via hardware) in the realm of medicinal sciences, and received original contributions such as Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Bacteriology, Genomics, Pulmonology, and Obstetrics [9], Clinical Psychology, Applied Mathematical and Statistical Sciences (Operations Research, Data Mining, Sampling, Hypothesis Testing, Estimation, Empirical Bayesian, Safety and Reliability, Game Theoretic and Neural Network and Machine and Deep Learning frameworks...) and Immunology and similar, whereas also in peripheral real disciplines addressing the core issue of Pandemics’ and Incurable Killer Diseases’ Disaster Recognition, Mobilization and Remediation and Immunization, and post COVID-19 Recalibration efforts [10] but not limited to all above options. Overall, the academic interest and eagerness toward this noble and global goal (while a relentless challenge has been announced by all nations during their SOTU-State of the Union and similar addresses at their own lands proper towards discovering vaccines to eradicate these disastrous pandemics and incurable killer diseases by the middle of the 21 century) have been phenomenal. Out of many more competing papers submitted, the below listed ten contributions were peer-reviewed following countless hours of selfless efforts by scientists of all calibers, to whom the IJCTE Editorial Board and the Editors-in-Chief owe many thanks. Last but not the least, those contributions, not able to make the finish line, not necessarily were inadequate. However, due to the physical and digital space and time limitations, and the announced/extended deadline restrictions, they may not have been broken to print to the IJCTE’s regret. We sincerely encourage those authors to keep their academic attitude-defines-altitude motto for a future Special Issue to arrive shortly after a surprisingly original and calamitous pandemic has struck the globe in the year 2020.

e89403310fa6f7c429472361acafa038a3c84b0c,Audit of caesarean deliveries in ESUT Teaching Hospital (ESUTH) Enugu: A 3-year review,"Background: Caesarean delivery or abdominal delivery is a common intervention in current obstetric practice which has significantly reduced maternal and neonatal morbidities and mortality. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 1985 pegged the acceptable rate at 10-15% but the rate of caesarean sections has been increasing in both the developed and developing countries. However, the rates have been exceeded in many developed countries while in the developing countries with a lot of unmet needs, the rates are quite low. When absolutely indicated, the rate should not prevent the timely recourse to the procedure which is life-saving. Aim: The aim was to determine the rate of caesarean section in ESUT Teaching Hospital over t a 3-year period. Materials and Method: This was a retrospective study of all the caesarean sections done in ESUT Teaching Hospital Enugu from December 31, 2020 to January 1, 2018. The necessary data was collected from the registers of the theatre and labour ward of ESUT Teaching Hospital and patients’ case notes using a structured proforma. Statistical Analysis: Data collected from the study was analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) computer software for Windows version 20.0. Results were presented using simple percentages, frequencies and tables. Result: Out of the 4719 deliveries in the centre over the period, the caesarean rate was 29.6% out of which 73.7% were booked; 26.3% unbooked; 59.2% were emergencies and 40.8% elective. The major indications were previous caesarean 20.2%, hypertensive diseases in pregnancy 14.6% and poor progress of labour 11.4%. Maternal complications were PPH, 8.4%; UT injuries, 2.9% and maternal death, 0.5%. The neonatal intensive care admission was 2.49% and neonatal death, 8.5%. Conclusion: There is a relatively high caesarean section rate in ESUT Teaching Hospital when compared with the Nigerian national figures but this is still lower than what is obtainable in the developed countries.",World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0731.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30574/wjarr.2022.15.2.0731?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30574/wjarr.2022.15.2.0731, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

622ab3b54b7ab5297688bf5aa39825935223c812,Project based learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: Experiment reports of initiatives in computer engineering,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused profound impacts arising from a traditional on-site teaching model rupture and demanded distance learning for Engineering students, who faced additional challenges and opportunities for practical activities with physical components such as Internet of Things projects. As an alternative to standardized synchronous tests, Project Based Learning (PBL) was employed in this context to engage students in the social distancing context. This paper presents experiment reports of PBL application for the Polytechnic School of the University of Sao Paulo’s Computer Engineering curriculum in 2020: two undergraduate courses (third year’s Digital Laboratory II, fifth year’s Laboratory of Software Engineering II), scientific initiation (short-term research project of smart meter for third year student), and capstone project (one year project fifth year student regarding smart home monitoring). In all courses, at least a Master of Science student acted as co-advisor or graduate teaching assistant. When combined with remote labs, home labs and virtual labs, PBL could engage students and make practical activities happen during the pandemic. The students took an active part in the projects, working with stakeholders and raising demands for tools usage. © 2021 University of Minho.

This report details the clinical implementation of an MR simulation (MR-planning) program for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in one of North America's largest radiotherapy programs. Methods and materials An MR radiotherapy planning program was developed and implemented at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in 2016 with two dedicated wide-bore MR platforms (1.5 and 3.0 Tesla). Planning MR was sequentially implemented every 3 months for separate treatment sites, including the central nervous system (CNS), gynecologic (GYN), head and neck (HN), genitourinary (GU), gastrointestinal (GI), breast, and brachial plexus. Essential protocols and processes were detailed in this report, including clinical workflow, optimized MR-image acquisition protocols, MR-adapted patient setup, strategies to overcome risks and challenges, and an MR-planning quality assurance program. This study retrospectively reviewed simulation site data for all MR-planning sessions performed for EBRT over the past 5 years. Results From July 2016 to December 2021, 8798 MR-planning sessions were carried out, which corresponds to 25% of all computer tomography (CT) simulations (CT-planning) performed during the same period at our institution. There was a progressive rise from 80 MR-planning sessions in 2016 to 1126 in 2017, 1492 in 2018, 1824 in 2019, 2040 in 2020, and 2236 in 2021. As a result, the relative number of planning MR/CT increased from 3% of all planning sessions in 2016 to 36% in 2021. The most common site of MR-planning was CNS (49%), HN (13%), GYN (12%), GU (12%), and others (8%). Conclusion Detailed clinical processes and protocols of our MR-planning program were presented, which have been improved over more than 5 years of robust experience. Strategies to overcome risks and challenges in the implementation process are highlighted.

The participants were freshman students of Adama Science and Technology University in 2019/2020 academic year. The experimental group was treated with computer assisted task based listening skills instruction approach while conventional method was employed for control group. Teacher made tests and students’ self-reflection journal were the data collection instruments used in this study. For the analyses of numerical data, paired sample t-test and independent samples t-test were computed. Qualitative analyses were done for the data obtained through students’ self-reflection journal. Based on the findings, the proposed approach resulted in a strong and significant effect on students’ listening skills development. A statistically significant difference was confirmed between the experimental group and the control group in terms of their listening achievement score. The results of qualitative analyses depict that the majority of the students in computer assisted group showed positive feeling towards the approach; they also reflected that they relatively improved their listening skills. This implies that computer assisted task based listening skills learning approach appeared to facilitate individual learning, and increase students’ concentration. Thus, one can conclude that computer assisted task based listening skills learning approach facilitated students’ listening skills development than the conventional one.

Students, especially preservice teacher should have these useful skills for make next generation are more creative, struggling with the competition between human and computers, struggling with the world condition during and after pandemic strikes, and well prepared for their work field. Some of the learning approaches have been applied in the courses to construct their creativity, one of them, are STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) by the project.  This research’s aim is to investigate how is preservice science teacher’s creativity by the STEM based project learning before, during, and after pandemic covid-19. The method that is used is qualitative research by using class observation and quantitively count by creativity rubrics that includes creative thinking, behaviour, and products. This research is conducted in SETS learning (2nd semester in every year) by using STEM based project from the students of science preservice teacher year 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022. STEM based project learning could improve preservice science teacher’s creativity but it has differences for each class. Class 2019 has outperformed for creativity among others. While, class 2022 has less performed for creativity among others. Based on the observation, the covid-19 outbreak has high influence to this result because of the way of their learning in their high school before.

Setting One hundred and eighty countries’ patients with COVID-19 and fatality data representing the healthcare system preparedness and performance in combating the pandemic in 2020. Design Using the retrospective daily COVID-19 data in 2020 broken into 24 half-month periods, we applied unsupervised machine learning techniques, in particular, hierarchical clustering analysis to cluster countries into five groups within each period according to their cumulative COVID-19 fatality per day over the year and cumulative COVID-19 cases per million population per day over the half-month period. We used the average of the period scores to assign countries’ final scores for each measure. Primary outcome The primary outcomes are the COVID-19 cases and fatality grades in 2020. Results The United Arab Emirates and the USA with F in COVID-19 cases, achieved A or B in the fatality scores. Belgium and Sweden ranked F in both scores. Although no African country ranked F for COVID-19 cases, several African countries such as Gambia and Liberia had F for fatality scores. More developing countries ranked D and F in fatality than in COVID-19 case rankings. The classic epidemiological measures such as averages and rates have a relatively good correlation with our methodology, but past predictions failed to forecast the COVID-19 countries’ preparedness. Conclusion COVID-19 fatality can be a good proxy for countries’ resources and system’s resilience in managing the pandemic. These findings suggest that countries’ economic and sociopolitical factors may behave in a more complex way as were believed. To explore these complex epidemiological associations, models can benefit enormously by taking advantage of methods developed in computer science and machine learning.",BMJ Open,2021.0,13,"{'url': 'https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/11/11/e049844.full.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8578186, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fb33932819af4929dc972aa57a4d6c4a4678c4ee,Asynchronous Learning: Its Effects on Academic Performance and Students’ Motivation In Science,"The main purpose of the study is to determine the effect of asynchronous learning to academic performance and students’ motivation towards Science. It is necessary since motivation serves as a foundation for better understanding of science concepts in an asynchronous setting. The respondents are 201 grade 11 students of Iligan Computer Institute (ICI) who are enrolled during the Academic Year 2020-2021. The ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) model was used in the study for the development of asynchronous lesson on Genetic Engineering with Google Classroom as the online platform. The research utilized SMTSL (Students Motivation Towards Science Learning) questionnaire developed by Tuan, et al. (2005) composed of 35 questions encompassing six (6) domains of motivation namely, self-efficacy, active learning strategies, science learning value, performance goal, achievement goal and learning environment stimulation. Quantitative data together with qualitative analysis showed that students are moderately motivated towards science learning in an asynchronous environment. The highest identified domain is science learning value indicating that students find the relevance of science with daily life which makes them motivated to learn science even in a remote learning environment where there is no direct contact and supervision. In contrast, self-efficacy and performance goal are the least domains suggesting that students are least concerned with their own ability to perform well in science learning tasks and they do not compete with other students and get attention from the teacher. Using the researcher-made achievement test and performance task to measure their academic performance, 80% of the students belong to approaching proficiency, proficient and advanced groups showing that students did well in science in an asynchronous learning environment.  Moreover, students’ motivation was significantly correlated with science academic performance so science academic performance can be used as indirect evidence of students’ motivation. Based on these findings, it is recommended that curriculum experts and educators consider factors of motivation in revisiting the science curriculum in an asynchronous environment.",THABIEA : JOURNAL OF NATURAL SCIENCE TEACHING,2021.0,10,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.21043/thabiea.v4i1.9806', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21043/THABIEA.V4I1.9806?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21043/THABIEA.V4I1.9806, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ROAR is composed of three teaching units addressed to grades 10, 11, and 12, respectively. To improve students’ interest, motivation, and skills related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, ROAR integrates the teaching of mathematics and computer science through operations research. Its implementation started in 2021 in a grade 10 class at the scientific high school IIS Antonietti in Iseo (Brescia, Italy). We provided the details of the first two units in previous papers. Here, we focus on the third and last unit, carried out from October 2022 to January 2023, with the same students, then in a grade 12 class. Similarly to the first two units, we describe objectives, prerequisites, topics and methods, the organization of the lectures, digital technologies used, and a challenging final project that, this time, involved the manufacturer company Filtrec S.p.A. with a case. After analyzing the feedback from students, teachers, and practitioners engaged in the experimentation, we reflect on the entire experimentation and provide some insights to replicate a similar experience.

The instruction based videos help students to develop their hands on the new skills that are essential for their adaptability to new technologies. Handout is the guided document which contains the instructions to follow during the laboratory session to complete the problem statement given in the assignment. Assessment of their knowledge acquirement and skills is done through grading of assignments given to them. So in this article, VHDLISTE (Instructional Videos followed by Handout Learning – Implement, Submit, Test, and Evaluate) instructional strategy is designed and implemented for Tableau: A Visual Data Analytics Tool which is the part of the course Business Intelligence and Big Data Analytics of Final Year Computer Science and Engineering but is not covered in the syllabus. This VHDLISTE instructional strategy consists of six phases V- Instructional Videos, HDL- Handout Learning, I – Implement, S – Submit, T-Test, and E – Evaluate. In first phase V - Instructional Videos phase, students watch the instructional videos prepared by the instructor to get acquainted with the Tableau tool. In second phase HDL, students go through the lab handouts to read the instructions given for completing the lab assignment. In I – Implement phase, students implement the problem statement related to Tableau tool while test on covered topics is conducted in T-Test phase. In S – Submit, students submit the problem statement on institutional MOODLE. Instructor conducts the test on covered topic in T-Test phase. Instructor evaluates the problem statement as well as test submitted by students on institutional MOODLE in E – Evaluate phase.Learning objective (LOs) of this study is to teach the problem analysing and solving ability. These LOs are 1) Apply Filters on Dimensions and Measures for given dataset using Tableau (LO1) and 2) Apply K-means Clustering on given dataset in Tableau (LO2). The research question is - Whether the use of instructional strategy VHDLISTE is useful for learning the content beyond the curriculum? This activity is conducted for two Academic Years 2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022-23. The result of applying this strategy and perception of students are also explained. The result showed that this strategy improves the problem analysis as well as problem solving ability of students. Using t-test statistical analysis, it is found that there is significant difference in mean score between sample and overall population means for LO1 as well as LO2 for all these three years.

Clarke was awarded the A.M Turing Award in 2008 with his former student E. Allen Emerson and the French computer scientist Joseph Sifakis, for their work on model checking. “I’ve never liked to fly, although I’ve done my share of it. I wanted to do something that would make systems like airplanes safer,” Clarke said in a 2014 video produced by the Franklin Institute when he was awarded their 2014 Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science “For his leading role in the conception and development of techniques for automatically verifying the correctness of a broad array of computer systems, including those found in transportation, communications, and medicine.” Model checking is a practical approach for machine verification of mathematical models of hardware, software, communications protocols, and other complex computing systems. The technique is used to formally validate all of the states that a system can possibly reach, even when the number of states seems impossibly large—for example, more than the number of stars in the universe. These techniques, first developed when he was an assistant professor at Harvard University in 1981, are now widely used in the design of computing hardware and safety-critical systems and are increasingly being used for protocol validation and computer security. Clarke grew up in rural Virginia and was the first person in his family to graduate from college.

3045c52cd5bdd665f8fbd797c08a4e7db4d69b05,Analysis of the Development Trend in Forensic Odontology Based on CiteSpace.,"OBJECTIVES
To realize the dynamic visualization of forensic odontology based on the bibliometrics methods, and capture the research hotspots and identify the future development trend.


METHODS
Literature articles published from January 1995 to December 2020 were searched according to specific subject words in the core data set of Web of Science. The visualization analysis of publishing country, institution, discipline, author, co-cited journal and keywords was performed by CiteSpace 5.7.R5W software.


RESULTS
The annual analysis of publications showed an upward trend of forensic odontology research literature year by year, with the number of annual publications more than 110 in the last five years. Developed countries were the main source of contributions and the average centrality was greater than 0.2. The research of forensic odontology involved multiple disciplines, including stomatology, biology, computer science and medical imaging, with a distinct interdisciplinary feature. A total of 115 nodes were obtained by keyword cluster analysis. The principal line of forensic odontology mainly included individual identification and age estimation and the emergence of hotspots was closely related to new technologies. Population-based odontology investigation, improvement of traditional dental age estimation method and dental age estimation based on new technology were popular research in forensic odontology.


CONCLUSIONS
Developing countries urgently need to increase the focus on related research. It may be an important direction for the development of forensic odontology to establish and enrich the regional dental database, develop new odontology identification technology combined with frontier and high-end technology, and develop the identification program based on advanced information technology.",Fa yi xue za zhi,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.12116/j.issn.1004-5619.2021.210314?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.12116/j.issn.1004-5619.2021.210314, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8742d08a1590b9ffeb486e08bd72f6c4a6177ef5,20 Years of EPICS at Butler University: Experiences and Lessons Learned,"This research-to-practice full paper discusses experiences and lessons learned from our EPICS@BUTLER (Engineering Projects in Community Service at Butler) program. The program, housed within the department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, is part of a college of Liberal Arts and Sciences and serves a diverse population of students with multi-disciplinary backgrounds. The EPICS curriculum is driven by a team-based service-learning pedagogical model. EPICS teams learn how to work together effectively while addressing the immediate IT needs of our non-profit partner clients, navigating their budgetary restrictions, and coping with any lack of existing IT infrastructure. During the 2020/2021 academic year, we launched an empirical study to review and assess EPICS@BUTLER. The study's main goal was to learn from the past 20 years of running the EPICS program by soliciting input from all parties involved. We aimed to improve and expand our service-learning model within an LAS context. More specifically, this study included surveying alumni and current undergraduate students in order to understand the successes and areas of potential improvement within our program. In addition, we conducted one-on-one interviews with our community non-profit partners as well as volunteer team mentors to assess the program's effectiveness and community impact. Based on the empirical data we gathered and analyzed, we discuss how the existing curriculum is effective at providing fulfilling experiences which help our alumni secure jobs after graduation. In addition, we found that the practice of allowing supervised teams to navigate their own EPICS projects helps them improve their professional maturity and interpersonal skills. In summary, this paper discusses an empirical study and aims to leverage the results gathered from our surveys and interviews in order to present a plan for continuous improvement and modernization of our on-going EPICS program. In closing, our paper describes a concise roadmap and offers practical recommendations for implementing a similar EPICS program at other potentially interested academic institutions.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2023.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343064?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343064, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

947c613356246b4e67cc5c2f8cb3e29562d45b6b,"Twin-Width of Planar Graphs Is at Most 8, and at Most 6 When Bipartite Planar","Twin-width is a structural width parameter introduced by Bonnet, Kim, Thomassé and Watrigant [FOCS 2020]. Very briefly, its essence is a gradual reduction (a contraction sequence) of the given graph down to a single vertex while maintaining limited difference of neighbourhoods of the vertices, and it can be seen as widely generalizing several other traditional structural parameters. Having such a sequence at hand allows us to solve many otherwise hard problems efficiently. Graph classes of bounded twin-width, in which appropriate contraction sequences are efficiently constructible, are thus of interest in combinatorics and in computer science. However, we currently do not know in general how to obtain a witnessing contraction sequence of low width efficiently, and published upper bounds on the twin-width in non-trivial cases are often “astronomically large”. We focus on planar graphs, which are known to have bounded twin-width (already since the introduction of twin-width), but the first explicit “non-astronomical” upper bounds on the twin-width of planar graphs appeared just a year ago; namely the bound of at most 183 by Jacob and Pilipczuk [arXiv, January 2022], and 583 by Bonnet, Kwon and Wood [arXiv, February 2022]. Subsequent arXiv manuscripts in 2022 improved the bound down to 37 (Bekos et al.), 11 and 9 (both by Hliněný). We further elaborate on the approach used in the latter manuscripts, proving that the twin-width of every planar graph is at most 8, and construct a witnessing contraction sequence in linear time. Note that the currently best lower-bound planar example is of twin-width 7, by Král’ and Lamaison [arXiv, September 2022]. We also prove that the twin-width of every bipartite planar graph is at most 6, and again construct a witnessing contraction sequence in linear time.","International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming",2023.0,18,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2023.75?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2023.75, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5688d9df4ff710b2776f33f636e993c658854453,A machine learning enabled affective E-learning system model,"The purpose of this study is to propose an e-learning system model for learning content personalisation based on students’ emotions. The proposed system collects learners’ brainwaves using a portable Electroencephalogram and processes them via a supervised machine learning algorithm, named K-nearest neighbours (KNN), to recognise real-time emotional status. Besides, it uses a reinforcement learning approach to analyse the learners’ emotional states and automatically recommend the best-fitted content that keeps the students in a positive mood. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in two forms: 1) the system performance and 2) student engagement, satisfaction, and learning. A convenience sampling method is used to select 30 students from the pollution of 281 PartII-undergraduate students who study computer science during the 2020-21 academic year at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. The selected students are divided into homogenous control and experimental groups for learning English listening and reading skills. According to the machine learning results, the trained KNN recognises the emotional states with an accuracy of 74.3%, the precision of 70.8%, and recall of 69.3%. In addition, the results of the t-Test demonstrate that the proposed e-learning system model has no significant impact on learners’ learning and engagement but enhances the student’s satisfaction compared to traditional e-learning systems (p < 0.05).",Education and Information Technologies : Official Journal of the IFIP technical committee on Education,2022.0,17,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10639-022-11010-x.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8984673, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It received particular attention after the worldwide spread of COVID-19 pandemic. The current study attempted to probe the medical sciences EAP instructors’ attitudes towards implementing CALL in teaching English to the students of medical sciences. The study further tried to inquire into the barriers to the implementation of online EAP classes for the students of medical sciences within the pandemic period. 
Methods: Taking a mixed-method research design, the questionnaire and interview were used to gather the required data. Eighty EAP instructors completed the questionnaire and 25 instructors answered the interview questions. The participants were teaching English to the medical sciences students in Iranian state universities of medical sciences in Tehran, Yazd, Tabriz, and Mashhad in the academic year 2019-2020. Mean values were used to illustrate the results of the questionnaire items and interview responses were scrutinized to extract the constituent themes. 
Results: The results revealed that the medical sciences EAP instructors held positive attitudes towards the use of technology in their classes. Indeed, the mean values ranged from 3.16 to 4.79, which indicated the instructors’ positive inclination towards implementing CALL in EAP classes.They also pointed to the existing barriers to the successful implementation of CALL and the challenges they encounter in online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic period. 
Conclusions: The findings highlighted the significance of revisiting the role of technology in EAP curriculum for medical sciences students. In this regard, the results carry implications for the policymakers, material developers, and instructors in universities of medical sciences.",,2021.0,4,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22038/FMEJ.2021.53412.1367?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22038/FMEJ.2021.53412.1367, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Investigating the origins and mechanisms of land-use change is essential. The results show that earlier land-use models, which also lacked simulation studies and projections of land-use changes in Shaanxi Province over a 20-year timeframe, find it difficult to integrate quantitative and spatial pattern forecasts. This paper uses the patch-generating land usage simulation (PLUS) model to assess Shaanxi Province's land use patterns between 2000 and 2020 and predict land usage for the year 2025.Farmland, woodlands, and grassland are the three main land types that make up most of the Shaanxi Province's total area. Forests make up most of the land that will be transferred between 2000 and 2020, while agriculture makes up most of the land that will be transferred. Most of the elements influencing the spread of all land use types were rainfall and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

The question then was whether American branches could be effectively grafted on a Soviet tree planted in a Chinese garden (Pepper, S. 1990. China's Education Reform. Berkeley). We will try to demonstrate that in 2023 that China succeeded in implanting Western HE successfully in its education system. Why so many Chinese students study in the United States. In 2003 only 57,717 HE international students studied in China. During the 2020-21 school year, 317,299 Chinese nationals enrolled in US institutions, represented about a third of all international students studying in the USA. For these Chinese students—mostly in maths, computer science and engineering—the most important was to get an “American degree” (SCMP 15.11.2022). An important question in 2021-2022 is the worst recession since the Great Depression caused by the pandemic Covid-19 which perturbated also education and the number of Chinese students studying in America. Chinese students in the US, in particular, found themselves vulnerable. The USA, Australia, and the UK are the most popular destinations, receiving 33 percent of China’s HE international students. In the first six months of 2022, the US issued 31,055 F-1 visas to Chinese nationals, down from 64,261 for the same period in 2019, consequently the number of Chinese HE students going abroad is at present falling sharply.

43cb11482c23bdd9d6283ed73cd8b86395e56338,Developing a photography‐based harvest survey to estimate age and subspecies composition of midcontinent sandhill cranes,"Midcontinent sandhill cranes (Antigone canadensis) are managed as a single population, but hunting regulations are structured so harvest is targeted towards the more numerous lesser sandhill cranes (A. c. canadensis). However, research indicates that greater sandhill cranes (A. c. tabida) have been disproportionally exposed to harvest at a rate exceeding their proportion within the midcontinent population. In addition, harvest has increased 22% per year in the U.S. Central Flyway states. The midcontinent population appears to be growing in recent years, but variability in annual abundance estimates has increased substantially. With limited resources and harvest management uncertainty increasing, we developed methods for a citizen science, photography‐based harvest survey to estimate age and subspecies composition of harvested midcontinent sandhill cranes. To develop survey methods, we collected physical parts from 284 sandhill cranes in North Dakota in 2019 and 2020. We manually measured the culmen and tarsus using calipers, and digitally measured these parts using photographs and computer software. All digitally derived measurements were 2.5% to 5.9% larger than manual measurements; therefore, we developed linear models that adjusted digital measurements, facilitating subspecies prediction using an existing morphometric‐based technique. In 2021, we requested an equal number of hunters to participate using 2 data collection methods to test if hunters could reliably take photographs suitable for digital measurement. Collection method 1 involved photographing the head and leg simultaneously, and Collection method 2 involved photographing the head only. Hunters submitted a total of 239 photographs. Only 80 of these photographs were submitted using Collection method 1, and 72% were suitable for digital measurement. Conversely, hunters submitted twice as many photographs using Collection method 2, and 88% of these photographs were deemed suitable. Although obtaining the tarsus measurement slightly improved subspecies predictability, Collection method 2 increased participation and usable data. We believe our results could be used to develop an operational survey of age and subspecies composition of midcontinent sandhill cranes, wherein a sample of crane hunters throughout the midcontinent population range would be asked to electronically submit a photograph of the head of each bird they harvest. A time series of age and subspecies composition of this population would provide managers with valuable information and improve harvest management at minimal additional cost and burden, compared to a traditional parts collection survey administered by mail.",Wildlife Society bulletin,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/wsb.1512', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/wsb.1512?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/wsb.1512, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

50c720b7f85a3987b9410ff56e4c366b5c493a28,The history of UK weather forecasting: the changing role of the central guidance forecaster. Part 1: the pre‐computer era,"We take much for granted in current-day weather forecasts – for example, we accept as normal that major changes in weather regime can be predicted with relative confidence a week or more ahead. In addition, we have come to expect accurate shortperiod predictions for our local area. But this was not always so – the current capabilities were only achieved through cumulative/incremental improvements over the decades, alternating between periods of stagnation and other periods of more rapid progress. This has been described by Bauer et al. (2015) as a ‘quiet revolution’ and that ‘the impact of NWP is one of the greatest of any area of physical science’. Several studies have reviewed how numerical weather prediction (NWP) has advanced during the computer age (e.g. Hinds, 1981; Golding et al., 2004; Persson, 2005). Here, in the first part of a new series of papers, we tell the story of how weather forecasting has evolved, highlighting the importance of the forecaster in the chain and how the skill sets required by the forecaster have also changed fundamentally through this time. A chronological sequence is followed, though the divisions between the epochs are necessarily blurred. Examples are carefully selected to illustrate the capabilities of weather forecasting from an age prior to that of the computer, right through to the modern era, particularly in terms of frontal and cyclonic scenarios but we also include inherently less well defined and sometimes more complex, challenging situations. We bring out the uniquely human (as opposed to computer) skills that remain essential to this day in all aspects of weather forecasting. Compared with the purely subjective approach in the first two-thirds of the last century, the present-day forecaster, by contrast, has access to a huge range of sometimes conflicting NWP products, which have to be evaluated to produce a forecast. To set the context, Figure 1 shows the relative performance of the principal Met Office operational model at various forecast ranges through over 50 years of progress from 1967 to 2020. The overarching message from Figure 1 is that 5-day ahead forecasts now are as accurate as 1-day forecasts in the very early computer age. Much of the information for this study has been drawn from contemporary sources. Met Office National Archive Day (whereby a selection of the working Central Forecasting Office (CFO) charts on 15 January each year from 1960 to 1993 were retained) provided a rich source or material. For the most recent 30–40 year period, most examples will be drawn from events within the authors’ direct forecasting experience.",Weather,2022.0,9,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/wea.4217?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/wea.4217, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This was said repeatedly, but is certainly the right name for the 2020 edition of the Joint Varenna-Lausanne International Workshop on the Theory of Fusion Plasmas. After it became clear that Covid-19 was not going to give up easily, the conference was postponed from August to October 12-16 and the venue was changed too. The conference finally took place in the cosy Starling Hotel in Lausanne. The format was hybrid, a mix of face-to-face and remote participation. This was the result of tremendous efforts from the organisers, who had to adapt on a day-to-day basis in a context of fast evolving health situation. We believe the result was up to the dedication. Discussions were lively thanks to a very high quality of presentations and a relatively large audience, although the attendance was slightly reduced due to the circumstances. The hybrid format was really a plus. It allowed a rich mixture of exchanges on site and remote discussions by teleconference. Poster sessions by videoconferencing were a real success, including group participation and chats - the massive participation of young (and less young) Swiss scientists on site was surely appreciated. So once again, theory was innovative! MHD was in the limelight, covering all hot topics at stake in present and future fusion devices: disruptions, Edge Localised Modes, error fields and Resonant Magnetic Perturbations, Neoclassical Tearing Modes, magnetic configuration with negative triangularity, kinetic MHD, and last but not the least, 3D magnetic equilibria with applications to tokamaks and stellarators. This was a firework of theoretical and numerical results. Turbulent transport was on the forefront too, with some focus this year on plasma edge issues, turbulence self-organisation and transport in stellarators. Finally, special attention was given to impurity transport, in line with a continued interest in metallic walls. Mathematics and computer sciences applied to numerical simulations for plasma physics are traditionally lively topics of the conference, and indeed, outstanding results were presented both in fluid and kinetic computing.

The sample group consisted of 4th-year students who were studying in the departments of ‘Computer and Instructional Technologies Education’, ‘Classroom Teaching’, ‘Art Teaching’, ‘Mathematics Teaching’, ‘Turkish Teaching’, ‘Social Studies Teaching’, ‘Preschool Teaching’, and ‘Science Education’, under the body of Faculty of Education, Fırat University during the 2019–2020 academic year. The “Cognitive Flexibility Scale”, which was developed by Martin and Rubin (1995) and adapted into Turkish by Çelikkaleli (2014), and “Teachers’ Sense of Efficacy Scale,” which was developed by Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk Hoy (2001) and adapted into Turkish by Çapa, Çakıroğlu and Sarıkaya (2005), were used as data collection tools in the study. The data were analysed using a computer-aided statistical program. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to meet the normality assumption of the data. Since the data met the assumption of normality, independent samples t-test was used to compare student views according to the variable of gender. Analysis of variance was used to make comparison based on the variables of department, grade point average and expectation to pass PPSE (Public Personnel Selection Examination). Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to determine the correlation between the scales. As a result of the study, both the cognitive flexibility levels and the levels of teaching self-efficacy perception were found to be high in preservice teachers. While the cognitive flexibility level of female preservice teachers was higher than male preservice teachers, the cognitive flexibility levels and teaching self-efficacy perceptions were higher than others in preservice teachers having a high grade point average and a high expectation to pass PPSE. Finally, it was determined that levels of cognitive flexibility and teaching self-efficacy perception affected one another positively and significantly.",Discourse and Communication for Sustainable Education,2023.0,5,"{'url': 'https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/dcse-2023-0004', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2478/dcse-2023-0004?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2478/dcse-2023-0004, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ISBN: 978-1-13-830438-3.","Our bodies have becomemore digital over the past year or so than they were before 2020. Through multiple national lockdowns and international travel restrictions, we have all had to project our bodies through digital technology. The possibilities for creative engagement with technology have become far more broadly evident than they have been for the past three decades. This book was written in the years immediately before all this, at a time when we had already starting thinking and talking about the post-digital. This was a response, for some, to what comes after the posthuman cyborg popularized in academic discourse by Donna Haraway and other since the 1980s. Digital Bodies has four sections, each one grouping four chapters around a specific theme. The first of these groups is around the performing body, offering contributions by academics who have engaged with this topic for quite some time – Susan Broadhurst, Johannes Birringer, Dani Ploeger, and Maria Chatzichristodoulou. Taken together, their essays supplement SteveDixon’sDigital Performance quasi-canonical book from 2005 with more up-todate examples of creative projects associated with contemporary themes like recycling and privacy. The second section contains new writings by a small number of scholars ofHumanComputer Interaction design. Even so, the topics covered here are perennials in HCI studies: presence, embodiment, mediated emotions, and tactile perception. As collaborative computing specialist Steve Benford puts it in the foreword to this same book, HCI scholars frequently see the human body as ‘a key frontier for creating powerful and deeply engaging ways of interacting with computers’. Reading through the essays presented here, it is very evident that the authors – Michaela French, Helga Schmid, Caroline Yan Zhang, and Laura Ferrarello – concur fully. The remaining two parts of the book deal with creativity in fashion design and meaning making in the social sciences. Douglas Aitkinson discusses ‘post-industrial’ fashion, while Kat Theil considers fashion without products. Camille Baker proposes critical interventions inwearable tech, going beyond ideas of digital prosthetics that have circulated since at least the 1980s, whereas digital fashion tools are taken into consideration by Bruna Petreca, engaging, once again, with the fast-evolvingHCI topic of tactile perception. The final four essays in this collection provide a plethora of topics in which any performance studies enthusiastwillfind something of interest, going from Anna Xambó’s creative design synergies betweenmusic andHCI to digital museum installation creative engagements by the book’s coeditor Sara Price. Caroline Pelletier and Roger Kneebone take a playful perspective on medical simulation, in contrast with Carey Jewitt’s rumination on methodological innovation within areas touched uponmore thanonce inotherpartsof thispublication. All in all, this book provides both an excellent update for scholars interested in contemporary creativity and technology in the arts and humanities and a current introduction to the subjectmatter as it stood right before digital bodies found a wider online world in which to roam with the onset of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. toni sant",New Theatre Quarterly,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/S0266464X21000208?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266464X21000208, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

56d557fadbd464dcaa7c65f658f195e67538c7dc,"Computer Vision Syndrome Among Medical and Engineering Students, Rupandehi, Nepal","INTRODUCTIONComputers and laptops have become an integral part of our daily life. We interact with computer screens for minutes to hours depending upon our need, for entertainment or official purposes. Using computers has become a 21st century necessity. The expansion of information technologies in recent decades has resulted in increased use of video display terminals (VDT) in the workplace.  The American Optometric Association (AOA) defines Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) as the complex of eye and vision problems related to near work, which are experienced during or related to computer use. CVS is characterised by visual symptoms resulting from interaction with a computer display or its environment. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of computer vision syndrome among medical and engineering students of Rupandehi, Nepal.
MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross‑sectional study was conducted among final year medical and engineering college students of Universal College of medical sciences and Lumbini Engineering college, Rupandehi, Nepal. Sixty-three students were included in the study based on inclusion/exclusion criteria in one-month period (from 1st September 2020- 30th September 2020. The participants were surveyed using a validated structured questionnaire and the data were analysed using SPSS software version 20.0.
RESULTS Out of total 63 respondents (32 medical students and 31 engineering students), more than half (60.32%) were male. Majority of the respondents (73.01%) had ocular symptoms of CVS among medical and engineering students. Among medical and engineering students the most common symptoms were redness, which was present in 51 (80.95%) of the students, followed by foreign body sensation present in 48(76.19%) and itching in 45(71.43%) of the students.
CONCLUSION This study concludes that more than half of the students complained of any one of the symptoms of CVS. Although CVS has not been found to cause any permanent damage to the eyes, yet it’s painful symptoms can affect the performance.",Journal of Universal College of Medical Sciences,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JUCMS/article/download/47248/35393', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3126/jucms.v10i01.47248?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3126/jucms.v10i01.47248, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f2ff46f13f6707be0295e1d6f6d00df9f3d4ce86,Ethics and Creativity in Computer Vision,"This paper offers a retrospective of what we learnt from organizing the workshop Ethical Considerations in Creative applications of Computer Vision at CVPR 2021 conference and, prior to that, a series of workshops on Computer Vision for Fashion, Art and Design at ECCV 2018, ICCV 2019, and CVPR 2020. We hope this reflection will bring artists and machine learning researchers into conversation around the ethical and social dimensions of creative applications of computer vision. 1 CVFAD: Computer Vision for Fashion, Art and Design In 2018, we organized, in conjuction with ECCV, the first workshop on Computer Vision for Fashion, Art and Design. The workshop concentrated on generating, analyzing and processing visual content and invited the computer vision community to use generative model as a tool. As part of this workshop, we organized the Fashion-Gen [4] challenge for language to visual fashion design. The workshop also included a Computer Vision Art Gallery, organized by Luba Elliot and Xavier Snelgrove, to reflect the growing community of digital artists. Overall, the workshop brought together researchers in computer vision, artists and professionals from creative domains to discuss open problems in the areas of computer vision for fashion and creative visual content generation. Our ICCV 2019 and CVPR 2020 workshops broadened the scope of focus to include economical and industrial applications of creative computer vision tools. We hosted two fashion oriented challenges, FashionIQ [8] on multimodal fashion image retrieval [8] by Wu et al and DeepFashion2 [1] on a variety of fashion and clothing tasks such as fashion landmark detection by Ge et al. In ICCV 2019, Adriana Kovashka [7] brought up discussions on biases in creative advertisement content creation, and in political campaigns. We also had discussions during the panel discussions on potential harms that can be created by lack of representation in fashion industry and datasets. 2 EC3V: Ethical Considerations in Creative Applications of Computer Vision In 2021, we organized, in conjunction with CVPR, the first workshop on Ethical Considerations in Creative applications of Computer Vision (E3CV) . This workshop built upon 3 years of prior workshop organizing experience — 4 creativity-oriented challenges, as well as a successful Creativity in AI workshop series at NeurIPS and multiple generative art symposiums at the intersection of machine learning research and fashion industry — and oriented our focus around the under-explored ethical dimensions of creative computer vision work. With this workshop, we brought together a team of computer vision researchers, artists, and sociotechnical researchers to address growing number of questions on broader impact of this research. At a high level, the workshop focused on (a) the recognition of creative computer vision technologies as a new form of art , (b) influence of these technologies on society and representations [2] and (c) the areas that requires greater attention and discussion, and can create potential harms [3, 5]. 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021), Sydney, Australia. We also hosted the Computer Vision Art Gallery this year to bring more artists as one of the major stakeholders to the discussion. The computer vision art gallery showcased the work of 60+ artists addressing a range of topics and leveraging range of computer vision methods. For example, Jake Elwes’s work ‘Zizi and Me’ 11 showcased a double act between drag queen Me and a deep fake clone of Me. In doing so, the work aims to both demystify AI and queer the process of AI development. Nouf Aljowaysir’s project, ‘Salaf’, leveraged generative techniques to make visible the patterns of inclusion and exclusion operative in AI systems and express her personal frustrations with the Western colonial gaze so frequently embedded within the systems in use today. Many fruitful conversations came out of the workshop including the oral presentation 14 by Prabhu and Isiain [3] critiquing our implementation of art gallery and submission process. Two main anchors that covered major conversations during our breakout sessions were around cultural appropriation, and ownership as well as issues integrated in training data. Cultural appropriation vs inspiration Algorithmic techniques offer new routes for adopting and transferring aesthetic styles in ways that can be beautiful and creative and even shed light on cultures and art that individuals might not otherwise engage with. However, these same tools risk enabling new forms of cultural appropriation as they can make it even easier to extract from marginalized cultures without any accompanying investment in that culture, understanding of the significance of the artefact or aesthetics, or meaningful engagement with or say from the community. Cultural appropriation [2], distributed art and eventually generative art, all raise once again the question of intellectual property. If a traditional African pattern is re-contextualised in western fashion, is it fair to share the profit? If an artwork is the result of millions of people interacting with a website, should everyone get a fraction of the credit? The question becomes more complex when considering techniques based on deep learning, where a model is trained by exposure to thousands of images. These models can later be deployed by artists as aid to the creative process. How much credit goes to the ideator of the algorithm in this case? And how much to the creators of the content that was used to create the content? While ethical considerations for what concerns the work of a specific artist are starting to be discussed in depth, the aspect of broader cultural appropriation is still relatively unexplored. Fundamental challenges arise when trying to define ownership and copyrights in the context of Traditional Cultural Expression, where the intellectual contribution can’t be attributed to a single individual, but results from, and often defines, the cultural evolution of specific groups of people. Generative art, training data: a source of inspiration or memorization? The ever-increasing ability of AI models to generate very realistic images introduces new challenges. AI-generated content can be carefully tailored to specific generations, creating (supposedly) new content that resembles the training data. Considerations related to the training data are: biases inherently present in the data, memorization of training data, and insufficient transparency around some dataset creation processes [5]. When using models trained on specific datasets to generate art, any bias present in the training data is unavoidably learned by the model and revealed in its generations [6]. Many contemporary artists have begun to engage with ML researchers to find these biases. Some have done this for the visual aesthetics that the techniques begin to allow, others engage with them more critically in order to understand and reveal the algorithmic processes that are beginning to have great social and political power. These groups often notice the social dimension of the algorithms which can be overlooked by the computer science community.",arXiv.org,2021.0,19,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03111, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Among the greenhouse gases emitted by various sources, carbon dioxide contributes largely to the emission. In this study, the entity-level greenhouse gas emission of the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines-Oroquieta for Year 2020 was estimated following the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Based on the results, emission from mobile combustion sources was estimated to be 0.0895 tCO2e while emission from stationary combustion sources was 0.139 tCO2e yielding a total GHG emission for Scope 1 of 0.2285 tCO2e. Moreover, the electricity consumption of the campus which corresponds to the Scope 2 emission yielded 24.7135 tCO2 constitutes largely to the overall greenhouse gas emission.

6c94fddc464e45bc2dee4573cfa980dc71ca6ca4,Trends of research productivity across author gender and research fields: A multidisciplinary and multi-country observational study,"Bibliographic properties of more than 75 million scholarly articles, are examined and trends in overall research productivity are analysed as a function of research field (over the period of 1970–2020) and author gender (over the period of 2006–2020). Potential disruptive effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are also investigated. Over the last decade (2010–2020), the annual number of publications have invariably increased every year with the largest relative increase in a single year happening in 2019 (more than 6% relative growth). But this momentum was interrupted in 2020. Trends show that Environmental Sciences and Engineering Environmental have been the fastest growing research fields. The disruption in patterns of scholarly publication due to the Covid-19 pandemic was unevenly distributed across fields, with Computer Science, Engineering and Social Science enduring the most notable declines. The overall trends of male and female productivity indicate that, in terms of absolute number of publications, the gender gap does not seem to be closing in any country. The trends in absolute gap between male and female authors is either parallel (e.g., Canada, Australia, England, USA) or widening (e.g., majority of countries, particularly Middle Eastern countries). In terms of the ratio of female to male productivity, however, the gap is narrowing almost invariably, though at markedly different rates across countries. While some countries are nearing a ratio of .7 and are well on track for a 0.9 female to male productivity ratio, our estimates show that certain countries (particularly across the Middle East) will not reach such targets within the next 100 years. Without interventional policies, a significant gap will continue to exist in such countries. The decrease or increase in research productivity during the first year of the pandemic, in contrast to trends established before 2020, was generally parallel for male and female authors. There has been no substantial gender difference in the disruption due to the pandemic. However, opposite trends were found in a few cases. It was observed that, in some countries (e.g., The Netherlands, The United States and Germany), male productivity has been more negatively affected by the pandemic. Overall, female research productivity seems to have been more resilient to the disruptive effect of Covid-19 pandemic, although the momentum of female researchers has been negatively affected in a comparable manner to that of males.",PLoS ONE,2022.0,10,"{'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0271998&type=printable', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9365186, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

According to several studies, in 2025 this number will rise to 8 million (Altbach & Bassett, 2004; Eustace, 2007; Fischer, 2009). Meanwhile, the number of international graduate students attending U.S. universities in 2014 reached 329,854 representing 37% of all international students in the country (IIE, 2014), and continued to increase through fall 2010, with all of the increase occurring in Science and Engineering (SE in 2011, foreign students earned 56% of doctorates in engineering, 51% in computer science, and 44% in physics (National Science Board, 2014).As described in Allum's (2014) report based on the annual Survey of Graduate Enrollment and Degrees, in the fall of 2013, 56.2% of all foreign graduate students were in engineering, mathematics and computer science, physical and earth sciences, or biological and agricultural sciences. Meanwhile, only 17.6% of U.S. citizen and permanent resident graduate students were enrolled in these fields. This trend has continued unabated showing that the United States receives a considerable number of international graduate students, who are preferentially enrolled in SE National Academy of Sciences, 2006). The growing demand for scientists and engineers is a worldwide phenomenon and many developed countries that cannot meet this increased demand locally, recruit international students and foreign-born highly educated workers who are likely to bring a significant contribution to the higher education system and workplaces. Despite the magnitude of the international SE Mori, 2000). By gaining an understanding of these issues, American higher education institutions could proactively formulate appropriate policies and programs that would benefit international students and in long term would contribute to recruit, train, and retain talented specialists in science and engineering fields.This paper examines the relationship between post-graduation plans and the graduate school experiences of S&E doctoral students when controlling for demographic factors (age, sex), culture-specific characteristics (race/ethnicity as a proxy for region of origin), field of study, and English language proficiency. …",,2017.0,16,"{'url': 'http://ojed.org/index.php/jis/article/download/242/186', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32674/JIS.V7I1.242?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32674/JIS.V7I1.242, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9eba08b57681fd6d7e33066319aeb4e04139bbb9,"The AI-Atlas: Didactics for Teaching AI and Machine Learning On-Site, Online, and Hybrid","We present the “AI-Atlas” didactic concept as a coherent set of best practices for teaching Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to a technical audience in tertiary education, and report on its implementation and evaluation within a design-based research framework and two actual courses: an introduction to AI within the final year of an undergraduate computer science program, as well as an introduction to ML within an interdisciplinary graduate program in engineering. The concept was developed in reaction to the recent AI surge and corresponding demand for foundational teaching on the subject to a broad and diverse audience, with on-site teaching of small classes in mind and designed to build on the specific strengths in motivational public speaking of the lecturers. The research question and focus of our evaluation is to what extent the concept serves this purpose, specifically taking into account the necessary but unforeseen transfer to ongoing hybrid and fully online teaching since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our contribution is two-fold: besides (i) presenting a general didactic concept for tertiary engineering education in AI and ML, ready for adoption, we (ii) draw conclusions from the comparison of qualitative student evaluations (n = 24–30) and quantitative exam results (n = 62–113) of two full semesters under pandemic conditions with the result of previous years (participants from Zurich, Switzerland).

03b39e921f51931ad9d1ad910f2e2e164df2fb09,"ECHSA Presidential Address, CHSS-ECHSA Joint Meeting; Oct 24-25, 2020","First, I would like to thank Jose Fragata for his most kind, generous, and favorably exaggerated introduction. Jose’s leadership of the European Congenital Heart Surgeons Association (ECHSA) as its immediate past president has been landmark. Succeeding him as President of ECHSA has been the greatest honor of my professional life. It remains a daunting task to even attempt to match his contributions. In thinking about my presentation today, I have tried to look toward what the future might bring, not just for ECHSA, but for all of our subspecialty of congenital heart surgery. Stimulated by my experience of close collaboration with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) team of Professor Dimitris Bertsimas at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), during this past year, working on machine learning (ML) tools to analyze congenital heart surgery data, I decided to attempt to provide you with an overview of the fantastic opportunities and challenges provided to our field by the explosive progress of AI. Of course, I wish to emphasize at the outset that I am by no means an expert on AI. Therefore, this presentation provides only the perspective of a clinical pediatric cardiac surgeon wondering if and how the impressive achievements and capabilities of AI could be harnessed for the benefit of our patients. Some 50 years ago, Dr William Schwartz, in his paper entitled “Medicine and the Computer—the Promise and Problems of Change,” published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), predicted that “Computing science will probably exert its major effects by augmenting and, in some cases, largely replacing the intellectual functions of the physician.” As I will be showing you, this prediction has been proven largely correct, and, in fact, the potential impact of artificial intelligence in medicine is in fact even bolder: Increasingly, the dream of AI in Medicine is becoming to create a virtual global team of medical experts, holding the ever expanding accumulated wisdom of the decisions of millions of physicians, regarding the medical issues and resulting outcomes of billions of patients. This virtual global team should then be able to support the decisions of every physician with real-time personalized advice on the diagnosis, management, and actual therapeutic interventions for each patient. Before we consider whether such far-reaching promise is conceivably possible, some definitions are in order. Artificial Intelligence is defined by Encyclopedia Britannica in an arguably circular manner as “the ability of a digital computer or a computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.” This term was coined by John McCarthy in preparation for a Dartmouth Summer Research Project in 1965: “The study is to proceed on the basis that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” Thus, pivotal in all the achievements of AI has been the development of what has become known as ML, which is the application of AI systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programed. Humans can learn to make general complex associations from small amounts of data (eg, a toddler learning to recognize a cat), whereas machines require many more examples and do not have common sense, they do not have what the philosopher of science Michael Polanyi described as tacit or implicit understanding. Yet, although machines do need massive amounts of data to learn from, their ability to absorb such data is practically limitless, and they do not tire. Of course, there are too many types of machine learning for a nonexpert to understand, but it is useful to distinguish between two general categories: In the “supervised models,” data sets are prepared and labeled by humans according to predefined categories, and the relevant algorithms are designed to orient only to categories and concepts prespecified by us. In “unsupervised” models, pattern recognition is allowed to develop freely within the data, with algorithms learning without human-provided guidance. Interestingly, the subject of whether machines can be made to think has been considered in the 17th century by the French philosopher René Descartes, in his 1637 book Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One’s Reason and Seeking the Truth in the Sciences, famous for the quote “Cogito, ergo sum” (I think, therefore I am). Descartes seems to have predicted that machines could be constructed to perform some tasks as well as or better than humans, but, he felt they could neither be made to",World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery,2021.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/2150135120980382?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/2150135120980382, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0b41320a4cd2beb4159bb36f6dffff31f4787034,Regulatory Science Challenges : Encouraging Innovation Through an Adaptive Regulatory System,"ATMPs - a new era A boy from Hungary, Zente, was one and a half years old when the crowd-funding campaign to finance his life-saving medicine Zolgensma concluded with a happy end. He was the third European patient that received the new gene therapy, which replaces the function of the missing or nonworking survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene with a new, working copy of a human SMN gene that helps motor neuron cells work properly and survive. From a European perspective, it has been almost 15 years by now since regulatory framework for advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) had been established to ensure the free movement of these medicines within the European Union, to facilitate their access to the EU market, and to foster the competitiveness of European pharmaceutical companies in the field. Zolgensma has been approved in the EU in May 2020. The FDA expects it will be reviewing and approving up to 20 cell and gene therapies each year until 2025. Rapid development of technology and better understanding of the manufacturing challenges are not the only prerequisites of the growth. Assessment of products like Zolgensma requires very specific knowledge and often an adaptive approach from regulators. They have to gain enough experience and need to be able to summarize knowledge in guidelines that would help developers of products that are substantially different from traditional medicines. FDA issued seven new guidelines in January 2020, in which, for example, they highlight the importance of long-term follow-up for gene therapies that offer one-time fix for inherited diseases and where pre-market studies may have limited value. 2. Regulatory tools These examples may already show that rapid change in technology leads to new kinds of medicines that require a properly adapted regulatory system. Patients would expect state-of-the-art medicines within the shortest possible time frame, however, authorities are traditionally more cautious. Still, there are several various initiatives from the EMA and the FDA to foster early access to medicines. Some of these have been available for a longer time. EMA's accelerated assessment reduces the timeframe for review of innovative applications of medicines with major public health interest. Conditional marketing authorisation grants authorization before a complete dataset is available, and compassionate use allows the use of an unauthorized medicine for patients with an unmet medical need. A more recent regulatory tool of EMA is the priority medicines scheme (PRIME) that aims to enhance support for the development of medicines that are expected to make a real difference to patients. Early dialogue between EMA and the developers is a crucial part of the tool, together with accelerated assessment and continuous scientific advice and protocol assistance. Up to now, 282 applications for PRIME eligibility have been assessed by the CHMP of which 95 have received a green light. Most of the applicants are small and medium size enterprises, and the major therapeutic area is oncology. FDA has similar programs, such as the Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review designations, and is also aiming to facilitate and accelerate development and marketing authorization of key medicines. By 2018, about 70% of new drug approvals by the FDA were expedited, compared to about 50% in 2010. The result is a growing pro-portion of medicines authorized with less premarket evidence, a trade-off, that most patients with fatal or debilitating disease would likely accept. Nevertheless, conditional approval requires a strong post-marketing attention from regulators, and lack of enough evidence sometimes leads to difficult decisions. In April 2019 a fast-tracked cancer drug, Lartruvo was withdrawn because a large study was not able to prove a favourable benefit-risk profile, which was established previously on a smaller patient population. The regulators approach is not expected to be changed, but experience from such cases would gradually be built into the decision-making process. In addition to this real world evidence (RWE) and patient recorded outcomes may also help in decision making. 3. Digital revolution The rapid development of biotechnology is not the only area where an adaptive regulatory approach is needed. Digital medicine is a new field, as smartphones and sensors open up new ways of generating data. For example, collecting and analysing RWE seems to be a good solution for single arm studies where randomized trials are not feasible. FDA has approved easy-to-use devices that are able to track several physiological systems of our body, which in turn can give a boost to developments in this field. In addition to these simpler devices, digital revolution in terms of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive machine learning is another challenge that our regulatory systems should tackle. It has been recently announced that a new drug candidate, a long-acting and potent serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist, which was created using an artificial intelligence platform, will enter into clinical study. There are also numerous radiological applications based on AI, including computer aideddetection and diagnosis software, where images are analysed, and clinically relevant findings suggested to aid diagnostic decisions. Many of these new developments require a tailored approach from regulators to find a way for authorization within the existing regulatory framework. The fact, that many of these new developments are carried out by academic research groups or small companies without extensive regulatory experience, adds an extra layer of difficulty. To meet this challenge, EMA and the Heads of Medicines Agencies have established the EU-Innovation Network, to support medicine innovation and early development. As a milestone of its function, beginning in 1 February 2020 a pilot for simultaneous scientific advice is starting, where the applicants will receive a consolidated advice from the participating agencies. Innovative products often require specific expertise;therefore this new form of advice is also extremely beneficial for regulators as they are able to learn from each other and broaden their knowledge. 4. Conclusions The rapid development of pharmaceutical and digital technology requires a concerted action from all stakeholders. Or, as we all experience, a global pandemic can be an important driving force of the evolution of regulatory policies. Appropriate usage of currently available regulatory tools and a continuous discussion between academia, industry and regulators would be the only way to ensure quick access to state-of-the-art, safe and efficacious medicines, and medical devices. It is clearly shown currently by the concerted action of various stakeholders and series of rolling reviews which led to the expedited authorization of COVID-19 vaccines.",Acta pharmaceutica Hungarica,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.aph-hsps.hu/acta/index.php/aph/article/download/59/45', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33892/aph.2021.91.106-107?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33892/aph.2021.91.106-107, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

324d96d556031d7cf0b4973df5ed4bce9f121484,A Comprehensive Framework for Cyber Behavioral Analysis Based on a Systematic Review of Cyber Profiling Literature,"Cybercrime presents a significant threat to global society. With the number of cybercrimes increasing year after year and the financial losses escalating, law enforcement must advance its capacity to identify cybercriminals, collect probative evidence, and bring cybercriminals before the courts. Arguably to date, the approach to combatting cybercrime has been technologically centric (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware). Cybercrimes, however, are the result of human activities based on human motives. It is, therefore, important that any comprehensive law enforcement strategy for combatting cybercrime includes a deeper understanding of the hackers that sit behind the keyboards. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the state of the literature relating to the application of a human-centric investigative tool (i.e., profiling) to cybercrime by conducting a qualitative meta-synthesis. Adhering to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, this systematic review focuses specifically on cybercrime where a computer is the target (e.g., hacking, DDoS, distribution of malware). Using a comprehensive search strategy, this review used the following search terms: “cybercrime”, “computer crime”, “internet crime”, “cybercriminal”, “hacker”, “black hat”, “profiling”, “criminal profiling”, “psychological profiling”, “offender profiling”, “criminal investigative analysis”, “behavioral profiling”, “behavioral analysis”, “personality profiling”, “investigative psychology”, and “behavioral evidence analysis” in all combinations to identify the relevant literature in the ACM Digital Library, EBSCOhost databases, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, Scopus, PsychInfo, and Google Scholar. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 72 articles were included in the review. This article utilizes a systematic review of the current literature on cyber profiling as a foundation for the development of a comprehensive framework for applying profiling techniques to cybercrime—described as cyber behavioral analysis (CBA). Despite decades of research, our understanding of cybercriminals remains limited. A lack of dedicated researchers, the paucity of research regarding human behavior mediated by technology, and limited access to datasets have hindered progress. The aim of this article was to advance the knowledge base in cyber behavioral sciences, and in doing so, inform future empirical research relating to the traits and characteristics of cybercriminals along with the application of profiling techniques and methodologies to cybercrime.",Forensic Sciences,2023.0,10,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6756/3/3/32/pdf?version=1690031482', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/forensicsci3030032?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/forensicsci3030032, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Materials and Methods: A computer-based search was done from the year 1981 to 2020, but more specifically for IPS cells from 2006 and, the data were collected from various sources such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (via PubMed), Medline semantic scholar, BioMed Central, Directory of Open Access Journals, Science Open, and Bielefeld Academic Search Engine using the keywords stem cells in dentistry, IPS cells, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), prosthodontic regeneration using induced pluripotent cells, stem cells from the periodontal ligament, dental pulp, deciduous tooth, and dental follicle. We have also systematically reviewed the method to generate IPS cells and their research in obtaining various organs that is of concern in dentistry and especially prosthodontics. Results: Based on the keywords and cross-referencing, 69 articles were valid and selected for review. The chosen articles are organized according to the subheadings in the order of their publication date. This literature is based on studies conducted on animals, and it does not include the transplantation of IPS cells in humans. In 2006, when Yamanaka and Takahashi discovered IPS cells, there was a spike rise in the study of these cells. The number of clinical trials for IPS cells was around 75%, whereas for ESCs was just 25%. Most of the clinical trials for IPS cells have been done in the USA (37%) whereas India accounts for only 1% of the study. Conclusion: This review article suggests the future of IPS cells in regenerative dentistry and prosthodontics.

c86f23eea9490abc4b753d5ade4dba8da5818ef8,Genomic medicine France 2025.,"The French Plan for Genomic Medicine 2025 was commissioned by Prime Minister Manuel Valls in 2015, and developed by Aviesan (the French National Alliance for Life Sciences and Health) in 2016. It aims to position France as an international leader in personalized and precision medicine, fully integrating genomic medicine into healthcare pathways, and establishing a national genomic medicine industry, that promotes innovation and economic growth. Of the €670M invested in the first five years, around €230M will come from industry. The plan is based on 14 operating measures, linking healthcare, research and industry. Genome sequencing will be performed by 12 ultra-highthroughput services covering the whole country, two of which being launched in 2018. A national data analysis facility (Collecteur analyseur de données, CAD) will interpret and store data, and interface with other national and international databases. A Reference Center for Innovation, Assessment and Transfer (Centre de référence, d’innovation, d’expertise et de transfert, CRefIX), based at academic centers of excellence, is developing the procedures, tools and technologies to be deployrd at the sequencing centers and CAD, and will also be responsible for implementation, commissioning and workforce training. The CrefiX is already operational and has allowed the implementation of the first clinical projects such as pilot cohorts in rare disease, cancer, common disease (diabetes). Moreover, a population cohort will be used in 2016-2018 to test technological, clinical and regulatory barriers. Globally, about 10,000 individuals will be recruited in clinical centers as part of these pilot projects. It is anticipated that France will be capable of sequencing 235,000 genomes per year by 2020, corresponding to 20,000 patients with rare diseases together with their families, and 50,000 high priority patients with metastatic cancer or cancer refractory to treatment. The “French Model” proposed here is a mixed one involving care and research issues, in line with our healthcare system, its link with research, the economic model of diagnostic procedures and the need to set up a process for integrating scientific advances. This Plan also takes into account, in a concrete way, technological progress from sequencing to the storage and analysis of the resultant big data as well as confidential reporting back to doctors and patients. The strong international competition in the field of genomic medicine is explained by the challenges it raises. First and foremost, it is a public health issue. Genomic medicine is revolutionizing the care pathway and therefore how the public health system is organized. A large number of patients with rare diseases or cancer will benefit from routine sequencing of their genomes with more personalized diagnosis and treatment. Great progress has already been made with more common diseases (metabolic, cardiovascular, neurological, etc.) through genome sequencing, above and",Annals of Oncology,2018.0,21,"{'url': 'http://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923753419454732/pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'publisher-specific-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/annonc/mdy027?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdy027, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Billions of dollars are spent each year on clean, renewable energy and the operations of traditional power plants to meet the demands of electricity consumption here in the U.S. and around the world. Energy companies are always feeling the pressure to provide the electricity people rely on every day in their personal and professional lives. With bigger, more powerful computers, and the fast development of new technology, the demand for electricity will continue to grow forcing energy companies to adopt more efficient inspection applications to provide high quality, sustainable power in the future. The U.S. generated 4.12 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity in 2020. The leader in electric generation is natural gas with 40 percent of the total amount. Natural gas was followed by nuclear at 20 percent, coal at 19 percent, wind at 8.4 percent, hydro at 7.3 percent, and solar at 2.3 percent. 



The NDT industry along with engineering and materials science is a critical part of the longevity of new and aging power plants around the world. This paper will discuss through examples and case studies the technology and analysis that goes into power plant condition assessments. Emphasis will be given to the NDT 4.0 technologies used in power plants to overcome traditional challenges when dealing with condition assessment inspections. It will be show that no one technology can be the answer to all problems, but that it takes a team of engineers and NDT personnel to provide high quality assessments that provide meaningful results. We will also show how Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and smart technologies combined with engineering analysis and materials science can create long lived, safe, and efficient power across many different power plant types.

1b9844d2271eba8c087301b223c522ec5a927371,BERT-Based Hybrid RNN Model for Multi-class Text Classification to Study the Effect of Pre-trained Word Embeddings,"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic which started in the year 2020, many nations had imposed lockdown to curb the spread of this virus. People have been sharing their experiences and perspectives on social media on the lockdown situation. This has given rise to increased number of tweets or posts on social media. Multi-class text classification, a method of classifying a text into one of the pre-defined categories, is one of the effective ways to analyze such data that is implemented in this paper. A Covid-19 dataset is used in this work consisting of fifteen pre-defined categories. This paper presents a multi-layered hybrid model, LSTM followed by GRU, to integrate the benefits of both the techniques. The advantages of word embeddings techniques like GloVe and BERT have been implemented and found that, for three epochs, the transfer learning based pre-trained BERT-hybrid model performs one percent better than GloVe-hybrid model but the state-of-the-art, fine-tuned BERT-base model outperforms the BERT-hybrid model by three percent, in terms of validation loss. It is expected that, over a larger number of epochs, the hybrid model might outperform the fine-tuned model. © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

However, the automated aquaponics solution did not fully comply with data privacy and portability best practices to protect the data of household owners. The purpose of this study is to develop a data privacy and portability layer on top of the previously developed automated Aquaponics units.Design/methodology/approachDesign Science Research (DSR) is the research method implemented in this study.FindingsGeneral Data Protection and Privacy Regulations (GDPR)-inspired principles empowering data subjects including data minimisation, purpose limitation, storage limitation as well as integrity and confidentiality can be implemented in a federated learning (FL) architecture using Pinecone Matrix home servers and edge devices.Research limitations/implicationsThe literature reviewed for this study demonstrates that the GDPR right to data portability can have a positive impact on data protection by giving individuals more control over their own data.

7d4f18134f40b8905d598aae2ad93572fd6035e1,Facilitating Climate Change Action in the Ocean Sciences Using the Interactive Computer Model En‐ROADS,"Taking effective climate action at an individual, community, or organizational level can be challenging. Although science-based actions should be a top priority, there is poor alignment between science and the beliefs and attitude of the public (Rooney-Varga et al. 2021). Despite the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluding that it is possible to reach the Paris Agreement goals through a rapid transition to a low-carbon society (IPCC 2018), many individuals and organizations find themselves overwhelmed or uncertain about what effective climate action looks like. Additional barriers to action exist due to complex social and cultural beliefs (Kahan et al. 2012; Doherty and Webler 2016) and key misunderstandings about energy systems and climate (Sterman and Sweeney 2002). Surprisingly, concern about climate change is not uniformly high among individuals with high levels of science literacy and reasoning (Kahan et al. 2012). In order to reach the Paris Agreement goals, it is crucial to break down barriers and build support for the policies and actions needed. Scienceinformed action can be motivated using different approaches, and an effective method is using interactive computer models combined with engaging scenario building and discussion (Rooney-Varga et al. 2020). Therefore, a recently developed interactive learning experience was brought to attendees of the Ocean Sciences Meeting (OSM) in early 2022 in the workshop “Exploring climate change solutions for a sustainable future—a workshop and discussion centered around using a powerful interactive climate model in classrooms, the workplace, and beyond,” in order to prompt discussion and motivate action among students and scientists. The workshop attracted approximately 25 participants from a wide range of disciplines and included undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and interdisciplinary marine scientists. At the workshop, participants were tasked with using the En-ROADS climate model (https://en-roads. climateinteractive.org) to explore how climate actions and policies affect outcomes such as global temperature increase, air quality, and energy prices. The En-ROADS model is built using the latest science; however, unlike larger models from the IPCC and International Energy Agency, it is fast, user-friendly, and freely available, so it can be used in interactive activities to evaluate solutions for climate change. The linking of climate research with systems dynamics thinking enables participants to test their actions and combination of solutions and policies on a global scale. Examples of the actions available for testing include increasing energy efficiency of buildings, carbon pricing, reducing deforestation, and exploring technological carbon removal. For each user-specified action, the model displays many outcomes, including global temperature increase, sea level rise, energy price, net greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, crop yields, and changes in global biodiversity. In line with the Paris Agreement, the goal of the workshop was to limit global warming to a maximum of 2 C, or ideally 1.5 C, above preindustrial temperatures. By using the model and interacting with each other and facilitators during the workshop, it was hoped that participants would have an experience that was both informative and motivating, while offering new insight to the systems of energy and climate. In the first part of the workshop, participants brainstormed the climate actions currently used in their community or organization. Several of these actions were selected and individually tested in the En-ROADS model to show the effect that the entire world taking a similar action would have. For example, if a municipal government offered rebates on electric heat pump installations and improved building insulation, the “electrification” and “energy efficiency” actions for Buildings and Industry were increased a modest amount, to simulate the effect that decreased fossil fuels consumption and more efficient energy use would have on a global scale. In that example, the modest actions result in a decrease in the overall energy footprint, with less reliance on coal and natural gas, which results in decreased emissions, PM 2.5 air pollution, and a final projected global temperature of 3.4 C by the year 2100 (Fig. 1). After several tests of individual actions, which showed only small improvements in the outcome for the projected temperature and other metrics, the participants were guided by facilitators to cumulatively build a climate scenario that incorporated all of their current climate actions with additional actions thought to be necessary to reach 1.5 C. For each climate action, discussion centered around the feasibility and impact of the solutions, revealing some surprising equity and co-benefit considerations.",Limnology and Oceanography Bulletin,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/lob.10504?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/lob.10504, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Women of color are underrepresented in computing careers and have lower pass rates on the AP CS exams than their White and Asian peers. AP Computer Science A (CSA) is equivalent to a college-level first course for computer science majors while AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) is equivalent to an introductory course for non-majors. Secondary students (ages 14-19) take AP courses for college credit and/or placement. Sisters Rise Up offers remote help sessions run by near-peer undergraduate students and uses free and interactive ebooks. Sisters Rise Up originated at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2014. This paper reports on an effort to scale Sisters Rise Up to six institutions during the 2019-2020 academic year as well as an effort to support women of color through a single institution during 2020-2021. In 2019-2020 there were problems with getting Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, recruiting, training, and program fidelity. However, at least two of the six institutions had a high pass rate on the AP CS exams in 2019-2020. In 2019-2020 there were 17 women of color enrolled from five states, while in 2020-2021 Sisters Rise Up had 19 women of color enrolled from 12 states.

cc6cc834577b69ab05ca67fcaa99f12bd263a617,Depression Status and Longitudinal Changes in Serum Uric Acid Concentration in Chinese Adults,"BACKGROUND: In the current cross-sectional studies and short-term clinical trials, the directionality of the association between depression and changes in uric acid concentration remains unclear. Moreover, there are limited prospective data from relevant studies, and there is no good way to predict the risk of CVD caused by changes in uric acid caused by depression. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the association between Depression Survey Scale scores, grades of depressive status, and 8-year (2014–2022) longitudinal changes in uric acid concentrations in a community cohort to explain why depressive status contributes to CVD events. On this basis, we will collect richer medical data sets and look forward to creating better artificial intelligence prediction models in the future, which can accurately monitor the risk of CVD caused by depression, and use engineering methodologies and computer science to reduce the public health burden on society. DESIGN: The study included a total of 4202 Chinese adults (mean age: 66.9 years) who did not have cardiovascular disease, cancer and major renal disease during the shredded visit. Depressive status (baseline) was assessed by the 2014 PHQ-9 scale, which has a total score of 27 points, and was categorized into the following different levels of depression based on participants' questionnaire scores: normal (0–4 points), mild depression (5–9 points), moderate depression (10–14 points), moderately severe depression (15–19 points), and severe depression (20–27 points). SUA concentrations were measured in 2014, 2018, 2020, and 2022. We used generalized estimating equation modeling to examine the association between baseline depressive status and changes in SUA concentration, adjusting for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, history of stroke, tea-drinking habits, sleep quality, health self-assessment scores, and cognitive scores. RESULTS: Depressive state is related to the variation of SUA concentration (P<0.05). This variation may be increased or decreased. Compared with people without depression, the SUA concentration of moderately and severely depressed patients dropped significantly, with the result being -54.956 µ mol/L (95% CI: -88.284, -21.627 µ mol/L); the SUA concentration of moderately depressed patients increased significantly, with the result was 34.127 µ mol/L (95% CI: 9.117, 59.136), respectively (P=0.000) after adjusting for confounding factors. Under different depression scores, in the 15–18 score range (that is, defined as a moderate to severe depression state), compared with those with a score of 0, the SUA levels of patients with scores of 15, 16, 17, and 18 showed a downward trend, respectively. -112.777µ mol/L (95%CI: -140.282, -85.271µ mol/L), -72.777µ mol/L (95%CI: -76.141, -69.412 µ mol/L), -33.777 µ mol/L (95%CI: -37.141, -30.412 µ mol/L), -15.777 µ mol/L (95%CI: -19.141, -12.412 µ mol/L), after adjusting for potential confounders, respectively (P=0.000); for people with a score of 13 (that is, people defined as moderately depressed), their SUA concentration increased significantly, with the result being 44.233 µ mol/L (95% CI: 40.589, 47.588 11 mol/L/y). Depressive states are associated with significant fluctuations in SUA concentrations. CONCLUSION: Depressive state is related to large fluctuations in SUA; after 8 years of follow-up, it was found that SUA in patients with moderate depression showed a sharp downward trend, and that in patients with moderate to severe depression, SUA showed a sharp upward trend. Depressed patients have greater SUA variability, which may lead to the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. In the future, AI can be used through engineering methodologies to build better prediction models, accurately monitor the dynamic changes of SUA in depressed people, and provide better and more targeted intervention plans, and accurately predict the risk of other diseases caused by depression. Leverage engineering-driven analytics to provide better, more targeted intervention options for patients with underlying CVD caused by depression. From the perspective of computer science, we can reduce individual disease risks, reduce the overall public health burden on society, and achieve broader public health goals.",2023 17th International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering (CME),2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CME60059.2023.10565415?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CME60059.2023.10565415, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c6c9dbe85f78f9536bc08888a5bfa8bda3b8134a,Exploring Student Experiences in Early Computing Courses during Emergency Remote Teaching,"Spring 2020 brought enormous change to student learning, as universities scrambled to put into place support structures to aid students' learning in a remote context. Computer science education was both well-positioned for this change and faced unique challenges, e.g. that students often need significant (in-person) support with programming. In this study we examine how aspects of students' remote learning experience in spring 2020 compared to the same aspects in previous in-person, pre-COVID offerings of 6 lower- to mid-division computer science courses at UC San Diego (UCSD), a large US research university. We were in a unique position to make this comparison because we had been collecting data on several aspects of students' course experiences throughout the 2019-2020 academic year. We found, surprisingly, that most elements of students' experiences that we examined were unchanged, or even improved, in spring 2020. Students in spring reported similar or lower stress levels and found their courses similarly or less challenging relative to previous quarters. However, some aspects did degrade. Students had less connection with their peers (particularly in introductory classes), more interference from family obligations, and higher drop/fail rates in some classes. Surprisingly, these results hold across all assessed demographics. Our results indicate that the actions UCSD and its CS instructors took to mitigate the stresses of remote learning in spring 2020 were largely successful and provide implications for improving education beyond the pandemic.",Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,2021.0,13,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3430665.3456315', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3430665.3456315?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3430665.3456315, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Within this context, 117 postgraduate theses submitted between 2014 and 2020 were analyzed in terms of their types, number of pages, publication language and year, relevant institutions, research methods, keywords, subject areas, effects and disadvantages of the model, and citation characteristics (number of citations, frequently cited journals, articles, books, authors). Content and citation analyses were employed to analyze the data of the study. The findings showed that most of the postgraduate studies were submitted at Gazi University and were carried out in a mixed research design. It has been also revealed that the most frequent keywords were “FCM”, “academic achievement” and “teaching English as a foreign language”. Moreover, it was determined that the FCM is a teaching method that is frequently used in language education and preferred by different academic fields of educational sciences. So, the model has been seen to have a positive effect on the learning environment in terms of academic achievement, motivation, permanent learning, and classroom interaction. However, it has been also determined that there are disadvantages such as the lack of digital competencies of teachers and students during the process and the cost in terms of time and technological infrastructure.

30d500bdac42ae137d8cae1468558e5256999974,CHANGES IN THE TRENDS IN THE USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TOOLS FOR FUTURE PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION SPECIALISTS,"Formulation of the problem. The study aims to substantiate and determine the dynamics of changes in the use of information and communication tools in the process of training future specialists in vocational and technological education. 
Materials and methods. The study used theoretical analysis, surveys (questionnaires, interviews), observations, systematization, analysis of data, comparisons, and generalizations.
Results. The analysis of a survey of future specialists in vocational and technological education conducted in 2016-2021 at TNPU named V. Hnatyuk is presented. Despite the high and medium levels of grades in the school computer science course, before the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the students rated their readiness to use computer technology as low, which was explained by gaps in practical training, software updates, and occasional use of digital technology in the classroom. The locations of students' work with computer equipment in the 2019/2020 academic year (at home, in offices and laboratories, with friends, at the place of work of parents, in Internet clubs, at the place of employment, etc.) were studied. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the prompted introduction of distance learning, the use of computer technology and software in all classes, which has helped to increase the IT skills of participants in the educational process.
Conclusions. Analyzing the research data, it can be argued that the COVID-19 Pandemic has led to the rapid development of ICT in education. The dominant means of ensuring the educational process were laptops (99.2%) and mobile devices (98.4%). Most used software - Microsoft Office, Google cloud services; online platforms - Zoom, Google Meet, digital board Padlet; social networks - Viber, Telegram, WhatsApp; LMS systems (Google Class, Moodle).

8ff6ffe82c55ce2ab5c0468d29a290972972fdfc,Sistemas de información: competencias profesionales 2020,"Several authors warn about the necessity to adapt the university training to the professional needs demanded by society and to consider professional competencies when designing new academic programs. However, a great number of academic programs offered by European universities do not fulfill this requisite, maintaining an important discrepancy between the graduate profile and the professional profile required by society. There have been several experiences in the academic and professional realms to facilitate the integration of both profiles. The aim of the present work was to define which are the competencies of the computer science professionals, that could fulfill the expectations of the organizations requiring their professional services. In order to determine the professional competencies of the computer science professional adapted to the historical context, the competencies emerging from current professional profiles were defined after validation from the groups having real concern in this definition. A search of the professional competencies present in computer science academic programs of renowned educational institutions was conducted, compiling a list of the ones most representative of the professional performance expected in this field. These competencies were analyzed in light of the academic programs aims and then were subjected to examination by employers, faculty, students and graduated professionals. With that information, the professional competencies were defined. To analyze the results, methodology used by Maldonado Rojas (2007: 235-237) was adapted, using frequencies present for each value of a scale codified in interpretation categories. Competencies present in the final proposal were the ones belonging to the interpretative categories equal or higher than the “Satisfactory” level. The study describes the percentage of rating individuals adhering to each option of the list. From the point of view of the research design adopted, it is estimated that the list compiled during the process is appropriate for the professional profile of the computer science professional for the year 2020, since 97,6% of competencies proposed were situated in the interpretative levels of Satisfactory and Optimum. With the 80 professional competencies proposed, it is expected to contribute with the curricula design of the computer science academic programs in Latin American, or to the ones equivalent in other countries.",,2016.0,1,"{'url': 'http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/bitstream/handle/10915/50615/Documento_completo.pdf?sequence=1', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.19044/ESJ.2016.V12N1P63?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.19044/ESJ.2016.V12N1P63, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This research used descriptive qualitative research methods and a case study approach. The subjects of this study were three teachers of grades IV, V, and VI SD Angkasa Colomadu in the academic year 2020/2021. Data collection techniques used interviews and documentation. The data validity test techniques used the triangulation technique. Data analysis techniques used interactive analysis techniques Miles and Huberman consisting of data reduction, data display, and conclusions. The results show that the teachers felt that learning sciences in the network was not optimal. Teachers do not optimally apply basic process skills. The teachers feel the limitation in the communication process.  They also have a restriction on directing the students to formulate hypotheses, conclude the material, guide experimental activities, attract students to ask questions, guide the measurement process, guide observation activities, classify, interpret, and predict processes due to media limitations.

deaca8acf9f26844439f969ddbe27b9388e6d400,Redefining Engineering Education as Skill Training,"The year 2020 has forced many institutions to suddenly convert wholly to online education as necessitated by a global pandemic. Online education introduces a physical distance between the instructor and the students that creates many barriers to learning in traditional lecture-style teaching. However, the rapid shift to online learning has opened many minds to the value of online educational tools from both the instructor's and student's points of view. For engineering education, the value of online learning can be increased through the adoption of a new perspective that engineering is a skill. Students who graduate from engineering programs are valued for 12 key skills: (1) problem-solving, (2) computer science, (3) industry skills, (4) pressure management, (5) teamwork, (6) creativity, (7) structural analysis, (8) communication, (9) attention to detail, (10) educational commitment, (11) data modeling, and (12) leadership. Possession of these skills has even led to many engineering graduates being recruited outside of the field of engineering due to the value they offer. With the true value of graduates being the skills they possess, it stands to reason that the curriculum of engineering programs should be designed for the development of these skills. By adjusting the curriculum through the use of repeated attempts on assignments and quizzes, students can be prompted to increase their investment in courses and thus improve the skills they develop. Offering immediate feedback through the use of online tools can further improve skill development by highlighting shortfalls to students so they can adjust accordingly before engaging in their next attempt. Redefining engineering education as a skill development offers the opportunity to take advantage of the current online learning situation to create new learning environments that are more optimized for the production and development of skillful engineers that are highly valued in the workforce.",Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Faculty Senate Research Conference: Higher Education During Pandemics,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.21467/proceedings.135.5', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21467/proceedings.135.5?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21467/proceedings.135.5, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Due to the pandemic, classes in Swedish universities moved abruptly to an online format during the spring of 2020. Content analysis was used to analyze 10 interviews with third-year bachelor students. The results were discussed in the light of the community of inquiry theoretical framework. We found that when learning online, students communicated and collaborated via a class-wide Discord server, an online communication platform originally developed for the gaming community. The use of Discord was seen to change the students’ expectations of student-instructor interaction. The students’ frequency of questions to the instructor decreased drastically when learning in the online environment compared to the on-campus environment, both during live-lectures and outside of class. The students perceived instructor engagement and presence in both live and recorded lectures as more important for their learning online than in the on-campus setting and wanted more interaction during lectures. Discord created a community for the students. However, the social aspects of learning were still missed. Many interviewees found it hard to keep focus and struggled with self-discipline and identifying a work structure. Clear benefits given for online learning were flexibility and convenience of time and place. Students also experienced group work to be more efficient online.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962518?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962518, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is a federal agency that was set up in 1950 and invests in basic research across the spectrum
 to support discovery and innovation. In the NSF's Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Performance and Financial Highlights report Director Sethuraman Panchanathan said that the agency is 'the Nation's preeminent source of federal funding for basic research in computer science, engineering, biology, the
 social sciences, mathematics, geosciences, the physical sciences, and education'. NSF has an annual budget of around US$8.3 billion and a broad reach, directly supporting an estimated 313,000 people in 2020. This support assisted researchers, postdoctoral fellows, trainees, teachers
 and students in bringing their ideas to life and, ultimately, moving closer to real-world impacts with the potential to solve societal challenges. Discovery, learning and research infrastructure are NSF's key strategic goals and it places emphasis on diverse, interdisciplinary and international
 collaborations in order to extend its reach as far as possible and invests in research connected to learning, innovation and service to society. Assistant directors head up NSF's seven sections; each one intended to support research and education in science and engineering. The sections are:
 biological sciences, computer and information science and engineering, engineering, geosciences, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioural and economic sciences, and education and human resources. In 2020, $8.4 billion funding was awarded by NSF to 1,900 colleges, universities

d2c9f54a7905dcedd09be8c6202fba6ce92e8cea,Comparing Access and Participation Outcomes of Schools Engaged in a Multi-school CS and Cybersecurity Intervention (Evaluation),"In early 2020, a cohort of 30 high schools engaged in a year-long intervention designed to increase their ability to offer Computer Science (CS) and Cybersecurity education to their students. After we performed an evaluation on the intervention's impacts, we turned our attention to whether or not the outcomes were influenced by engagement of the schools in the cohort. In this research paper, we focus on the guiding research question: How do schools' engagement in an intervention designed to build equitable CS and Cybersecurity education capacity impact schools' course offerings and students' participation in these courses? To measure equitable impact, we evaluated changes to actual CS and Cybersecurity course offerings and enrollment at the schools. We focused on the differences in participation across student gender and race/ethnicity as well as participation levels at the different schools across three years prior to the intervention and one year after the intervention. Findings indicate that, despite the disruption to schools from the COVID-19 pandemic, schools engaged in the program had very significant increases in AP CSP, AP CS A, and Cybersecurity course offerings and enrollment, particularly at schools that serve students from low-income families. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/41065.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--41065?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--41065, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Wikipedia, Britannica, Baidu Baike, and Scholarpedia","Encyclopedias are sometimes cited by scholarly publications, despite concerns about their credibility as sources for academic information. This study investigates trends from 2002 to 2020 in citing two crowdsourced and two expert-based encyclopedias to investigate whether they fit differently into the research landscape: Wikipedia, Britannica, Baidu Baike, and Scholarpedia. This is the first systematic comparison of the uptake of four major encyclopedias within academic research. Scopus searches were used to count the number of documents citing the four encyclopedias in each year. Wikipedia was by far the most cited encyclopedia, with up to 1% of Scopus documents citing it in Computer Science. Citations to Wikipedia increased exponentially until 2010, then slowed down and started to decrease. Both the Britannica and Scholarpedia citation rates were increasing in 2020, however. Disciplinary and national differences include Britannica being popular in Arts and Humanities, Scholarpedia in Neuroscience, and Baidu Baike in Chinese-speaking countries/territories. The results confirm that encyclopedias have minor value for academic research, often for background and definitions, with the most suitable one varying between fields and countries, and with the first evidence that the popularity of crowdsourced encyclopedias may be waning.",El Profesional de la Informacion,2021.0,8,"{'url': 'https://revista.profesionaldelainformacion.com/index.php/EPI/article/download/81073/63027', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3145/epi.2021.sep.08?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3145/epi.2021.sep.08, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Based on a collaboration among two public research universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA, the goal of the project is to establish an institutionalized middle school computer science curriculum in the districts. The CS curriculum incorporates digital literacy skills as an integral aspect of learning computer science, and is based on students developing mobile apps that provide social and community good. Here, we share our professional learning process during the project's first year, which had been developed iteratively and dynamically adjusted to a remote format in response to exigencies of Spring 2020. The paper includes analysis of three data sets from teacher-participants: (1) their questions about the nature of the project, which we categorized into three levels: project, district and teacher levels. These questions bridge the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners; (2) analysis of semi-structured interview conversations with more than half of the teacher-participants; and (3) teacher survey responses. Our findings include two recommendations: that RPP projects elicit teacher questions to illuminate the three levels identified, and use strategies that engage teachers in designing a professional learning process for teaching computer science.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2021.0,7,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3408877.3432519?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3432519, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

06f640200bc1dc01d82900871d2e8372125da07f,14th Conference on DATA ANALYSIS METHODS for Software Systems,"DAMSS-2023 is the 14th International Conference on Data Analysis Methods for Software Systems, held in Druskininkai, Lithuania. Every year at the same venue and time. The exception was in 2020, when the world was gripped by the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement of people was severely restricted. After a year’s break, the conference was back on track, and the next conference was successful in achieving its primary goal of lively scientific communication. The conference focuses on live interaction among participants. For better efficiency of communication among participants, most of the presentations are poster presentations. 
This format has proven to be highly effective. However, we have several oral sections, too. The history of the conference dates back to 2009 when 16 papers were presented. It began as a workshop and has evolved into a well-known conference. The idea of such a workshop originated at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, now the Institute of Data Science and Digital Technologies of Vilnius University. The Lithuanian Academy of Sciences and the Lithuanian Computer Society supported this idea, which gained enthusiastic acceptance from both the Lithuanian and international scientific communities. This year’s conference features 84 presentations, with 137 registered participants from 11 countries. The conference serves as a gathering point for researchers from six Lithuanian universities, making it the main annual meeting for Lithuanian computer scientists. The primary aim of the conference is to showcase research conducted at Lithuanian and foreign universities in the fields of data science and software engineering. The annual organization of the conference facilitates the rapid exchange of new ideas within the scientific community. Seven IT companies supported the conference this year, indicating the relevance of the conference topics to the business sector. In addition, the conference is supported by the Lithuanian Research Council and the National Science and Technology Council (Taiwan, R. O. C.). The conference covers a wide range of topics, including Applied Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Bioinformatics, Blockchain Technologies, Business Rules, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Deep Learning, High-Performance Computing, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Medical Informatics, Modelling Educational Data, Ontological Engineering, Optimization, Quantum Computing, Signal Processing.

81c504d5bb498d17891961d4ee8b23b2c8250982,A System Dynamics Model of Urban Railway Demand Prediction for Safety and Security Improvement: Lessons Learned from Indonesian Railway Network,"The number of passengers on the Indonesian urban rail network (KRL Jabodetabek) continues to increase from year to year, causing problems like passenger overcapacity at stations and on trains. The safety and security of KRL needs to be improved by managing the demand for KRL passengers. This paper aims to predict the number of passengers, trains, and employees, as well as the total income and amount of subsidies required to support rational policymaking for future railway management. The prediction was carried out based on system dynamics modeling, a framework demonstration technique integrating system science with computer simulation. Our system dynamics model was built, and validated on time series data from 2014 to 2020. The results show that, the number of passengers, trains, and employees increased annually from 2014 to 2019, but decreased in 2020, for the human movement is restricted by COVID-19. According to the simulation results, the daily number of electric rail train passengers was projected to reach 1,387,295 in 2035, and 1,365 extra trains would be required to cater to the passengers. The safety and security of trains, which are strongly correlated with the management of urban electric rail passenger demand, would be jeopardized, if the number of passenger requests is out of control. The research provides unique empirical and theoretical materials for academics, and sheds new light on the importance of safety and security enhancement to urban rail network. © 2022 WITPress.

Jones(2005)는 이렇게 점차 복잡성이 증 가하는 현대사회에서는 지식을 찾기 위해서 기존의 지식을 이해하는 데 드는 일종의 지적 부담(Burden of Knowledge)이 누적적으로 커지 게 되고, 이러한 점이 전문가간의 다학제적 협업이나 융합의 필요성 을 만들고 있다고 역설한 바 있다. 따라서 미래 산업사회를 담당할 이공계 인재의 육성에 있어서 창의⋅융합은 필수적 덕목이 되었으며, 이는 초중등 교육과정에서도 반영되어 실시되고 있는 교육의 추세라 할 수 있다. 공학분야는 다른 어떤 분야보다도 실생활이나 현장과 대학교육의 거리가 짧고, 졸업생의 대부분이 자신의 전공과 비교적 관련이 많은 직종에 취업하게 되는 편이므로 공과대학 학생들을 위한 융합교육은 그 어느 학생들을 위한 것보다 중요하다 할 것이다. 또한 공학은 실용 성과 유용성을 기본 바탕으로 하는 학문이기 때문에 주어진 환경 조 건 하에서 문제 상황에 대한 최적의 해(解)를 도출해 내는 것을 미덕 으로 여기고 있다(Lee, 2016). 이러한 창의적 문제해결력을 지닌 공학 도를 키우기 위해서는 기존 지식을 상황에 맞게 재구성할 수 있는 능력과 다양한 관점에서 세상을 조망할 수 있는 역량을 키워주는 것 이 중요하다. 다시 말해 오늘날의 공학교육은 자신의 전공 영역과 같은 전형적 사고방식에서 벗어나 폭넓게 아우르며 생각해 볼 수 있 는 그리고 다른 생각과 문화를 가진 이들과 자유롭게 협업할 수 있는 소통능력과 공감능력을 향상시킬 교육이 필요하다(Park, 2014). 이러 한 지향점을 한마디로 압축하면 바로 융합교육이 된다. 공과대학 교육에서의 융합교육시도는 국내외에서 이제 다양하게 이루어진 바 있다. 공과대학의 융합교육을 선도했던 미국의 경우 MIT Media Lab이 가장 선도적인 사례라 할 수 있다. 공학에 예술과 인문학 등 이질적인 학문을 접목시킨 연구기관으로 ‘상상력을 발전시킨다’ 라는 목표를 가진다. 학문의 벽을 허물고 상상하는 모든 것을 연구할 수 있다고 자부하는 기관이지만 아쉽게도 학부수준 교육을 담당하는 기관은 아니며 연구중심의 교육을 수행하고 있다(Hong, 2008). 이들 의 융합의 방식은 점차 인접 전공에 필요에 의해 스며들 듯 확장하며 변하거나 커나가는 경우가 있는데 이때, 각 경계에서 교역지대 (trading zone)를 형성한다(Collins, Evans, & Gorman, 2007; Galison, 1997; Lee, Lee, & Ha, 2013; Oh et al., 2012). 예를 들어서, 정보를 깊게 다루던 문헌정보학이 확장된 정보과학이 있고, 이것이 ICT 기술 과 융합하면서 나온 것이 디지털정보융합기술이다. 그 중에서도 웹 자체에 대한 과학이며 공학적 접근을 주창하는 웹 과학(Web science), 그리고 이렇게 태동된 컴퓨터 과학과 컴퓨터 공학에서 시작하여 다양 한 분야로 확장된 인간과 컴퓨터의 상호작용(HCI; Human-Computer Interaction), 마지막으로 최근 문화 및 예술과 융합한 경우인 감성 및 문화과학이 있다(Hong, 2008). 이것은 최근 NSF가 당초 언급한 인지과학의 CT(cogno technology)와는 다른 또 하나의 CT(culture technology)로 조명 받고 있다. 중간형태의 절충 교육으로 미국 UCSD 의 Bioinformatics Program과 같은 다학제 연합 협동과정 형성을 통한 융합교육 시도도 있었다(KIAT, 2015). 우리나라 공과대학들의 융합교육 역시 활발히 시도되고 있다. 우 선, 물리적으로 공과대학 내에 학과 자체를 융합형 학과로 개설하여 교육을 실시하려 한 사례가 있다. 국민대학교의 자동차IT융합학과, 창의IT융합학과(POSTECH), 휴먼ICT융합학과(성균관대) 등이 그 사 례라 할 수 있다(KIAT, 2015). 두 번째로는 공과대학 학생들의 교양 교육 차원에서의 융합을 시도한 경우들이다(Sung, Choi, & Kang, 2016; Han, Ko, & Choi, 2016). 이는 주로 예술이나 인문학 등과 같은 교양학부 교육과 공학의 융합을 꾀한 것으로 공대생을 위한 글 쓰기 교육(Park, 2012; Shin, 2009, 2012), 미술교육과의 공학의 융합 (Lee, 2016), 디자인교육과 공학의 융합교육과정 모색(Sung, Choi, & Kang, 2016) 등 다양한 방향이 제시되고 시도되었다. 세 번째는 전공교육차원에서의 융합교육시도이다. 실무능력을 갖춘 인재 육성 을 위해 2001년부터 공학교육인증원(ABEEK; Accreditation Board for Engineering Education of Korea)에서 시도해오고 있는 공학교육 인증제 프로그램에서도 교육과정 내에 다양한 복합학제 및 다학제 설계 과정 및 융합형 교육과정을 도입하고 있다. 특히 다양한 전공분 야를 망라하는 현장의 복잡성을 실감하게 하는 현장중심 교육과정의 강화로 공과대학 내의 융합형 프로그램의 수는 전국 어느 공대를 막 론하고 급증하고 있는 추세이다(KIAT, 2015). 공과대학의 교육과정 은 반드시 공학인증제 프로그램이 아니더라도 티칭포트폴리오 문화 나 CQI 보고서 작성과 같이 학습목표와 성과에 의한 철저한 사후관리 와 반성 그리고 환류분석이 오래전부터 체계적으로 이루어져왔다. 그러나 이는 대부분 지식적인 성취도 영역에 대해서만 이루어지고 있으며, 동기나 태도, 가치관과 같은 정의적 영역에 대한 형성정도는 알아보지 못하고 있는 실정이다. 학생들이 융합적 역량을 키우기 위 해서는 무엇보다 다른 영역을 배타적으로 보지 않고 융합을 시대적 사명으로 여기는 ‘융합에 대한 태도’가 먼저 형성된 뒤라야 할 것이다. 실제로 이들이 산업현장에 진출하여 팀장급 기획자가 되어 현장의 문제를 해결할 때, 다른 전공 영역의 많은 실무기술진들과 복합학제 적 팀이 되어 문제해결을 할 것인지 아니면 자신의 분야만으로 해결 할 것인지를 결정하는 결정적 요인은 이들이 학생시절 형성한 ‘융합 에 대한 태도’에 달려있을 것이다. 따라서 융합능력을 배양함에 앞서 융합에 대한 태도를 긍정적으로 형성시켜야 하고 그런 연후에 창의적 이고 융합적인 문제해결력을 길러주어야 할 것이다. 융합에 대한 태도를 확인하기 위한 검사도구로는 Shin et al.(2014) The Relationship of Engineering Education Accreditation Program, Gender, and Academic Year with Attitude towards Convergence among Engineering Students 115 에 의해 개발된 것이 있다. 그러나 이는 고등학생들을 대상으로 연구⋅ 개발 된 것으로 이후에 Shin, Ha, & Lee(2014)에 의하여 전국 17개 시도의 6,036명의 학생들에게 일반화타당도를 검증한 검사도구인 것 은 사실이지만, 일반 인문계 고등학생들을 위하여 개발된 검사도구이 다. 따라서 아직까지 대학생을 대상으로 적용된 사례가 없으며, 공과 대학 학생들의 융합에 대한 태도 점검을 위한 용도로 사용함이 적절 한지에 대해 연구된 바가 없다. 따라서 이 연구에서는 Shin et al.(2014)에 의하여 개발된 융합에 대한 태도 검사도구를 공과대학 학생들에게 적용하여 이들을 위한 융합교육과정 경험을 통해 형성되 는 융합에 대한 태도 변화를 알아보는 용도로 활용할 수 있는지 타당 도와 신뢰도를 확인해 보고자 하였다. 뿐만 아니라 최근 이루어지는 연구들을 살펴보면, 측정 도구 중심 관점의 변인중심접근이 아닌 사 람중심 접근 방식을 통하여 집단 내의 다양한 잠재집단이 혼재할 수 있다는 것을 보고하는 연구들이 늘어나고 있다(Ha, Kim, & Kim, 2014). 이는 진정한 학습자중심교육으로 가기 위한 좋은 진단 연구들 이며, 이 연구에서도 최근 각광받고 있는 잠재집단분석법(latent class analysis)을 사용하여 공과대학 학생들 집단 내에 다양하게 형성되는 ‘융합에 대한 태도’에서의 잠재집단을 파악해 보고자 하였다. 따라서 이 연구의 목적은 공학전공대학생들의 융합에 대한 태도를 조사하고, 관련변인을 탐색하기 위함이다. 구체적인 연구 문제는 다음과 같다. 1) 고등학교 학생들을 대상으로 한 융합태도검사지의 신뢰도와 타 당도는 공학전공대학생에게도 높은 수준으로 나타나는가? 2) 공학전공대학생들의 융합에 대한 태도와 공학인증유무, 성별, 학년 간 관련성은 어떠한가? 3) 잠재집단분석을 통하여 확인한 공학전공대학생들은 융합에 대한 태도에 있어서 어떤 집단으로 구분될 수 있는가? 또한 융합에 대한 태도에 의하여 구분된 집단과 공학인증유무, 성별, 학년 간 관련성은 어떠한가?",,2017.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.14697/JKASE.2017.37.1.0113?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.14697/JKASE.2017.37.1.0113, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

895f0c587616583a66db2eb223f94b01549ed983,Challenges and Unexpected Affordances of Physical Computing Going Remote,"Engaging in physical computing activities involving both hardware and software provides a hands-on introduction to computer science. The move to remote learning for primary and secondary schools during the 2020-2021 school year due to COVID-19 made implementing physical computing activities especially challenging. However, it is important that these activities are not simply eliminated from the curriculum. This paper explores how a unit centered around students investigating how programmable sensors that can support data-driven scientific inquiry was collaboratively adapted for remote instruction. A case study of one teacher’s experience implementing the unit with a group of middle school students (ages 11 to 14) in her STEM elective class examines how her students could still engage in computational thinking practices around data and programming. The discussion includes both the challenges and unexpected affordances of engaging in physical computing activities remotely that emerged from her implementation.",International Conference on Interaction Design and Children,2021.0,5,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3459990.3460711', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3459990.3460711?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3459990.3460711, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The research aims to ascertain the perception that students at the Faculty of Education Sciences of the University of Granada have regarding the pedagogical model adopted in the virtual learning environment during confinement through the second semester of the 2019–2020 academic year. The information collection method was an online questionnaire, using simple random sampling with proportional affixing 0.5, 95% confidence level and maximum permissible error of 4.7%. The results demonstrate a generalised dissatisfaction of the students, being fundamental to carry out the transition of the educational processes and training of the teaching staff. The implementation of active methodologies increases due to the virtual condition, specifically the flipped classroom methodology, but students manifest generalised dissatisfaction regarding the adequate methodological development and the involvement of professors.

However, there is still no comprehensive bibliometrics study in the global publications on the application of Information Technology in COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the current research status of Information Technology in preventing and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Relevant literature published between 2020 and 2022 was downloaded from Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) databases. Key search terms included COVID-19, big data, artificial intelligence, internet of things, cloud computing, etc. The data elements were as follows: year, countries/territories, institutions, authors, journals, research areas and citations of publications. Statistical methods and knowledge domain maps were applied to conduct contribution and collaboration, co-occurrence and co-citation analysis using VOSviewer. COOC software was used to construct the two-mode matrix, conduct hierarchical cluster analysis of high-frequency keywords and journals, and identify keywords of bursts. Results: A total of 10,962 articles were retrieved. The most frequent country and institution were USA (2,423, 22.10%) and the University of California System (212, 1.934%), respectively.

f84df5777a43fa11004961e35e509a78b2fff094,Advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis in clinical practice—correspondence,"Dear Editor, Before the advent of the era of mobiles, medical technologies were primarily known as classic devices for medical purpose viz., stents, prosthetics, implants etc. The evolution of wearables, sensors along with smart phones and systems of communication has brought revolution in clinical practice with the ability to contain tools of artificial intelligence (AI) powered in tiny sizes. Certainly, AI has brought revolution in the medical sciences and can be understood commonly as the component of computer science capable of dealing with complex problems with several applications in areas with vast data. Intelligent AI-powered technologies in the medical field have made people enthusiastic partly due to its ability to enable a 4P’s model that indicate predictive, preventive, participatory and personalized. Successful application of AI in the field of radiology, dermatology and pathology is reflected with the speed of diagnosis exceeding that of experts in the medical field. Moreover, the accuracy of diagnosis through implementation of AI technologies is very high paralleling medical experts. Analysis of medical images viz., X-rays, ultrasounds, MRI, computerized tomography scans and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can be done through AI algorithms. This provides assistance to healthcare professionals for identification and diagnosis of diseases rapidly with more accuracy. Analysis of large amount of patient data can be done by AI. These data may be related to 2D/3D imaging in the medical field, bio signals (viz., electrocardiography, electroencephalography, electromyography etc), vital signs like temperature of the body, pulse rate, rate of respiration and blood pressure, information related to demography, medical history and results of laboratory test. By this way, the decision making process may be supported and provision of prediction results with accuracy is possible. The diversity of the data of patients in terms of multimodal data is a smart solution (optimal) that can facilitate diagnostic decisions in a better way on the basis of more than one finding in images, signals, representation in text form etc. By integration of more than one data sources, the diagnosticians can gain a better understanding of the health of the patient in a comprehensive manner and the underlying root causes in relation to the symptoms of the diseases can also be understood. The chances of misdiagnosis also get minimized in that way. Healthcare providers can be helped by multimodal data which help them in better diagnosis and monitoring of the progress of a clinical condition over time. This allows therapeutic management of chronic illnesses in a more effective way. By the use of medical data (multimodal), the explainable AI (XAI)-based diagnosticians can determine potential problems of health at an early stage before the condition becomes grave and threatens life of the patient. Further, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) (AI-powered) provides assistance in real-time and ensures support to make informed decisions about care of the patient in a better way. Automation of routine tasks is possible through application of XAI tools. This frees the healthcare professionals for focusing on more complex care of patients. One of the earliest applications of AI in clinical practice is the detection of atrial fibrillation at an early stage. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved AliveCor in the year 2014 for their mobile application Kardia. This allows monitoring of electrocardiogram (smart phone based) and helps in detecting atrial fibrillation. Approval of a software program had been done by the FDA in the year 2020 allowing medical professionals to perform ultrasound imaging of heart without any special training. It utilizes AI for providing real-time guidance and also has the capability of saving images of diagnostic quality. It acts as a co-pilot for the people who perform an ultrasound scan and can give instructions on the mechanisms involved in manipulating the transducer. Moreover, automated feedback on the image quality of diagnostic importance is also provided. Several AI-based techniques viz. machine as well as deep learning models are being used by researchers for detecting the diseases of heart, skin, liver, Alzheimer’s disease, which requires early diagnosis. Machine learning has an added value for processing of image where identification of early signs of disease through classical tools is not possible. This is especially true for cancer, the diagnosis of which frequently requires assistance of AI approaches.

6e704f9894a91591665b661954c28f0b5bcfd4c4,Student Retention and Success in an RN-BSN Program: Determining Variables and Methods,"Background The Online Registered Nurse to Baccalaureate Science in Nursing (RN- BSN) Program has a retention rate of close to 97.5% (UTEP, 2020). Attrition rates in nursing programs are high. The National League for Nursing (NLN) last reported a 25 % attrition rate which may double for minority students in four-year nursing programs (NLN, 2014; Elkin, 2019). As online courses in colleges and universities are growing and are predicted to become mainstream by 2025, it is essential to identify factors contributing to our retention rates. American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) has made it part of its 2021-2022 policy priorities to increase access to nursing programs (AACN, 2021). Objective The purpose of this study was to ascertain the factors affecting nursing student retention. The information was used to make changes to the existing online programs in our school and better support our students. The research question was “What factors do students identify that influenced their RN to BSN program retention?” Methodology The participants were chosen using a convenience sampling technique. The university was a public institution located in a border town. Three types of questions were asked: (1) general demographic information, (2) nursing career, and (3) program requirements for the RNBSN. Results A total of 33 participants completed the RN-BSN retention program study. The findings indicated that several general factors contribute to retention and student success, including student support services, mandatory orientation programs for students and faculty, credit student success courses, remedial academic ability programs (which discuss support services, particularly computer tech support), and recognizing the importance of diversity in the classroom and at work. Conclusion Examining the characteristics of distance education students, as well as their distinct abilities and needs, may assist schools in improving student retention. Reconsidering the characteristics and unique features of distance learning students may help schools retain students with a variety of needs, such as access to scholarships, loans, and financial incentives to continue their education.",European Journal of Educational Sciences,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.19044/ejes.v9no2a107', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.19044/ejes.v9no2a107?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.19044/ejes.v9no2a107, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b56f8d0fc2fd60cae0c50466208d219de58f2348,Health Silk Road 2020: A Bridge to the Future of Health for All,"The outbreak of the Coronavirus crisis at the end of 2019 has led to a surprise acceleration and expansion of the HSR and a boom in studies of this topic by global financial press, think tanks and universities. The team from China Investment Research (CIR), Grisons Peak, a London based consultancy focused primarily on emerging markets with a specific focus on the BRI, and the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS), a leading foreign policy think tank based in Shanghai, collaborate for the third time . 
 
Our major findings include the following: Firstly, China had already significantly scaled up medical assistance in various forms and secured the operation of medical supply chain for the world. At the World Health Assembly in May, President Xi promised a series of measures in helping with the world deal with the COVID-19, including providing US$2 billion assistance over two years, ensuring security and efficiency of anti-epidemic supply chains by establishing global humanitarian response depot and hub in China in collaboration with the UN, pairing up Chinese hospitals with 30 African hospitals, accelerating construction of African CDC headquarters, and providing Chinese-developed vaccine as global public good, etc.. The pledges are being delivered. By October of 2020, China had provided assistance to 150 countries and seven international organizations and exported over 179 billion masks, 1.73 billion protective suits, and 543 million testing kits. At present, 46 resident Chinese medical teams are in Africa helping with COVID-19 containment efforts, such as in Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea and Zimbabwe. China Development Bank and the two new multilateral development banks with China being the most important shareholder, i.e., Asian Infrastructure Development Bank and the New Development Bank, provided billions of timely COVID-19 related loans abroad. 
 
Secondly, Chinese companies accelerated “going out” in both volume and value in the health sector while the aggregate outbound investment has been declining. While it is true that Chinese announced outbound equity investments have declined annually since the 2016 peak, both deal volume and aggregate amounts in healthcare have increased substantially over the past 2 years. The number of investments more than doubled from 22 in the first quarter of 2019 to 52 in the third quarter of 2020, while the value increased even more significantly from 390.5 million US Dollars to 2.72 billion US Dollars in the same period. Despite the rising concerns on the “decoupling” of China and US technological development, slightly over 50% of the 224 Chinese outbound healthcare investments during this period had some involvement with the USA, even though such investments were virtually all minority investments and/or small components of much larger primarily USA-led VC/PE syndicates. Considering the background of rising geopolitical tensions, this represents a structural trend of Chinese firms’ outbound investment in following the model of the two tech giants Tencent and Alibaba and taking small stakes via growth capital. Biotech increased to about half of these investments in some quarters from 20-25% in early of this period. 
 
Thirdly, bio-tech and bio-pharma companies also became the most active components in Chinese capital market, which dwarfed many FDI inbound sector amounts. Strong developments in capital, technology and markets have enabled China to play a bigger role in maintaining global health. While company formation declined in other major markets such as the US, Europe, and Japan, the number of new Chinese biopharma companies has risen steadily over the past three decades, accelerating dramatically in the last ten years. More than 140 new biotech companies emerged in China from 2010 to 2020. Fueled by an ever-growing demand for healthcare, healthcare/life sciences is expected to be a long-term driving force of the A-share IPO market of China. During 2018-2019, the three major Chinese stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, relaxed their rules or launched new platforms, such as the Science and Technology Innovation Market (STAR) in Shanghai, in allowing companies has yet to earn a profit to raise funds via initial public offerings (IPOs), providing a significant boom to drug developers. By the end of the period, life sciences IPOs were among the most active in all of these exchanges. Shares in the 29 biotech companies that listed in Hong Kong since mid-2018 until 13 December 2020 — 27 of which are Chinese — rose by 53% on average from their IPO prices, according to Dealogic. This is also paving the way for Chinese capital market to become the world’s largest biotech fundraising hubs. Hong Kong plans to overtake NASDAQ as the world’s largest biotech fundraising centre by 2025. 
 
Fourthly, China provides vaccines around the world in a ""public product"" manner and has played an integral role in global vaccine development and distribution. China published the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in mid-January triggering a global R&D activity to develop a vaccine. The first COVID-19 vaccine candidate entered human clinical testing with unprecedented rapidity on 16 March 2020. By mid-year 2020, there were five Chinese biotech companies active in the COVID vaccine space that were publicly listed: CanSino Biologics, Sinopharm and its vaccine and bioscience subsidiary the China National Biotec Group Co Ltd (CNBG), Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products, Fosun Pharma, and Sichuan Clover. By the third quarter of 2020, China had been piloting vaccines in 16 developing countries around the world, beyond the narrowly defined “BRI countries”. In the fourth quarter, two of China’s 5 vaccines being trialed were approved, less than 3 weeks after the vaccines from the world’s largest and more established biopharma firms. Approved Chinese vaccines were sent for use in Bahrain, Chile, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Turkey and UAE, while agreements were signed with Brazil, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan and Ukraine and similar agreements were under review in Bangladesh, Jordan, Malaysia, Philippines and Peru. Chinese vaccines provide reasonable alternates for lower-and middle-income countries that cannot provide the extensive cold storage network required for the distribution of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. It is most noteworthy that Chinese private sector has been playing an active role in the process. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Cainiao announced its partnership with Ethiopian Airlines to launch a special cold chain air freight to transport temperature-controlled medicines twice a week from Shenzhen to Africa, and to the rest of the world via Dubai and Addis Ababa.",,2021.0,5,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/SSRN.3830380?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/SSRN.3830380, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Robotics has been taught at our institution for four years with enrollment growing each year. Our program is part of the undergraduate Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and has an equal focus on robotics theory and practice, with the “Robot Operating System” (ROS) running on students' own computers, and a small robotics learning lab with a variety of ROS based robots. Our pandemic experience during 2020 led us to invest in a cloud-based shared “cloud” environment running on a Kubernetes cluster. We learned that there are real advantages to this in terms of scale and geographical reach. The success of this with our students, our Covid experience, preparation for teaching in our lab, and planning towards return to campus led directly to this work-in-progress paper, where we define, in one abstraction, a remote/virtual robotics learning lab, unifying local and remote access to both simulated and real robots.

Students of the subject had to learn how to prepare simple web pages, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages. To this end, flipped classroom technique was used to present the necessary contents, combined with an adaptation of Aronson's cooperative learning puzzle technique, used to carry out a group practice that reflected the knowledge acquired. It is worth mentioning, as a complement to the two techniques used, the use of an adapted assessment rubric, which was provided to the students at the beginning of the teaching block. The evaluation was carried out during two consecutive academic years, 2018/2019 and 2019/2020. There were important differences between the two studies: in the first study, students' previous self-assigned level was much higher (2.8 points as opposed to 1.4 points on a scale of 1 to 5). The other difference, even more relevant, was that in the second year all teaching was done at home, in a non-attendance format, on a mandatory basis, due to the period of confinement decreed by the state of alarm at that moment, because of the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, popularly known as coronavirus. It is remarkable that, despite these differences, the students expressed their satisfaction with the learning acquired and with the tasks performed in both cases. The techniques used were well-appreciated, in first year more than in the second, and especially flipped classroom.

e1c709cc4e188981cdcccec78b82eb845d5470c8,Moving MSc Software Development course online: adaptation of the large class module to a distance learning model,"The Covid-19 pandemic brought dramatic changes to higher education settings, particularly for curriculum delivery, moving quickly to online learning in March 2020, which for many was the first experience of teaching and learning in the virtual environment.This paper discusses the experience of redesigning the MSc Computing Foundations module and adapting it to a distance learning model using both synchronous and asynchronous delivery at the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen’s University Belfast in response to the challenges brought to higher education by the pandemic. The module is a fundamental compulsory module with an intake of 100+ students in the part-time class studying the conversional MSc course in Software Development.This paper focuses on the challenges and opportunities faced by large class students during this unprecedented move online, and changes made to the curriculum to facilitate the move to online teaching and learning using the conceptual framework for effective online courses. The paper reflects on student feedback to online educational activities including synchronous and asynchronous content delivery, discussion forums, ungraded formative quizzes, formative and summative assessments delivered online for a postgraduate cohort studying part-time. Sustained level of student engagement was evidenced through statistics collected from the virtual learning environment.This paper further discusses how the above has transformed teaching of the Computing Foundations module for the large cohort, focusing on the student experience only, and reflecting on how these online teaching practices contribute to provision of education with a view what developments became a success and could be turn to advantage and what was not effective and should be eliminated post-pandemic. Adaptation of the Computing Foundation module to the new model of online delivery has been successful in the 2020-2021 academic year, and the module has become a distance module delivered fully online in the 2021-2022 academic year. The transformation has helped to cope with a ""new normal"" in an increasingly hybrid higher education ecosystem as students’ and educators’ involvement into learning activities continued to be altered in the post-pandemic society.",2022 31st Annual Conference of the European Association for Education in Electrical and Information Engineering (EAEEIE),2022.0,3,"{'url': 'https://pure.qub.ac.uk/files/335217873/OPishchukhina_EAEEIE2022.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'other-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/eaeeie54893.2022.9820299?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/eaeeie54893.2022.9820299, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8691625079c59a696acc8acf00bf5875167865e9,Euclid. III. The NISP instrument,"The Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) on board the satellite provides multiband photometry and $R slitless grism spectroscopy in the 950--2020\,nm wavelength range. In this reference article, we illuminate the background of NISP's functional and calibration requirements, describe the instrument's integral components, and provide all its key properties. We also sketch the processes needed to understand how NISP operates and is calibrated as well as its technical potentials and limitations. Links to articles providing more details and the technical background are included. The NISP's 16 H2RG detectors with a plate scale of $ deliver a field of view of 0.57\,deg$^2$. In photometric mode, NISP reaches a limiting magnitude of sim \,24.5\,AB\,mag in three photometric exposures of about 100\,s in exposure time for point sources and with a S/N of five. For spectroscopy, NISP's point-source sensitivity is a SNR = 3.5 detection of an emission line with flux sim \,$2 $ integrated over two resolution elements of 13.4\ in 3times 560\,s grism exposures at 1.6\ (redshifted Halpha ). Our calibration includes on-ground and in-flight characterisation and monitoring of the pixel-based detector baseline, dark current, non-linearity, and sensitivity to guarantee a relative photometric accuracy better than 1.5 and a relative spectrophotometry better than 0.7. The wavelength calibration must be accurate to 5\ or better. The NISP is the state-of-the-art instrument in the near-infrared for all science beyond small areas available from HST and JWST -- and it represents an enormous advance from any existing instrumentation due to its combination of field size and high throughput of telescope and instrument. During six-year survey covering 14\,000\,deg$^2$ of extragalactic sky, NISP will be the backbone in determining distances of more than a billion galaxies.

c7c446b83ca5b903f1d8b70e9fc8bdeb2e5a6bdb,Training Teaching Assistants by Offering an Introductory Course,"Teaching assistants (TAs) are often used in computer science (CS) courses to conduct tutorials in smaller groups and to be able to provide students with one-to-one help sessions. TAs can also assist with the assessment, which can be time-consuming in large classes. Previous research does, however, indicate that TAs can be poorly prepared for their work tasks. In this experience report, we present a TA training course that addresses this issue and prepares new TAs for their responsibilities. This includes conducting tutorials, tutoring and providing students with useful feedback in lab settings, and conducting assessments. In addition, we also aimed at creating a safe space for our TAs to discuss challenges and fears that they foresee or have already experienced as TAs. To do this, we developed an introductory course consisting of five modules, that are based on previous research on TAs in CS and in the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework. The modules are: HR questions, classroom teaching, helping and supervising in lab sessions, assessment, and reflection and discussion. The course is given in a blended learning format, where the first three modules are student-paced online modules, while the last two are synchronous meetings. To evaluate the training, we present course evaluation results from 53 TAs who enrolled in this 6-hours course during the 2020/2021 academic year. We conclude that this TA training course has been well appreciated by almost all the participants, discuss lessons learned and future plans.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2022.0,16,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3478431.3499270', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3478431.3499270?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3478431.3499270, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A systematic review was performed for articles published, for the 10-year period (June 2010 to June 2020), without restrictions as to location and language, using the Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science databases. The terms used in the search strategies were ""phonological"", ""phonetic"", ""transcription"", ""computer"" and ""software"". The studies were selected by two independent reviewers using pre-defined search strategies. In the initial search, after the exclusion of duplicates, 534 articles were found. By reading their titles and abstracts, 46 articles related to the theme were left, which were then read in full. After reading, 24 articles were included in the study. The results revealed a total of seven software available for the phonetic transcription of spontaneous speech from preschoolers used for different analyses: LENA and Timestamper (for babbling and pre-linguistic vocalizations), ELAN (for gestural communication, extralinguistic elements and the situational context), Phon (for phonetic and phonological analyses), CLAN and SALT (for morphosyntactic, grammatical and semantic aspects) and Praat (for acoustic measurements). Through this systematic review, it can be concluded that there are advantages to using software for phonetic transcription, sample storage, and child language analysis, especially concerning standardization and reliability for spontaneous speech samples. Phonetic transcription still relies on the ability and subjectivity of a human transcriber. The tools found in the software provide support to facilitate using phonetic symbols, audio segmentation and pairing to writing, and analysis of speech data.",Revista da Abralin,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://revista.abralin.org/index.php/abralin/article/download/2057/2674', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.25189/rabralin.v21i1.2057?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.25189/rabralin.v21i1.2057, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e9c7dba5fc09087b1e2cd3f499bb84b4a773cf41,A Blended-Learning Program for Implementing a Rigorous Machine-Learning Curriculum in High-Schools,"AI, and, more specifically, deep learning, is profoundly impacting our industries and societies [1]. In recent years, machine learning (ML) 's surging impact has sparked discourse about the importance of AI education for young people, and in recent years, several initiatives and projects pursuing the mission of K-12 AI education have emerged. In 2020 Israel's Ministry of Education (MoE) approved a new comprehensive and rigorous ML curriculum targeting 11 and 12th-grade pupils majoring in computer science (CS). The curriculum is meant to be taught by the existing CS teacher workforce. However, since ML theory and practice are fundamentally different from traditional CS [2], implementing this thorough ML curriculum poses substantial challenges in developing an effective teaching workforce to deliver it. In this research, we suggest a solution for this challenge in the form of a blended-learning (BL) program. The online component of this program is based mainly on Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization MOOCs series [3]. The BL program, enhanced with pedagogical training, is also used for the professional development (PD) of the teachers who deliver the program. Out of fourteen CS teachers who participated in the PD in the summer of 2021, ten teach the BL program this year to 273 high-school pupils. Initial results demonstrate the achievement of the curriculum learning goals and provide compelling preliminary evidence that this program enables CS teachers who are new to machine learning to teach this thorough curriculum effectively",ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,2022.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3491140.3528291?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3491140.3528291, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d4ddb175a1f6e0f23e8d1b0304cc1ab1ba0aeeca,Pedagogy in a Pandemic: Teaching without Exams,"Due to the pandemic lockdown, York University’s Fall 2020 offerings of a pair of 1st and 2nd year undergraduate engineering and computer science courses were heavily modified to accommodate a completely online approach to teaching. The objective was to maximize interactivity and hands-on elements while also providing a supportive and authentic learning experience. Class presentations were made asynchronous by uploading them to YouTube and superimposing H5P elements via our Moodle-based LMS. Our traditional laboratory equipment was replaced with inexpensive lab kits that were obtained from commercial vendors and shipped to students via the university’s Bookstore. All tests, quizzes and exams were eliminated in both courses. Instead, a specifications-based assessment approach was taken, with all students given the opportunity to achieve a B+ if they completed all the work in the class. Students who wished to submit a final project could do so for an opportunity to boost their grade to A or A+. Most intra-semester deadlines were removed, with material associated with the synchronous lab sessions being the notable exception. The resulting grade distribution and averages were similar to previous years inwhich we relied to in-person testing. The rate of A/A+ was 21% and 8%, while the failure rate was 13% and 3% , respectively, for the first and second year classes. Informal feedback from students, including those with academic accommodations, was nearly universally positive, with most acknowledging that their stress levels were lower, making the learning more manageable. 
En raison de la crise sanitaire et le confinement COVID19, deux cours d’ingénierie de 1`ere et 2`eme année de l’université York ont été modifiés pour s’adapter à une approche d’enseignement entièrement numérique. L’objectif des adaptations était de permettre aux étudiants d’apprendre du matériel technique de manière pratique et interactive sur internet. Les présentations en classe ont été rendues interactives et asynchrones en les téléchargeant sur YouTube et en superposant des ressources H5P via notre environnement numérique d’apprentissage Moodle. Nos équipements de laboratoire traditionnel ont été remplacé par des kits de laboratoire abordables obtenus auprès de fournisseurs commerciaux et expédies aux étudiants via la librairie de l’université. Nous avons éliminé tous les tests, questionnaires et examens dans les deux cours. Une approche basée sur les spécifications a été adoptée, permettant les élèves d’obtenir un B+ s’ils terminent tous les travaux de la classe. Les étudiants qui souhaitaient un A ou A+ devaient soumettre un projet final. La plupart des délais intra-semestriels ont été supprimés, le matériel associé aux sessions de laboratoire synchrones étant l’exception notable. La distribution des notes et les moyennes étaient similaires aux années au cours desquelles nous nous sommes appuyés sur des tests en personne. Le taux de A / A + était de 21% et 8%, tandis que le taux d’échec était de 13% et 3%, respectivement, pour les classes de premières et deuxièmes années.

Settings and Design: This systematic review conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Review and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Materials and Methods: A systematic electronic literature search was conducted through PubMed, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central), and Science direct. A hand search was also performed for individual journals and reference lists of selected studies. Randomized controlled clinical trials and crossover clinical trials from 2010 to 2020 with follow up of more than 1 year were included. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used for assessing the risk of bias of included studies. Statistical Analysis Used: The statistical meta analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan) [computer program]. Version 5.4. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboation, 2020. Results: Six studies that met the inclusion criteria possess the low risk of bias with follow up of more than 1 year were included in this systematic review. Out of four outcomes, meta analysis was performed for prosthodontic maintenance and peri implant tissue changes. Due to the limited availability of data, retention and patient satisfaction were reviewed systematically without meta analysis. The result of meta analysis for ball versus magnet attachment showed statistically significant differences in prosthodontic complications and maintenance, and ball attachment reported fewer complications than the locator attachment (risk ratio [RR] =0.55, confidence interval [CI] =95%, P = 0.03). Peri implant tissue changes were analyzed in the included studies as probing depth and marginal bone loss. The result of meta analysis for probing depth showed no statistically significant difference between bar versus telescopic type of attachment (RR = 0.20, CI = 95%, P = 0.74). The meta analysis results for marginal bone loss showed no statistically significant difference between bar versus telescopic type of attachment (mean difference = 0.35, CI = 95%, P = 0.10). Conclusion: It can be concluded from the current review that bar attachment provided the most superior retention. The telescopic attachment system not only showed the most favorable patient's satisfaction but also reported the least peri implant mucosal changes.

On the other hand, the year 2020 just passed saw the increase of IM operational systems: in addition to the two historical systems, CLOMON2 (University of Pisa/SpaceDyS) and Sentry (JPL/NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) started its own system AstOD. Moreover, in the last five years three systems for the detection of imminent impactors (small asteroidal objects detected a few days before the possible impact with the Earth) have been developed: SCOUT (at JPL/NASA), NEORANGER (at University of Helsinki) and NEOScan (at University of Pisa/SpaceDyS). The IM science, in addition to being useful for the planetary protection, is a very fascinating field of research because it involves astronomy, physics, mathematics and computer science. In this paper I am going to review the mathematical tools and algorithms of the IM science, highlighting the historical evolution and the challenges to be faced in the future.",Universe,2021.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/7/4/103/pdf?version=1618568246', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/UNIVERSE7040103?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/UNIVERSE7040103, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

598d79eb176eecb607a2ec1fbe0f1a8b62ed7588,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the influence of STAS on the long-term prognosis of stage I lung adenocarcinoma,"Background The appearance of airway dissemination often indicates poor prognosis of lung cancer. However, the relationship between airway dissemination and early lung adenocarcinoma is not clear. Therefore, this study uses meta-analysis to study the long-term prognosis of patients with early lung adenocarcinoma. Methods A computer search of the PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, and other databases was conducted, and the search time limit was from the establishment of the database to December 30, 2020. Data strictly in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria was extracted and the quality of the included literature was evaluated. Two reviewers then independently screened the literature and evaluated the risk of bias. Results A total of 11 studies were included, comprised of 5,097 patients with early lung adenocarcinoma. The results of the meta-analysis showed that among patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma, the 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of STAS-positive patients was lower than those of the STAS-negative group, and the difference was statistically significant. In the control study, the 5-year RFS was HR =1.95, 95% CI (1.58–2.31) P<0.01, and the 5-year OS was OR =2.04, 95% CI (1.60–2.48) P<0.01, and in STAS-positive patients, sublobectomy had a worse long-term prognosis than lobectomy. While the 5-year RFS HR of the lobectomy group was 1.82, 95% CI (1.43–2.22), and the 5-year RFS HR of the sublobectomy group was 6.92, 95% CI (1.64–12.18) P<0.01, the prognosis of the STAS-positive high-expression group and the low-expression group was worse. The 5-year RFS HR of the low-expression STAS group was 2.93, 95% CI (0.21–6.07), and in the high expression group this was 8.20, 95% CI (0.55–15.85) P<0.05. Discussion STAS is an independent risk factor for the poor prognosis of stage I lung adenocarcinoma and a high expression of STAS results in a higher 5-year recurrence rate. When STAS is positive, the sublobectomy method should be carefully selected. However, our research has certain limitations, such as literature selection and publication bias. At the same time, the depth of literature analysis needs to be further improved.",Translational Cancer Research,2021.0,7,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.21037/tcr-21-750', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8797706, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ. Data extraction is the process of a systematic review that occurs between identifying eligible studies and analysing the data, whether it can be a qualitative synthesis or a quantitative synthesis involving the pooling of data in a metaanalysis. The aims of data extraction are to obtain information about the included studies in terms of the characteristics of each study and its population and, for quantitative synthesis, to collect the necessary data to carry out metaanalysis. In systematic reviews, information about the included studies will also be required to conduct risk of bias assessments, but these data are not the focus of this article. Following good practice when extracting data will help make the process efficient and reduce the risk of errors and bias. Failure to follow good practice risks basing the analysis on poor quality data, and therefore providing poor quality inputs, which will result in poor quality outputs, with unreliable conclusions and invalid study findings. In computer science, this is known as ‘garbage in, garbage out’ or ‘rubbish in, rubbish out’. Furthermore, providing insufficient information about the included studies for readers to be able to assess the generalisability of the findings from a systematic review will undermine the value of the pooled analysis. Such failures will cause your systematic review and metaanalysis to be less useful than it ought to be.",BMJ evidence-based medicine,2021.0,57,"{'url': 'https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:57afbdd7-9d8b-4a5a-984f-5427a7b68efa/files/rr207tp62r', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1136/bmjebm-2020-111651?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2020-111651, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To gain an understanding of the nuances of this concept, it is enough to delve into just one topic of elementary school mathematics curriculum. Select an arbitrarily unit segment, build two segments with lengths of ordinary fractions with different denominators and make sure that it is impossible to compare them in length in numerical terms. Then, appreciate the remarkable ability of Mathematics, to provide a solution to what would otherwise appear to be an insoluble problem. 

In the educational process, it is essential to differentiate between the state and the student. The first provides the opportunity to obtain knowledge, but is not to answer for the second. However, there must be moral and material motivation to obtain high-quality knowledge. In his teachings, wise Abay cautioned that the word from the educated though demanding, can illuminate the path to understanding. He urged to perceive the light and mystery that surrounds us. With his words ""Aitshy-aytshyp zhalynar, Uqqysh zhansyp shabynar. Uqpay zhatyp zhalyǵar, uıqyly-oıaý boıkúıez"", which translates as ‘mindless boredom, drowsiness’, he emphasised the importance of remaining alert and awake to the world around us. In the absence of boredom, sleepiness"", as in the case of personal transformation of the individual and the principle of ""you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink"". 

The concept of ""Justice"" is a multifaceted topic in the International Educational Space. It is the universal division between ""Global North"" and the ""Global South"", where the former has a stronger economy, infrastructure and technology, while the latter is characterized by less diverse economy, by poverty and inequality and a history of colonization by the countries of the Global North. These studies adopt from various points of views: sociological, economic, pedagogical, legal and political, as well as various professional approaches such as ""Fair education from the standpoint of textbook quality"" or ""Development and implementation of programs that take into account the needs of different groups of students"", ""Evaluation of the effectiveness of pedagogical strategies aimed at eliminating educational inequality"", and ""The role of technology in providing access to education"", etc.

9295e437360d1ce746ffaba949bc1ccc1e73ac84,Precursors of Cloud Computing Adoption in Selected Banks in Kenya,"Purpose: The study analyzed the precursors of adoption of cloud computing in selected banks in Kenya. Specifically, the study sought to establish the effect of data security on adoption of cloud computing in selected banks in Kenya, to establish how organizational culture affects adoption of cloud computing in selected banks in Kenya, to establish how supplier lock- in affects adoption of cloud computing in selected banks in Kenya and to establish how regulatory policy affects adoption of cloud computing in selected banks in Kenya. 
Methodology: The study employed descriptive research design and inferential statistics. The target population was 366 ICT staff from 3 selected banks namely NCBA, KCB Bank and Equity bank. The selected banks had the largest market share according to published CBK supervisory report for year 2020. The sample size was 191 respondents. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Responses in the questionnaires were tabulated, coded and processed by use of a computer statistical package for social sciences version 28 (SPSS) program to analyze the data. The responses from the open-ended questions were listed to obtain proportions appropriately and then reported by descriptive narrative. Descriptive statistics like mean, standard deviation were used. The ANOVA test was used to establish the findings from the study and results presented in graphs and charts. 
Findings: Cloud computing adoption was evaluated for the select commercial banks across three areas namely core-banking systems, middle office and compliance systems and back-office, data science and innovation systems over a period of five years. The respondents indicated that no more than one cloud computing project was either in planning, implementation, failed or completed stages, indicating that despite the perceived benefits of cloud computing there are precursors that need to be addressed if the commercial banks are to fully embrace cloud computing. 
Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: In terms of policy, the  findings of the study will be important to regulators like CA, CBK and other institutions that regulate financial institutions in coming up with relevant guidelines when it comes to handling customer data within Cloud Computing environment. It gives banking sector perspective of some of the issues that require attention if the envisaged benefits of clod computing are to be fully realized. This is important not only to the policy makers but also to the cloud service providers . Additionally, the findings give a theoretical basis of validating the antecedents of cloud computing adoption in the banking sector in Kenya and this can be extended to the rest of the world. The findings give a practical perspective of the real concerns the banks have to contend with from a practical perspective and therefore very critical in advancement of cloud computing technologies.",International journal of technology and systems,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.iprjb.org/journals/index.php/IJTS/article/download/1676/1734', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47604/ijts.1676?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47604/ijts.1676, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Isolation of those relating to the problem forecasting the development of pests and pathogens of plant diseases in agrocenoses of Ukraine. 
Results. The concept of formation of the phytosanitary state of crops and plantations under the conditions of climate change has been developed. The theory of the dynamics of the number of locusts and the prediction of emergency situations in the agricultural sphere of Ukraine has been developed. The widespread use of pheromone traps for diagnosing the phytosanitary state of agrocenoses of Ukraine is recommended. The cyclicity of outbreaks of mass reproduction of the Anisoplia austriaca beetle and the European corn borer was established, depending on the amount of solar activity. The possibility of applying GIS-technologies for the analysis of long-term data was studied. Predictive computer programs (models) of harvest shortages of rapeseed, sunflower, corn, sugar beet, and winter wheat from a complex of pests have been developed. An algorithm for the application of information technology programs for the analysis of multi-year dynamics of the phytosanitary state of agrocenoses has been developed. The role of the developed computer model of the development of leaf spots of grain crops in determining the moment for the most effective application of fungicides has been established. Methods of forecasting the development of pathogens of grape diseases in the South of Ukraine have been developed. A system of forecasting the phytosanitary state of agrocenoses of Ukraine in the conditions of the year and planning the implementation of protective measures has been developed. 
Conclusions. Innovative developments of the Scientific and Methodological Center «Plant Protection» make it possible to solve the following issues at a modern level: forecasting changes in the agrosphere based on the analysis of a long-term database of hydrothermal conditions and indicators of the phytosanitary state of agrocenoses; prevention of emergency situations in the agricultural sector on the basis of a modern monitoring system using GPS-navigation and the development of regulations for carrying out protective measures; forecasting the development of dangerous pests and diseases of agricultural crops; forecasting crop failures and determining the economic feasibility of chemical plant protection; forecasting the appearance and spread of quarantine pests.",Interdepartmental Thematic Scientific Collection of Phytosanitary safety,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://zkr.ipp.gov.ua/index.php/journal/article/download/210/211', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.36495/1606-9773.2023.69.338-347?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.36495/1606-9773.2023.69.338-347, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Persistent Homology is an algebraic method used in topological data analysis for measuring shapes and functions. This paper aimed to analyze literature on Persistent Homology. From its inception (2004) to 6th November 2020, we comprehensively searched the Scopus science database. This paper records the document and source types, year of publication, languages of documents, subject areas, author’s keywords, country/region, authors, institutions, and citations, utilizing standard bibliometric indicators. The VOSviewer applications were used for analysis through various network forms. Two network measurements were considered to analyze the network model, which are degree centrality and betweenness centrality. Additional analysis was undertaken using Persistent Homology itself to comprehend the co-authorship network better. The study found that the number of Persistent Homology research has risen dramatically since 2014. Globally, scholars in the area mainly come from the United States. Regarding the number of citations, with an average of 51.2 citations each year, the paper by Zomorodian and Carlsson (2005) appears as the most cited article. Much of the study on Persistent Homology was in the fields of computer science and mathematics. The most used keywords were “topological features” and “data handling”, which reflect the significant study fields covered in Persistent Homology. Overall, the increasing number of Persistent Homology publications reflects a growing knowledge of its meaning and unique demands.",Malaysian Journal of Fundamental and Applied Sciences,2022.0,5,"{'url': 'https://mjfas.utm.my/index.php/mjfas/article/download/2418/1691', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.11113/mjfas.v18n4.2418?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.11113/mjfas.v18n4.2418, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

For the first time in recent history, countries closed schools and forced instructors and students to quickly adjust to online classes. This sudden and forced shift to a method of teaching that was completely different from what we were used to presented several challenges and opportunities on a pedagogical level. In this paper we describe our experience as instructors in a course on microprocessor programming in the Master's Degree in Computer Science and Computing Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto. Our approach included changes to the assessment plan, which became more distributed, and improvements in communication between students and instructors through the use of Slack.

In addition to this, the project provides the learners with an opportunity to demonstrate and showcase their critical thinking abilities and creativity. However, due to the year-long independent nature of these projects, learners can disengage due to a lack of motivation or self-regulated skills throughout the project. To address this problem, we formulated a data-driven intervention approach that conducts learner engagement analytics to identify and support disengaged learners, ensuring they maximise the benefits of completing a capstone project. The motivation was also to provide these learners with the necessary resources and support to get them back on track. This approach was implemented in the capstone projects conducted by learners at Queen Mary University of London within the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. Based on the data of the three cohorts in 2020–21, 2021–22 and 2022–23, our analysis shows that the proposed data-driven intervention approach for capstone projects can effectively identify less-engaged learners and targeted interventions are shown to improve the overall performance of these less-engaged learners on capstone projects.",IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578897?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578897, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD) as an instructional tool that can identify at-risk first-year engineering students. The purpose of this study is to provide construct validity, internal consistency reliability, item characteristics, and criterion validity evidence for this diagnostic. From fall 2020 to fall 2021, 469 students from three institutions in the United States took the diagnostic. The data from 152 students at one institution was used to provide evidence of predictive validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 20 items loading onto one factor in a good model fit range, with the internal consistency reliability coefficient, Cronbach $\alpha $ of 0.86. From item analyses based on classical test theory, the diagnostic items on average tended to be slightly easy but had sufficient discrimination power. The correlation matrix for criterion validity evidence indicated that the diagnostic functions well to differentiate students’ computational thinking ability by prior computer science course experience as well as by first-generation status. Predictive validity evidence from regression analyses revealed the statistically significant effect of students’ diagnostic scores assessed at the beginning of the first semester on predicting their end of semester course grades. The ECTD can have a broad impact because it provides a tool to gauge the entry-level skills of students, enabling early curriculum interventions to help retention and persistence to graduation.

International data corporation (IDC) found that there will be 80 billion connected devices in 2025, helping generate 180 trillion gigabytes of new data that year. The amount of data from the IoT that is analyzed and used to change business processes will be as significant in 2025 as all the data created in 2020. Current solutions mainly depend on cloud and edge computing that necessitate high-performance servers and distributed computing resources to provide storage and computation services. However, the current IoT-based framework manifests many drawbacks, especially security and privacy issues, which significantly impedes its broad adoption. Thus, developing new protection methods is an urgent topic for IoT to solve the security and privacy issues in the current IoT frameworks. Several new techniques (such as blockchain and machine learning) have recently emerged as a potential technology to deal with privacy issues and design new computing frameworks for IoT. Nevertheless, there is no consensus toward any schemes or best practices to describe how these techniques could be used in IoT security and privacy. Investigating privacy and secure models and methods for IoT issues is still an important challenge. To address these arising challenges and opportunities different from traditional IoT-based architecture, all the papers chosen for this special issue represent recent progress in the field of security and privacy techniques relevant to the convergence of IoT, including Authentication and Key Exchange, Data security, Machine Learning Security, and Application of Secure IoT. Overall, our international editorial committee selected 21 papers from both the theoretical and the practical side.

Memory and storage chipmaker Micron announced as much as $100 billion for a new plant in upstate NewYork. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), which was already building a $12 billion fab in Arizona, upped the investment to $40 billion with a second plant. Samsung is planning a $17 billion fab near Austin, Texas, and in September Intel broke ground on the first of two massive new facilities worth $20 billion in central Ohio. ⊚ Exciting as this is for the U.S. economy, there's a potential problem: Where will the industry find the qualified workforce needed to run these plants and design the chips they'll make? The United States today manufactures just 12 percent ofthe world's chips, down from 37 percent in 1990, according to a September 2020 report by the Semiconductor Industry Association. Over those decades, experts say, semiconductor and hardware education has stagnated. But for the CHIPS Act to succeed, each fab will need hundreds of skilled engineers and technicians of all stripes, with training ranging from two-year associate degrees to Ph.D.s. ⊚ Engineering schools in the United States are now racing to produce that talent. Universities and community colleges are revamping their semiconductor-related curricula and forging strategic partnerships with one another and with industry to train the staff needed to run U.S. foundries. There were around 20,000 job openings in the semiconductor industry at the end of 2022, according to Peter Bermel, an electrical and computer engineering professor at Purdue University. “Even if there's limited growth in this field, you'd need a minimum of 50,000 more hires in the next five years.

This study aims at comparing the performance of second MBBS students in their internal assessment belonging to two consecutive batches with old curriculum (2018–2019 batch) comprising of 146 students and new curriculum (2019–2020 batch) comprising of 142 students. The impact of new MBBS curriculum on 2nd-year MBBS students in pharmacology subject was also assessed in this study. 

Aim and Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare the performance of the students in their internal assessment in two consecutive batches with old (2018–2019 batch) and new curriculum (2019–2020 batch). A questionnaire-based survey was done among (2019–2020) batch second MBBS students to find out the impact of new MBBS curriculum on second MBBS students in pharmacology subject. 

Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective, record-based, and comparative study done in the Department of Pharmacology, at Shadan Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, during September 2022–November 2022. The internal assessment marks were collected by retrieving the records of students and a questionnaire to assess the impact of new second MBBS curriculum on 2nd-year MBBS students in pharmacology subject was circulated among 142 students belonging to (2019–2020 batch) following the new curriculum. Out of 142 students, 111 students responded to this questionnaire. 

Results: The mean marks obtained by old curriculum (2018–2019 batch) in theory were 66.7 and in practical were 72.2, whereas the mean marks obtained by new curriculum (2019–2020 batch) in theory were 68.4 and in practical were 74.1. Nearly 60 (54.1%) students disliked and 51 (45.9%) students liked the shortening of second MBBS duration. Ninety-four (84.7%) students liked and 18 (16.2%) disliked skills laboratory and computer aided learning into the new curriculum, 52 (46.8%) students liked small group discussion, tutorials, seminars, and self-directed learning, whereas 61 (55%) students disliked them. Questions based on clinical problems and attitude, ethics, and communication were liked by 94 (84.7%) students and disliked by 17 (5.3%) students. Thirty-one (27.9%) students liked and 81 (73%) students disliked the new curriculum question paper. Seventy-six (68.5%) students liked and 36 (32.4%) students did not like the increase in duration of pharmacology question paper. Seventy-eight (70.3%) students preferred new curriculum, whereas 38 (34.2%) students preferred old curriculum. 

Conclusion: This study revealed relatively better performance of (2019–2020 batch), that is, new curriculum batch students in their internal assessment compared to (2018–2019 batch), that is, new curriculum batch students. To improve the performance of students in their internal as well as final summative examinations, there is a need to emphasize on assessment of attitude, communication skills, ethics, and faculty development program.",National Journal of Physiology Pharmacy and Pharmacology,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5455/njppp.2023.13.01026202318012023?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5455/njppp.2023.13.01026202318012023, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Every year at the same place and time. The exception was in 2020, when the world was gripped by the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement of people was severely restricted. After a year’s break, the conference is back on track. 2021 conference was successful, and the main objective of lively scientific communication was again achieved. The conference focuses on live interaction among participants, but there is also some scope for a limited number of virtual presentations. For better efficiency of communication among participants, most of the presentations are poster presentations. This format is really effective. 
The history of the conference goes back to 2009, when 16 papers were delivered. It started as a workshop and has now grown into a well-known conference. The idea of such workshop was conceived at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, which is now the Institute of Data Science and Digital Technologies of Vilnius University. The Lithuanian Academy of Sciences and the Lithuanian Computer Society supported this idea. This idea has been welcomed by the Lithuanian scientific community and abroad. The number of this year’s presentations is 81. The number of registered participants is 121 from 10 countries. This is significantly more than in 2021. The conference brings together researchers from six Lithuanian universities. This makes the conference the main annual meeting point for Lithuanian computer scientists. The main goal of the conference is to introduce the research undertaken at Lithuanian and foreign universities in the fields of data science and software engineering. The annual organization of the conference allows the fast interchanging of new ideas among the scientific community. Seven IT companies supported the conference this year. This means that the topics of the conference are actual for business, too. 
Topics of the conference cover Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Bioinformatics, Blockchain Technologies, Business Rules Software Engineering, Data Science, Deep Learning, Digital Technologies, High-Performance Computing, Machine Learning, Medical Informatics, Modelling Educational Data, Ontological Engineering, Optimization in Data Science, Signal Processing, Visualization Methods for Multidimensional Data.

Aligning with its mission to prepare students as global citizens for future career aspirations and lifelong learning through quality teaching, the American University in the Emirates (AUE) focuses on outcome-based education to ensure the employability of graduates and hence soon realized the significance of the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology-Computing Accreditation Commission (ABET-CAC) standard toward the Computer Science (CS) program. While pursuing ABET accreditation was challenging, the outcome was positive, and currently, the Computer Science Program, with its two specializations in Network Security and Digital Forensics is ABET-accredited. The process required support from all units within the institution and was a great learning experience for all stakeholders. ABET draws generic requirements to be fulfilled by a program seeking accreditation without a detailed procedure to achieve them. However, there is little information about achieving these requirements, especially criterion 4: continuous improvement, which most programs fail to comply with according to ABET. This study presented a comprehensive and reproducible methodology that addresses our successful efforts in aligning the CS program with ABET-CAC requirements by emphasizing criterion 4. This article reported the evaluation of Student Outcomes number one and two for the academic year 2020–2021 through a comprehensive framework. The framework showed data collection, data reporting and analysis, actions, and recommendations for the next academic cycle. The framework showed a mathematical model for calculating the Student Outcomes (SOs) attainment based on the mapped Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs). Finally, the recommendations were reported.

With its exceptional mechanical and biological properties, zirconia crown outperforms other traditional ceramic materials. With outstanding mechanical and biological qualities, zirconia has several therapeutic applications. Temperature, environment, diet, and smoking habits all affect colour and surface roughness of dental restorations. Aim: To investigate the colour stability and surface roughness of high translucency monolithic zirconia following immersion in various acidic solutions. Materials and Methods: This in-vitro study was conducted at Yenepoya Dental College, Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Duration of the study was 6 months, from December 2019 to June 2020. Thirty rectangular samples from a CAD (computer-aided Design)/ Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) machined Zirconia blank with 10x8x1 mm dimensions was sintered at 1350°C, tested for colour stability (E) and surface roughness prior to immersion (R). Classified into Groups CO (coffee), TO (tobacco) and CA (citric acid medium). Colour stability and surface roughness were re-evaluated post immersion on all samples using spectrophotometers and profilometer respectively. A significant difference in surface roughness and colour stability between the test groups was assessed using the paired-t test. The data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0. Results: Colour stability and surface roughness variations between the baseline value and three groups were found to be unaltered by different acidic media. The intergroup comparison of spectrophotometric analysis between the three groups had a standard deviation of 0.422 for citric acid medium, 0.316 for Coffee medium and 0.422 for Tobacco medium with an overall p-value of 0.804. The intergroup comparison of profilometric analysis had a standard deviation of 0.316 for Citric acid medium, 0.00 for Coffee medium and 0.00 for Tobacco medium with an overall p-value of 0.381. The paired-t-test study showed that immersion in different acidic media had little effect on surface roughness of samples with a p-value of 0.343 but it was under clinically acceptable range. Conclusion: According to the present study, high translucency monolithic zirconia had greater colour stability when treated with citric acid, followed by tobacco and then with coffee media, whereas, zirconia in coffee media had greater surface roughness, followed by tobacco, and then with citric acid media. However, both the results were clinically acceptable, indicating a 10 year lifespan when properly glazed.",Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.7860/jcdr/2023/59883.17749', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.7860/jcdr/2023/59883.17749?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.7860/jcdr/2023/59883.17749, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Despite their profound influence on the contemporary art scene, women artists working with textiles such as Elsebeth Rahlff, Gitte Daehlin, Tove Pedersen and Brit Fuglevaag have been largely underrepresented in museum collections and art historical research. In recent years there has been renewed interest in the artistic practice and legacy of female artists working in the 1970s and onwards, with the exhibition Hold Stenhårdt Fast På Greia Di – Norwegian Art and Feminism 1968–89 at Kunsthall Oslo (2013) and Kunsthall Bergen (2014); and the research project Feminist Legacy in Art Museums (FLAME) organized by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) (2020–2025). Elisabeth Haarr – who was part of the feminist avant-garde of the 1970s, and has since been one of the most important artists in Norway – was named this year’s artist at Festival Exhibition, which takes place annually at Bergen Kunsthall. The Festival Exhibition is her largest exhibition to date and features new work alongside a selection of key works from different periods in her career. Elisabeth Haarr emerged as an artist in 1968 and she soon started experimenting with representational images and text in her tapestries.

66c0d4e74e01eaa0a4e78542b4e7366189bed812,Experience of Teaching a Course on Software Engineering Principles Without a Project,"This paper summarizes an experience in designing and delivering a course ""Software Development Essentials"", a second year computer science course designed to teach software engineering skills without a project component. This paper describes the motivation, design, and implementation of the course. This course was offered as a pilot course that enrolled approximately 65 students at the University of Virginia. The need for the course emerged as we found many later project-centric courses assumed students already had knowledge and skills related to build configuration, database usage, design, version control, and incremental development, despite none of them materials being covered in our intro programming sequence. Further, in the project-centric software engineering course (typically a third-year course), students often were expected to start on a project before concepts such as design principles, design patterns, and incremental development were covered. Thus, students were often learning these principles and techniques after they had already been working on a project for weeks, and often too late to implement these into the project naturally. This course is not intended to replace a software engineering course. Rather, this course is intended to prepare students for future project courses, including a software engineering course. In this paper, we describe our experience designing and delivering this course in the Spring semester 2020. We review both student and faculty feedback of the course, and what changes may be made when this course is made available in the future to a large population of students.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2021.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3408877.3432550?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3432550, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

402078b2aba5eefe81eef14578117a4caf728f05,"Do not invade, just support.","BACKGROUND
Since the first attempts for ventilation, there have been significant changes in terms of the size of devices, ventilation techniques, and technology. In time, invasive methods and huge devices were replaced by non-invasive methods and small and portable devices. Increased use of non-invasive methods was followed by enrichment of literature on the topic. This study aimed to determine the evolution of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) literature and predict future trends.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used the Web of Science database for search. To include all papers, we searched multiple keywords, including ""non-invasive ventilation, non-invasive positive pressure, continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP, NIV."" All articles that meet the criteria published in the respiratory system, critical care medicine, anesthesiology, and emergency medicine fields during 1975-2020 were determined.


RESULTS
We made bibliometric analyses of 2847 original articles. However, the limited number of articles in the first years, published by year, exceeded a hundred with the new millennium and continues to increase. We predict that 233 and 334 papers will be published in 2021-2025, respectively. Most active countries were United States of America (576, 20.2 %), France (395, 13.8 %), Italy (293, 10.2 %). The most used keywords in NIV papers are non-invasive ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure and obstructive sleep apnea.


CONCLUSION
NIV technology and new devices are developing day by day. In addition, new areas of use have been defined by doctors. All these bring about new and different studies on NIV. We believe the present study that summarized the history and development of NIV literature will guide the authors who want to study this area (Tab. 4, Fig. 8, Ref. 19).",Bratislava Medical Journal,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'http://www.elis.sk/download_file.php?product_id=7586&session_id=jnkh66ul5v5sjlpqfphm47sl86', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4149/bll_2022_036?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4149/bll_2022_036, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Aalto University Mets\""ahovi Radio Observatory has collected solar intensity maps for over 45 years. Most data coverage is on the 37 GHz frequency band, tracking emissions primarily at the chromosphere and coronal transition region. The data spans four sunspot cycles or two solar magnetic cycles. Aims. We present solar maps, including recently restored data prior to 1989, spanning 1978 to 2020 after correcting for observational and temporal bias. Methods. The solar maps consist of radio intensity sampled along scanlines of the antenna sweep. We fit a circular disk to the set of intensity samples, neglecting any exceptional features in the fitting process to improve accuracy. Applying a simple astronomical model of Sun and Earth, we assign each radio specimen its heliographic coordinates at the time of observation. We bin the sample data by time and heliographic latitude to construct a diagram analoguous to the classic butterfly diagram of sunspot activity. Results. Radio butterfly diagram at 37 GHz, spanning solar cycles 21 to 24 and extending near to the poles. Conclusions. We have developed a method for compensating for seasonal and atmospheric bias in the radio data, as well as correcting for the effects of limb brightening and beamwidth convolution to isolate physical features. Our observations are consistent with observations in nearby bandwidths and indicate the possibility of polar cyclic behaviour with a period exceeding the solar 11 year cycle. Key words.

d6c0328b3011e43f507ec534cb16dc72bc12b486,Digital exclusion predicts worse mental health among adolescents during COVID-19,"Background: Social isolation is strongly associated with poor mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social restrictions disrupted young people's social interactions and resulted in several periods during which school closures necessitated online learning. We hypothesise that digitally excluded young people would demonstrate greater deterioration in their mental health than their digitally connected peers during this time. Methods: We analysed representative mental health data from a sample of UK 10-15-year-olds (N = 1387); Understanding Society collected the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in 2017-19 and thrice during the pandemic (July 2020, November 2020 and March 2021). We employed cross-sectional methods and longitudinal latent growth curve modelling to describe trajectories of adolescent mental health for participants with and without access to a computer or a good internet connection for schoolwork. Outcomes: Adolescent mental health had a quadratic trajectory during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest mean Total Difficulties score around December 2020. The worsening and recovery of mental health during the pandemic was greatly pronounced among those without access to a computer, although we did not find evidence for a similar effect among those without a good internet connection. Interpretation: Digital exclusion, as indicated by lack of access to a computer, is a tractable risk factor that likely compounds other adversities facing children and young people during periods of social isolation.

641e651356fe12cee089997e4ea9ff2628f53a07,Employability: Smart learning in extracurricular activities for developing college graduates' competencies,"Nowadays, employers expect college graduates (or simply “graduates”) to be for ready in taking up challenges when they enter into their careers. Most competencies that employers are looking for cannot be learned but can be developed by participating in extracurricular activities. However, planning on participation in extracurricular activities is difficult, given the lack of measurement standards together with their unstructured and non-systematic nature. To provide a smarter way for activity organisers, advisers and students to plan for extracurricular activities, our university has launched the central repository on student development activities system and codified the information about participation in extracurricular activities in a quantified and systematic way. This paper has collected data from three consecutive years from the system, the employers' feedback data and the academic performance data of placement students in the Department of Computer Science. Participation level, with logarithm transformation, had a positive and significant relationship with academic performance. Moreover, the competency developed by most students had a positive relationship with job performance in the placement year of 2019/2020.

9c2f39ff03dfe87d0a5c52a666afa7ea1848700d,'Science to action' of the sustainable low carbon city-region: lessons learnt from Iskandar Malaysia,"This paper outlines the lessons learnt through the multidisciplinary 'Science-to-Action' approach to formulating, mainstreaming and implementing the Low Carbon Society Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia 2025 (LCSBP-IM2025). Iskandar Malaysia (IM) is a rapidly developing urban region in southern Peninsular Malaysia that was institutionalised in 2006 with a view to spurring Malaysia's economic growth up to 2025. In pursuing rapid economic growth to become a developed, high-income nation by 2020, Malaysia is conscious of its global responsibility in environmental protection and global climate change mitigation, hence the country's commitment to reducing its carbon emission intensity of GDP by up to 40% by 2020 based on the 2005 level. Being a premier economic region in Malaysia, IM seeks to develop a low carbon society (LCS) and lead the way to cutting its carbon emission intensity by up to 58 % by 2025 based on the 2005 level through the implementation of the LCSBP-IM2025. The LCSBP-IM2025 is the outcome of an internationally funded joint research under the SATREPS programme that brings together Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Kyoto University, Japan's National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Okayama University and the Iskandar Regional Development Authority (IRDA), in a unique 'academia-policymaker' partnership, towards crafting an LCS pathway to guide and sustainably manage the projected rapid development in IM up to 2025. To that end, a multidisciplinary research team that comprises the above research institutions and IRDA, led by UTM, has been set up. A methodology has been developed to formulate IM's future LCS scenarios, propose LCS actions to achieve the LCS scenarios, quantify the GHG emission reduction potential of the proposed LCS actions and continuously engage local stakeholders in a series of focus group discussions (FGDs). The project has been a great success from its official commencement in July 2011, which saw the LCSBP-IM2025 being launched at UNFCCC's COP 18 in Doha in November 2012 and officially endorsed by the Malaysian Prime Minister in December the same year. In November 2013, the Iskandar Malaysia Actions for a Low Carbon Future was launched, outlining ten priority projects selected from the LCSBP-IM2025's 281 programmes for implementation in IM in 2013-2015; the projects are now at various stages of implementation, yielding real impacts on IM's progression towards its LCS goal. The project offers valuable lessons especially in advancing scientific research on LCS into policymaking and, importantly, into real actions (hence, Science to Action). These include the importance of having strong highest-level government support, aligning LCS actions to higher-level development priorities, taking policymakers on-board the research team, continuously actively engaging local communities and stakeholders through FGDs and overcoming science-policy and disciplinary gaps that emerged.What is clearly evidenced by the LCSBP-IM2025's success is that developing countries, with good synergy between highly committed local research institutions and policymakers, subject to adequate international funding and technological assistance from developed nations, are capable of crafting and putting in place implementable LCS policies that eventually contribute to mitigating global climate change through real cuts in GHG emissions while still achieving a desired level of economic growth.",,2015.0,5,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-981-287-826-7_7.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/978-981-287-826-7_7?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-287-826-7_7, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This award provided the opportunity to create a program where students and faculty are immersed in a culture of doing engineering with practicing engineers that in turn fosters an identity of being an engineer. Of the many strategies implemented to support this goal, one significant curricular change was the creation of a new multi-year design course sequence. This set of three courses, the integrated design project (IDP) sequence, creates an annual curricular-driven opportunity for students to interact with each other and professional engineers in the context of an open-ended design project. These three courses are offered to all departmental first-, second-, and third-year students simultaneously during the spring quarter each year. Each course consists of design-focused classroom instruction tailored to that class year, and a term design project that is completed by teams of students drawn from all three class years. This structure provides students with regular design education, while also creating a curricular space for students across the department to interact with and learn from one of another in a meaningful way. This structure not only prepares students for their senior design experience, but also builds a sense of community and belonging in the department. Furthermore, to support the “engineering with engineers” vision, volunteer engineers from industry participate as consultants in the design project activities, giving students the opportunity to learn from professionals regularly throughout their entire four years in the program. This course sequence was offered for the first time in 2020, and while the global pandemic impacted the experience, the initial offering was by all accounts a success. This paper provides an overview of the motivation for the three IDP courses, their format, objectives, and specific implementation details, and a discussion of some of the lessons learned. These particulars provide other engineering departments with a roadmap for how to implement this type of a curricular experience in their own programs.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2021.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637480?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637480, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

45eddd9497f8af3aadce587d68e14ab14b8bac49,Editorial: In Memory of Mark Robbins,"In this special issue, we remember Mark Robbins, who passed away, unexpectedly, on August 14, 2020. The many submissions by world-renowned scientists only provide a glimpse of the appreciation that he received for the unique way in which he used computer simulations to deepen our understanding of mechanical and thermal properties of condensed matter systems. He was a true giant in the field, while being as humble, warmhearted, and empathetic as a physicist can possibly be. Mark received his BA and MA degrees from Harvard University. After 1 year as a Churchill Fellow at Cambridge University, he moved on to the University of California, Berkeley, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1983. Following an interlude as a postdoctoral fellow at Exxon’s Corporate Research Science Laboratory in New Jersey, he accepted an offer from Johns Hopkins University in 1986, where he spent his entire career as a professor in the Department of Physics & Astronomy. He became a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2000 and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2017. He was awarded Simons Fellowships in Theoretical Physics in 2012 and 2019. Mark served our community as organizer of more than a dozen conferences, symposia, and workshops including the KITP workshop, From the Atomic to the Tectonic: Friction, Fracture and Earthquake Physics in 2005, and the Gordon Research Conference on Tribology in 2010. Mark’s contributions to condensed-matter physics in general and to tribology in particular were as numerous as they were multi-faceted. Here, I describe some of them from a personal perspective, although messages that I received from former colleagues, collaborators, and his many friends and alumni confirmed and corroborated my deep admiration of him as both a scientist and a person. When I first learned about Mark Robbins in 1997, I was a Postdoc in the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University and was concerned with what I thought was complicated mathematics that allowed us to push the borders of how water can be modeled realistically. My former Ph.D. supervisor, Kurt Binder, whom I could trust blindly, had recommended me to join Mark’s group. Thus, I was in a state of shock when I realized that most of the things that Mark did boiled down to the use of something as archaic as bead-spring models, Lennard–Jones potentials, and the Verlet algorithm. However, I quickly learned why Mark was already famous at that time. Mark had been invited to give a colloquium at Rockefeller University and he seized the opportunity to get to know me as his prospective postdoc. We had a pleasant chat in a small café on Broadway, which, in retrospect may have been the real interview, since Mark fell asleep during my official interview. He blamed this on his newly born son Thomas, though I feared it was my fault. In retrospect, I suspect that he pushed himself more than was good for him. The introduction of Mark at Rockefeller started as usual with the mentioning of his academic career and his official recognitions. But then came the sentence that still rings in my ears and best describes Mark’s work: Although Mark Robbins is a computational physicist, he does not produce numbers but insight. There can be scarcely a greater compliment * Martin H.

9a4a34af6c5586537e8a4fbedeb2110aadc4c047,EXAMINATION OF PARENTS' FAMILY NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ATTITUDES IN TERMS OF VARIOUS DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES (ELAZIĞ EXAMPLE),"Individuals who do not have balanced nutrition during childhood encounter the problem of obesity. The most important environmental risk factors in the emergence of obesity are: changing dietary habits, increased screen time spent with technological devices such as computers, tablets, phones, and televisions, adopting a sedentary lifestyle as a result, and a decrease in physical activity. In addition, factors such as increased academic stress on children, socio-economic level, and residing in major cities are also risk factors. In line with this information, the purpose of our research is to examine the relationship between parents' family nutrition and physical activity attitudes and the eating behaviors of high school students. First, the universe was determined in our study, followed by the use of the general survey model from quantitative research methods. Parents of 375 high school students studying in the 2022-2023 academic year participated in the research. The relationships between the variables in our research were analyzed statistically. The ""Family Nutrition and Physical Activity Screening Scale"" (Özdemir, 2020) was used to collect data. Our application form consists of two sections. The first section contains the demographic information form containing the data to be collected from the participants. The second section contains the scale form to be used in the research. The scale consists of five sub-dimensions: physical activity, parental behaviors, unhealthy eating habits, healthy food intake, and sedentary behaviors, restriction/reward sub-dimensions. SPSS 21 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) was used in the study. First, the analysis of descriptive statistical data of the participant group was performed. Then, the internal consistency coefficient was calculated. After that, t-tests and ANOVA tests were conducted to analyze the differentiation of scale results. Under the Post-Hoc heading, the Tukey test was performed for scale scores showing homogeneous distribution, and the direction of differentiation was determined. In the research, when the average values of the groups were examined, it was observed that the family nutrition and physical activity attitudes of males were higher than those of females. There was no significant differentiation for variables such as age, class, monthly income status, school type, success status, and parental education status. When the variable data on breakfast habits were examined, it was found that the participants who answered ""I have breakfast at home"" significantly differed from those who answered ""I have breakfast at school"" and ""I do not have breakfast.""",SOCIAL SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31567/ssd.1060?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31567/ssd.1060, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e9d898c332adce9487ef78b94632c65445aaf198,EFL STUDENTS’ RESPONSES ON ONLINE LEARNING PROCESS DURING COVID-19 SITUATION IN INDONESIA,"Indonesian EFL students faced online teaching and learning in such a rapid process. Therefore, this research was carried out to search for EFL students in Indonesia about their responses on teaching and learning online. This research applied the action research method with the paradigm of quantitative descriptive approach. Data for this research was collected via an online questionnaire, distributed to one class size sample consisting of 32 students in the even semester of the 2019/2020 academic year at one of the private colleges in the West Sumatra province of Indonesia. The data were analysed by descriptive statistics, especially the percentage of each item available in the questionnaire. Findings of this research show that the respondents, or the students, had their evaluation toward the online teaching and learning. The significance of this research is that their responses briefly invite us as scholars, teachers, and lecturers, or scholar-practitioners, to think about the feasibility condition of online teaching and learning, that it should be done contextually and prepared carefully. The Covid-19 pandemic situation has forced students to face double challenges in education: learning the materials in such a digitalized situation and handling external issues emerging while learning online.

823538d337683605d81814ffbcb3c579f4543b38,Effectiveness of the WebQuest Strategy-Based Educational Platform and Learning Environment in Acquiring Biological Concepts and Systemic Thinking in the Biology Course among Pre-Service Teachers,"This study aims at uncovering the effectiveness of the WebQuest strategy-based learning environment in the teaching of biological concepts and imparting of systemic thinking. The participants of the study, 64 pre-service teachers (students) for the 2020–2021 academic year, were divided randomly into experimental and control groups. WhatsApp groups were used to communicate with the students. To achieve the study’s objectives, a teacher’s manual for biological concepts was prepared following the WebQuest Model; the WebQuests were created using the Zunal computer programmes. Both biological concepts and systemic thinking assessments were prepared and the study tools were tested for accuracy and reliability. To answer the research questions, data were analysed using ANCOVA and MANCOVA. There were significant differences between the average performances of the two study groups on the scale of the acquisition of biological concepts in favour of the experimental group. Additionally, there were significant differences between the average performances of the groups on a scale of systemic thinking in favour of the experimental group. The results encouraged the educational supervisors to hold training courses and workshops for science teachers, training them in the use of the WebQuest strategy in science teaching and urging its implementation in teaching – through individual instruction and publications. The Ministry of Education must play a role in designing and writing the science curricula and provide a guide for the teachers explaining the ways to employ the WebQuest strategy in the process of teaching science.","International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research",2021.0,3,"{'url': 'http://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter/article/download/3511/pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.26803/IJLTER.20.4.4?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.26803/IJLTER.20.4.4, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f5c6407bbc2d2682668ff8c0853b88e677e8695f,Editorial,"Dear Readers,
 It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to our first regular issue in 2021 covering 3 very relevant and novel articles in various computer science topics.
 There are also many news and changes with the beginning of the new year that I am excited to report on and share. To start with, we are very happy to welcome two new consortium members and editors-in-chief: California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo represented by Prof. Christian Eckhardt from the Department of Computer Science & Software Engineering and the Institute for IDEAS at American University in Washington DC represented by Prof. Krzysztof Pietroszek. On the management side of J.UCS, Dana Kaiser has retired at the end of last year, and on behalf of the journal I want to gratefully thank Dana for her devoted and great work since the foundation of this journal. I also want to give Johanna Zeisberg a warm welcome who will take over the role as Publishing Manager and collaborate and support the whole J.UCS community. On the technical side, our journal has moved to another submission and publishing platform. Since the foundation of J.UCS more than 25 years ago, the journal has offered readers, authors and editors various novel features over the course of the years. In this perspective but also in terms of the visionary view of founding a freely accessibly online journal, I want to express our deep gratitude for the contributions of Prof. Hermann Maurer to the success of J.UCS for almost 20 years. Since beginning of 2021, J.UCS is hosted by Pensoft Publishers Ltd. on the ARPHA Publishing Platform. This allows us not only to offer state-of-the-art publishing features but also to make use of integrated long-time archiving systems and various indexing services. In this context I also want to thank Internet Studio Isser and Photographer Christian Trummer for the kind support in the development of the design update and the J.UCS images.
 In this first issue of the year, I also want to look back on the journal’s achievements in 2020. We are proud to report a total of 11 issues with 74 articles on novel aspects of various topics in computer science; to be more specific, 51 articles have been published in 7 special issues and 23 articles in 4 regular issues. Since last year, J.UCS publishes under the open access Creative Commons License CC BY-ND 4.0 and therefore provides even more value und openness to a broader community. In 2020, we counted more than 87 thousand unique visits and almost 65 thousand paper downloads. This success is only possible due to the great support of the involved institutions, reviewers and authors, and I want to gratefully thank them all for their valuable support and work. Over the years we have not only offered readers open access to our high-quality journal, but we also do not charge our authors publication fees. This adventurous approach together with a rigorous review process and a broad support by the community resulted in a valuable contribution in the field of computer science, which is reflected in the high number of unique visitors and article downloads. In this context I gratefully thank all consortium members for their financial support of J.UCS.
 I am looking forward to continuing the cooperation with our editors, the editorial team and the technical support to maintain the success of J.UCS. I would be very grateful for suggestions and feedback on how we can even improve and develop J.UCS in the future.
 In this regular issue, I am very pleased to introduce 3 accepted papers from 5 different countries.
 On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the J.UCS journal, Nelson Baloian, José A. Pino, Gustavo Zurita, Valeria Lobos-Ossandón, and Hermann Maurer analyze and discuss a bibliometric overview of the first 25 years of the journal in their collaboration between Austria and Chile. In a collaborative research between China and Spain, Xin Liu, Xiaoying Song, Wei Gao, Li Zou, and Alvaro Labella Romero report on their decision making approach based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic-valued credibility reasoning. And finally, Christian Moreira Matos, Vitor Kehl Matter, Marcio Garcia Martins, Joao Elison Da Rosa Tavares, Alexandre Sturmer Wolf, Paulo Cesar Buttenbender, and Jorge Luis Victoria Barbosa from Brazil discuss a collaborative model to assist people with disabilities and the elderly people in smart assistive cities.

fc38e233f8391d9d960760619c344da6d6969c04,Pivoting in a Pandemic: Transitioning from In-person to Virtual K-8 Computing Professional Development,"This poster reports on year one of a three-year NSF-funded Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP) to develop a K-8 pipeline for computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky : Pikeville Independent School District and Floyd County Schools. Economically devastated by the departure of the coal industry, these communities are committed to developing high-quality computing curricula for all students, beginning in their earliest years. The poster has two components. First, through a mixture of qualitative measures, the poster reports on the genesis and development of the RPP. It focuses on the RPP's origin in leveraging the districts' existing relationship with Pennsylvania's South Fayette School District, which has developed one of the nation's leading programs for teacher professional development (PD) in K-12 computing. The second component of the poster focuses on the development of a series of summer workshops for Kentucky Appalachia K-8 instructors to learn the basics of CS and CT and how to integrate these skills and concepts into existing K-8 coursework. Of course, the RPP faced new challenges with COVID-19 most notably, the need to offer these summer workshops remotely, and adjusting the objectives and research questions accordingly. Through focus groups with the PD instructional team and survey responses from the KY teacher workshop participants, the poster will report on the pedagogical implications of offering teacher PD exclusively online and what the ramifications have been for Pikeville and Floyd County children with the return to school in the Fall of 2020.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3408877.3439665?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3439665, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

14ea84ad2d2c179139a2fae4b10d6dc9406882f1,Development of massive open online course (MOOC) based on addie model for catering courses,"Nowadays, innovation for teaching aids is an important requirement to ensure the teaching and learning process can run smoothly. Coinciding with the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2013-2025 (Ministry of Education) through the ninth surge of Global Online Learning, the development of the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) was built. The ADDIE model has been adapted for this development. The study aims to develop an appropriate interactive learning for Food and Beverage Presentation subjects based on the Vocational College (VC) syllabus. In research development, researchers use Richey and Klein research recommendations, using Alpha and Beta tests in the evaluation phase of the study. The population of the study involved 155 Catering students at Muar Vocational College and the sample of the study were 60 of third and fourth-year Diploma students. The sampling method used is the purposive sampling and the instrument used in the form of the questionnaire. Data collected were collected and analyzed descriptively using Statistical Packages for Social Science (SPSS) version 23.0. Based on the analysis, the reliability value of the instrument is 0.997 and shows that the reliability of the instrument is at a high level. The findings show that the use of MOOC can increase computer literacy (3.75), interest (3.78) and student learning styles (3.75) and make the learning process more interesting. In addition, the findings show that the use of the MOOC application can help students in improving the performance and achievement of students in learning and thus can be an alternative to diversifying the teaching and learning process in VC.",Jurnal Pendidikan Vokasi,2018.0,28,"{'url': 'https://journal.uny.ac.id/index.php/jpv/article/download/19828/10961', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21831/JPV.V8I2.19828?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21831/JPV.V8I2.19828, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b0005b60281628f5b3ca4f2aa3401611ff04a402,A Systematic Review and Trend Analysis of Personal Learning Environments Research,"The concept of personal learning environments (PLEs) is relatively new and is continuously developing. Over the past decade, there has been a significant upsurge in the number of PLEs-related research. Nevertheless, there is a lack of recent systematic reviews and trend analysis covering many PLEs studies; to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, the current systematic review is significant and indispensable in reviewing journal articles that discussed PLEs between 2000 and 2020. We searched Web of Science, Scopus, Sciences Direct, JSTOR, Springer, Google Scholar, and IEEE Xplore for studies published in English without limit in location or time to retrieve accurate results. Trend graphics for the extracted themes were also analyzed using descriptive statistics in Excel. According to the defined inclusion criteria, one hundred forty-eight articles were selected for the analysis. This study reveals that literature on PLEs has progressed from 2000 to 2020; the majority of PLEs-related articles were published between 2011 and 2020, with the year 2013 having the highest number of published articles (17 articles), followed by 16 papers published in both years 2014 and 2017. We found that the published PLEs research originated from 46 countries; 26 (17.6%) were from Spain. The majority of the authors had education, computer science, information technology and engineering backgrounds. This review also showed that numerous platforms had been used in PLEs research, with Web 2.0 the most commonly used platform.

5d8281eeff0058dcaebea1e7cf20fa0675f94d8d,LAunchPad: The Design and Evaluation of a STEM Recruitment Program for Women,"This paper presents the design and evaluation of a university-sponsored summer STEM recruitment program for young women between their junior and senior year in high school. The College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology (ECST) currently has a female enrollment of only 15%, which is below the national average of 20%. The College has set a goal of increasing the percentage of women to 25% by 2025. The recruitment program described in this paper is one of the strategies the ECST will use to reach its goal. The objectives of the recruitment program, LAunchPad, were to increase the students’ interest in engineering and computer science, and to achieve a 50% participant matriculation rate into the College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology. LAunchPad established a gender-inclusive learning environment, with scaffolded instruction and hands-on activities to reinforce the learning. The students were also introduced to two groups of female role models; the first group was early-career alumni that held technical positions with local companies, and the second group was mid- to senior-level engineers, computer scientists, and executives. A post-event survey revealed that the students’ interest in pursuing an engineering or computer science career increased by 29%; seventy percent applied for admission to the University for the following Fall. Results suggest that contributing factors to the students’ increased interest are an increased understanding of engineering and computer science, increased confidence, access to diverse role models, and the ability to establish peer networks.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2018.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659097?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659097, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9046f24ba4e56a11c12ceffbbf4db28348aa72cf,"Applying Talent Quality-Management System (TTQS) to Enhance Information Literacy, Learning Motivation, and Computational Thinking Competency of Nursing Undergraduates","In Taiwan, the Ministry of Education started promoting computational thinking (CT) and design skills in the programming curriculum in 2018 at all universities. CT, which has been widely discussed in the field of education, is the ability to solve problems that use computer science concepts. For students in non-information technology fields, such as nursing students, a curriculum that integrates nursing education and information literacy can bolster evidence-based practice, enhance professional development, and encourage lifelong learning. However, the programming courses were difficult for non-information learners to apprehend, given their lack of knowledge in programming, and had a low attrition rate. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a sustainable management system in the learning process. It is also important to support the interest and confidence of the nursing learner in the programming curriculum. In this study, a programming course for nursing students was completed. A talent quality-management system (TTQS) for this programming course was built and implemented. A technology acceptance model and learning attitude questionnaires were administered to investigate learners’ learning motivation and information literacy. Two nursing classes with 74 freshmen participated in the curriculum in the second semester of the 2020 academic year. The results showed that TTQS, which supports teachers in adjusting pedagogy in a timely manner, can enhance learners’ motivation and performance. In this programming course, nursing students can learn CT and information concepts and improve their learning motivation through the design of learner-centred and collaborative learning.",Sustainability,2021.0,6,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/12/6528/pdf?version=1624344060', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/SU13126528?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13126528, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The analysis method used is descriptive qualitative. The study took place at Vocational High School 2 Cikarang Barat from July 2020 to December 2020. The school principal, deputy headmaster in charge of facilities and infrastructure, maintenance support staff, and students of Vocational High School 2 Cikarang Barat served as research informants. Interviews, observation, and reporting studies are all used to collect data. After that, the data is analyzed by reducing it, presenting it, and drawing conclusions. The triangulation of sources, techniques, and hypotheses is a validity technique. The study's findings indicate that: (1) Vocational High School 2 Cikarang Barat maintenance preparation starts with a work meeting, and then maintenance is divided into two categories: normal and routine maintenance. A one-year budget is generated after deciding maintenance tasks based on their categories. Following that, representatives from the facilities and infrastructure sector specifically select the structure of facility and infrastructure maintenance, as well as their respective job desks in each division, which are known to the school principal. The final move is to socialize students at school. (2) School maintenance processes and techniques begin with frequent and routine maintenance. Routine maintenance includes the upkeep of classrooms, teacher's offices, and special rooms such as libraries, computer laboratories, and science labs. The school also performs routine maintenance on air conditioners, printers, and photocopiers, as well as computer program upgrades. (3) Obstacles faced by schools in preparing facility and infrastructure repairs, including, among other problems, things that arise unexpectedly and need urgent repair at the facility. The lack of knowledge of users of school facilities and infrastructure, partners with outsiders who are often less sensitive, and cultural differences among individuals in the use of facilities and infrastructure are among the process and technological obstacles encountered.",Akademika,2021.0,10,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.34005/akademika.v10i01.1348', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.34005/AKADEMIKA.V10I01.1348?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.34005/AKADEMIKA.V10I01.1348, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

66a6ea7ba2968e42319f76fe6da80c532134eaf3,The experience of teaching introductory programming skills to bioscientists in Brazil,"Computational biology has gained traction as an independent scientific discipline over the last years in South America. However, there is still a growing need for bioscientists, from different backgrounds, with different levels, to acquire programming skills, which could reduce the time from data to insights and bridge communication between life scientists and computer scientists. Python is a programming language extensively used in bioinformatics and data science, which is particularly suitable for beginners. Here, we describe the conception, organization, and implementation of the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data. This workshop has been organized by graduate and undergraduate students and supported, mostly in administrative matters, by experienced faculty members since 2017. The workshop was conceived for teaching bioscientists, mainly students in Brazil, on how to program in a biological context. The goal of this article was to share our experience with the 2020 edition of the workshop in its virtual format due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to compare and contrast this year’s experience with the previous in-person editions. We described a hands-on and live coding workshop model for teaching introductory Python programming. We also highlighted the adaptations made from in-person to online format in 2020, the participants’ assessment of learning progression, and general workshop management. Lastly, we provided a summary and reflections from our personal experiences from the workshops of the last 4 years. Our takeaways included the benefits of the learning from learners’ feedback (LLF) that allowed us to improve the workshop in real time, in the short, and likely in the long term. We concluded that the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data is a highly effective workshop model for teaching a programming language that allows bioscientists to go beyond an initial exploration of programming skills for data analysis in the medium to long term.",PLoS Comput.

The article is devoted to the study of the relationship of students’ creativity and their emotional well-being during the period of forced distance learning. It was found that students with a higher creative potential easier coped with periods of social restrictions, felt less anxiety, were better satisfied with the distance learning process, while experiencing a lack of face-to-face communication with the instructor.Aim. The aim of the current research was to identify the relationship between students’ creativity and their emotional well-being during the period of forced self-isolation in 2020–2021.Methodology and research methods. The research was carried out within the framework of health care pedagogy. The methodological basis of the study included pedagogical principles of promotion, maintenance and restoration of emotional health; development of knowledge, skills and abilities to maintain emotional health especially during online studies. Creativity was measured with the Torrance test of creative thinking; emotional state – with a well-being questionnaire created by the authors on the Google Forms platform. The study population was represented by 387 1–4-year bachelors studying the humanities (Philology, Linguistics, History, Sociology and Pedagogy) and technical sciences (Petroleum Engineering, Computer Science) at the Tyumen Industrial University, Tyumen State University and South Ural State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University.Results. Statistical analysis confirmed the hypothesis about the relationship of students’ creativity and their emotional well-being during the quarantine period. Students with higher scores on the Originality scale experienced less anxiety and stress during the quarantine period (r = –0.36*). A negative relationship was found between the variables “Originality” and “Comfort in using PPE” (r = –0.38*), “Development” and “Satisfaction with communication with the instructor” (r = –0.41**), “Fluency” and “Comfort of using PPE” (r = –0.49**). The ways of stress relief used by students during the period of self-isolation were identified and described. It was found that more than half of the students intuitively chose creative activities (61.3%) to improve their well-being.Scientific novelty. The scientific novelty lies in an attempt to present students’ creativity as a resource that requires special activation during the period of forced self-isolation within the general framework of health care pedagogy.Practical significance. Eleven forms and methods of creative interaction with students are suggested. Research findings aim at forming health preserving skills in students, especially during distance learning, by stimulating their creative resources.",The Education and science journal,2022.0,3,"{'url': 'https://www.edscience.ru/jour/article/download/2893/1110', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17853/1994-5639-2022-8-138-169?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17853/1994-5639-2022-8-138-169, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Bibliometric data were retrieved from Scopus databases. The findings suggest a rising trend in terms of citations and publications showing increased interest in the VR domain have been seen during the last few decades. The year in which the most citations of this type occurred was 2009, in which 1913 citations were recorded, whereas 2019 was the most productive year, as 127 documents on this subject were published in that year. The data analysis revealed that all the top ten researchers belong to Australia. Further, the top three researchers (Gregory S., Lee, M.J.W., and Wood, D.), countries (United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia), organizations (Charles Sturt University, Queensland University of Technology, and University of New England, Australia), journals (Computers and Education, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning, and Journal of Surgical Education) and collaborations (Australia and New Zealand, United States and the United Kingdom, and Australia and the United Kingdom) belong to developed countries. Virtual reality, virtual worlds, augmented reality, e-learning, and simulations are the top keywords used in the VR domain. The thematic evolution of the keyword shows the importance of “Virtual Reality” as a keyword throughout the 27 years of its existence (1994–2020).

13d9fcb0bd8c7738631610ae9dc37655a9410075,Educated Citizenry or Workforce Pipeline Development? Questions for the Future of Undergraduate Public Health in the United States.,"Priortothe COVID-19 pandemic (academic year 2019-2020), master's degrees in public health saw the first sustained year-to-year drop in applications since data have been recorded, whereas conferrals of UGPHDs continued to grow, although the pace of acceleration slowed substantially.5 However, COVID-19-related interest in public health and a temperamental economy yielded an all-time high pool of graduate public health applicants beginning in March 2020, providing a reprieve from the expected stagnation of graduate applications.3,5-7 Although demographic changes and economic pressures are still expected to reduce the number of high school graduates, undergraduates, and thus master's degree students in the medium term,7 the immediate future of academic public health in the aftermath of the pandemic faces much uncertainty.8,9 Conferrals of UGPHDs now eclipse those for master's degrees, but only a small percentage of the governmental public health workforce-even among new entrants-has a bachelor's or master's degree in public health.10 Data from the Associations of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH) show that a relatively small percentage of those with either undergraduate or graduate degrees in public health end up in governmental public health practice.11 ASPPH data on undergraduates show that first jobs out of school were in for-profit organizations (38%), health care (27%), academic institutions (10%), government (10%), and all others (15%). Reports from the Institute of Medicine and ASPPH have long laid out a vision wherein master's-trained students represent the future leadership of the governmental public health workforce.2,4 However, data indicate that most public health graduates at any degree level do not go into governmental public health, and particularly at the undergraduate level. [...]the identity of the undergraduate degree becomes paramount, especially as vision documents for the field and accreditation requirements for the degree are aimed at preparing students for the governmental public health workforce. A final point in the consideration of value is that motivations matter to job satisfaction, perhaps as much as compensation.6 As such, assessments of value to any degree should consider both the monetary and nonmonetary benefits ofthe degree and potential employment outcomes. 6.What is a reasonable upper bound on the expected number of undergraduate degrees in public health each year? Among profession-focused degrees, in 2020, ratios for bachelor's versus master's degrees were 5 to 1 for nursing, 2.8 to 1 for computer science, and 1.4 to 1 for business degrees;however, for humanities-based degrees a distinctly different picture emerges, with ratios of 22 to 1 for sociology and 23 to 1 for political science degrees.7 Although it seems functionally impossible to have 20 UGPHDs awarded for every one master's degree in public health, it may be plausible to see a ratio of 2 to 1 or even 3 to 1, contingent on employment outcomes and loan repayment options.3,12 CONCLUSIONS Undergraduate public health education is clearly here to stay, and needs to be a core part of academic public health's plans for the future.",American Journal of Public Health,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8961847', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2105/AJPH.2022.306742?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2022.306742, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b4da50a91d4e4d9c50d8b00dc7684616ae9d1e32,PyDash - A Framework Based Educational Tool for Adaptive Streaming Video Algorithms Study,"Full Paper in the Innovative Practice track - The pandemics caused by the spreading of the COVID 19 virus cornered the educational system worldwide, changing the classroom into remote class activities. This change in our social behavior has directly impacted the volume and shape of the Internet traffic data. A recent study shows 15% to 30% increases in Internet traffic caused, among other reasons, by educational video streaming traffic during few weeks in the 2020 lockdown period in Europe. To give some perspective, network providers usually work with a 30% data traffic increase per year. In 2021, it is expected that almost 82% of all Internet traffic will be video, according to CISCO annual forecast report. This scenario has a tremendous impact on the Internet bandwidth capacity, demanding optimized video streaming solutions, such as adaptive bitrate algorithms (ABR). On the other hand, considering the educational challenges in computer network courses, the core activities must be executed using specialized infrastructure to develop students' capabilities with networking equipment. As these types of equipment are costly to be obtained and forwarded to in-home students or simply e-students, a remote platform capable of reproducing an environment for networking applications is required. This is the scenario where PyDash was built. PyDash is a framework for the development of adaptive streaming video algorithms. It is a learning tool designed to abstract the networking communication details, allowing e-students to focus exclusively on developing and evaluating ABR protocols. This paper presents our practical experience developing and using PyDash as an educational tool for teaching ABR protocols at Computing Networking courses at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Brasilia, Brazil. Last semester, over 120 students, divided into four different undergraduate courses, had their first contact with PyDash. Even though this was their first contact with ABR concepts and the pyDash tool, they were able to perform the design, implementation, validation, and analysis of some state-of-the-art algorithms used by Netflix and Youtube.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637335?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637335, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

39f72ef30068fe3656fc969fbc833c9bfa67d125,ESA Terrae Novae Exploration Strategy 2040,"<p>ESA&#8217;s Exploration Programme, recently renamed &#8220;Terrae Novae&#8221;, encompasses all ESA&#8217;s human and robotic activities related to the exploration and utilisation of Earth Orbit, Moon and Mars. &#160;Its vision is to expand Europe&#8217;s human presence into the solar system using robotic missions as precursors, with the horizon goal of human Mars exploration; and to do this for science, economic benefits, to promote global cooperation and for inspiration<sup>[1]</sup>. &#160;In autumn 2020, ESA initiated a two-year long project to define the Terrae Novae long-term strategy, looking to 2030 and beyond. This abstract provides an introduction to the objectives of the project and summarises the progress and results to date.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is the ultimate goal of the strategy work to provide a lighthouse, to enable a steady orientation and long-term navigation of Europe&#8217;s decision makers on their voyage beyond the current horizons. The strategy work does not revisit the fundamental goals of ESA&#8217;s exploration programme as stated above;&#160; instead, it is preparing the next decisions in implementation that will have to be taken by ESA Member States at the at the ESA Council meeting at ministerial level in 2022 (CM22). Decisions will be required to maintain long term European capabilities (e.g. in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)) and to prepare the next steps (e.g. for lunar surface exploration and preparations to enable humans to Mars). ESA is already anticipating a significant increase in it's request for Exploration Programme funding at CM22.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Agenda 2025 of the new ESA Director General addresses challenges and objectives for ESA in the next four years, with an outlook to 2035<sup>[2]</sup>. Being ambitious is the keyword in this Agenda, in order to position a transformed ESA in an ever more world-wide competitive arena, by &#8220;<em>making space for Europe&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>In a fast evolving international context, the challenging task of the strategy project is to position Europe to realise its exploration ambition in two dimensions.</p>
<p>The presentation will include a status on the strategy development work including the initial results that show options for an integrated exploration roadmap for Europe to 2040. Stakeholder consultation (Member States, Industry, Science Community etc) will continue throughout 2021 into 2022 with refinements of the strategy expected until finalisation and approval by ESA Member States around mid 2022.</p>

0b11c38a6d938916c840e8e5576f206770fd0588,Enhancing RDM in Galaxy by integrating RO-Crate,"We introduce how the Galaxy research environment (Jalili et al. 2020) integrates with RO-Crate as an implementation of Findable Accessible Interoperable Reproducible Digital Objects (FAIR Digital Objects / FDO) (Wilkinson et al. 2016, Schultes and Wittenburg 2018) and how using RO-Crate as an exchange mechanism of workflows and their execution history helps integrate Galaxy with the wider ecosystem of ELIXIR (Harrow et al. 2021) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC-Life) to enable FAIR and reproducible data analysis.
 RO-Crate (Soiland-Reyes et al. 2022) is a generic packaging format containing datasets and their description using standards for FAIR Linked Data. The format is based on schema.org (Guha et al. 2016) annotations in JSON-LD, which allows for rich metadata representation. The RO-Crate effort aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research environments.
 The RO-Crate community brings together practitioners from very different backgrounds, and with different motivations and use cases. Among the core target users are:
 
 
 
 researchers engaged with computation and data-intensive, workflow-driven analysis;
 
 
 digital repository managers and infrastructure providers;
 
 
 individual researchers looking for a straightforward tool or how-to guide to “FAIRify” their data;
 
 
 data stewards supporting research projects in creating and curating datasets.
 
 
 
 researchers engaged with computation and data-intensive, workflow-driven analysis;
 digital repository managers and infrastructure providers;
 individual researchers looking for a straightforward tool or how-to guide to “FAIRify” their data;
 data stewards supporting research projects in creating and curating datasets.
 Given the wide applicability of RO-Crate and the lack of practical implementations of FDOs, ELIXIR (Harrow et al. 2021) co-opted this initiative as the project to define a common format for research data exchange and repository entries. Thus, during the last year it’s been implemented in a wide range of services, such as: WorkflowHub (Goble et al. 2021) (a registry for describing, sharing and publishing scientific computational workflows) uses RO-Crates as an exchange format to improve reproducibility of computational workflows that follow the Workflow RO-Crate profile (Bacall et al. 2022); LifeMonitor (Leo et al. 2022) (a service to support the sustainability of computational workflows being developed as part of the EOSC-Life project) uses RO-Crate as an exchange format for describing test suites associated with workflows. 
 Tools have been developed towards aiding the previously mentioned use cases and increasing the general usability of RO-Crates by providing a user-friendly (programmatic) interface for consumption and production of RO-Crates through programmatic libraries for consuming/producing RO-Crates (ro-crate-py De Geest et al. 2022, ro-crate-ruby Bacall and Whitwell 2022, ro-crate-js Lynch et al. 2021).
 The Galaxy project provides a research environment with data analysis and data management functionalities as a multi user platform, aiming to make computational biology accessible to research scientists that do not have computer programming or systems administration experience. As such, it stores not just analysis related data but also the complete analytical workflow, including its metadata. The internal data model involves the history entity, including all steps performed in a specific analysis, and the workflow entity, defining the structure of an analytical pipeline. From the start, Galaxy aims to enable reproducible analyses by providing capabilities to export (and import) all the analysis history details and workflow data and metadata in a FAIR way. As such it helps its users with the daily research data management. The Galaxy community is continuously improving and adding features, the integration of the FAIR Digital Object principles is a natural next step in this. 
 To be able to support these FDOs, Galaxy leverages the RO-Crate Python client library (De Geest et al. 2022) and provides multiple entry points to import and export different research data objects representing its internal entities and associated metadata. These objects include:
 
 
 
 a workflow definition, which is used to share/publish the details of an analysis pipeline, including the graph of tools that need to be executed, and metadata about the data types required
 
 
 individual data files or a collection of datasets related to an analysis history
 
 
 a compressed archive of the entire analysis history including the metadata associated with it such as the tools used, their versions, the parameters chosen, workflow invocation related metadata, inputs, outputs, license, author, CWLProv description (Khan et al. 2019) of the workflow, contextual references in the form of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), ‘EMBRACE Data And Methods’ ontology (EDAM) terms (Ison et al. 2013), etc.

 The adoption of RO-crate by Galaxy allows a standardised exchange of FDOs with other platforms in the ELIXIR Tools ecosystem, such as WorkflowHub and LifeMonitor. Integrating RO-Crate deeply into Galaxy and offering import and export options of various Galaxy objects such as Research Objects allows for increased standardisation, improved Research Data Management (RDM) functionalities, smoother user experience (UX) as well as improved interoperability with other systems. The integration in a platform used by biologists to do data intensive analysis, facilitates the publication of workflows and workflow invocations for all skill levels and democratises the ability to perform Open Science.",Research Ideas and Outcomes,2022.0,3,"{'url': 'https://riojournal.com/article/95164/download/pdf/', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/rio.8.e95164?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.8.e95164, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

bcf8acffc78f5c704109e8284d7dc936102da065,CARJ Editor’s Award 2022,"The Editor’s Award of the Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal recognizes research papers that represent novelty, quality, importance and which have potential high scientific and clinical impact. The award winner is determined by the Selection Committee, which is comprised of members of the CARJ Editorial Board and Standing Committee. This year, papers which were published between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2020 were given consideration for the award. In 2022, the CARJ Editor’s Award is given to the manuscript entitled ‘Sample-Size Determination Methodologies for Machine Learning in Medical Imaging Research: A Systematic Review’ by Indranil Balki, Afsaneh Amirabadi, Jacob Levman, Anne L. Martel, Ziga Emersic, Blaz Meden, Angel Garcia-Pedrero, Saul C. Ramirez, Dehan Kong, Alan R. Moody and Pascal N. Tyrrel. Position statements by radiologic associations have highlighted that adequate sample-size considerations are essential to ensure robust, unbiased clinical model development for machine learning (ML) studies. The generalizability of ML algorithms for classification tasks are highly dependent on the size and quality of the training data set on which they are trained. This is particularly relevant for ML methods applied to the field of diagnostic radiology where access to large quantities of high-quality data is challenging. The authors sought to provide a systematic review of sample-size determination methodologies in ML applied to medical imaging based on articles published between 1946 and 2018. The authors found a paucity of research in training set size determination methodologies applied to ML in medical imaging, highlighting the need for additional research in this area. Balki et al is a meaningful contribution to the body of literature that informs efforts to standardize reporting practices and methodologies at the intersection of computer science, machine learning and clinical research.

BepiColombo a joint project between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) consists of two orbiters, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (Mio). It will perform measurements to increase our knowledge on the fundamental questions about Mercury&#8217;s evolution, composition, interior, magnetosphere, and exosphere. &#160;</p><p>During its 7-year long journey to the innermost terrestrial planet Mio and MPO are connected to each on-top of the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM). The MTM contains a solar electric propulsion engine and will bring the two spacecraft to Mercury. In late 2025, this &#8216;stack&#8217; configuration is abandoned, the MTM will be jettisoned and the individual elements spacecraft are brought in to their final Mercury orbit: 480x1500km for MPO, and 590x11640km for Mio. &#160;</p><p>On its way BepiColombo with its state of the art and very comprehensive payload has several opportunities for scientific observations - during the cruise into the inner solar system and during its nine planetary flybys (one at Earth, two at Venus and six at Mercury). However, since the spacecraft is in a stacked configuration not all of the instruments can be operated during the cruise phase.</p><p>Some of the instruments have been already operated regularly or partially during the flybys in their &#8220;scientific&#8221; observation mode: e.g. the magnetometer (MPO-MAG), the accelerometer (ISA), the environmental sensor (BERM), the gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer (MGNS), the solar intensity x-ray and particle spectrometer (SIXS), the radio science experiment (MORE), using the X-band and the Ka-band, the thermal infrared spectrometer (MERTIS), the UV spectrometer (PHEBUS) and some sensors of the SERENA suite. Also, instruments or some parts of the instruments of the Japanese Mio spacecraft like the dust monitor (MDM), the plasma wave instrument (PWI), the particle and plasma experiments of MPPE and the magnetometer (MGF) were already successfully operated in their science modes. BepiColombo also took regular &#8220;selfie&#8221; images with their three monitoring cameras on the MTM. These cameras were also able to take a sequence of outreach images during the flybys at Earth and Venus in 2020. Other instruments such as cameras and NIR spectrometer (SIMBIO-SYS), the laser altimeter (BELA), the x-ray spectrometer (MIXS), and parts of the electron, neutron, and iron sensors of SERENA on MPO and MSASI and some dedicated sensors of PWI and MPPE are operational, but can only be used in their scientific modes after the Mercury in-orbit commissioning in early 2026 because their field of view is blocked by the underlying Transfer Module.</p><p>Despite the reduced instrument availability, scientific and engineering operations has been scheduled during the cruise phase, especially during the swing-bys.

Organized by Asia Pacific Institute of Science and Engineering and media supported by MDPI-Information, CMVIT 2022 strives to offer networking opportunities to meet and interact with the world-leading scientists, engineers and researchers as well as industrial partners in machine vision and information technologies. CMVIT has been held for five years since 2017 after four successful onsite conferences in Singapore, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Sanya till 2020 and one virtual conference in 2021. As the sixth event, CMVIT 2022 continues to provide a unique and excellent forum to exchange research methodologies, explore practical applications, and foster innovative ideas, in machine vision and information technology. The conference was originally scheduled in Haikou, China from in February 2022. Due to the COVID-19 situation in China, most authors cannot attend offline. It had to be turned into a fully virtual conference via Tencent meeting. Moreover, as authors wished to attend the conference as scheduled, for the sake of academic exchange and publication request, the conference was held on Feb. 25, 2022 as virtual conference, instead of postponement. The proceedings of this year’s edition consist of 3 main categories: Information Technology, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. The research tracks attracted 75 submissions, among which 41 were accepted, including countries like Canada, Malaysia, UK, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, China, etc. All the submissions were rigorously reviewed by the Program Committee (PC). In the full-day conference, 16 oral presentations were made in two sessions and 25 posters were demonstrated in the single poster session. For each presentation, warm discussion and Q&A were followed. We have also selected 1 best paper award, 1 best poster award, and 2 best oral presentation awards. One plenary speaker Prof. Yingxu Wang from Canada, and 2 keynote speakers Prof. Dongbing Zhao and Prof. Zenglin Xu from China were invited to share their latest and insightful research ideas in the conference. We sincerely thank all the authors for submitting their papers to our conference.

6572efb124f9f0801f2ee85ca13e625baa663530,Lemons into Lemonade!,"This paper discusses a trial of offering two senior/first-year graduate classes in a 7-week format, one following the other. Thus, a student could complete two courses (6-credits), dealing with two closely related topics, in one semester. In this case, the courses were Digital Communication Systems and Wireless Communications. During the first week of the first 7-week course, all of the in-class demonstrations and hands-on experiences needed to be shifted to online/remote delivery. This was primarily accomplished using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) AppStream, cloud computing system. The planned real-world signal capture and analysis project changed to an optional attendance of a technical conference. All of our students choose to attend this conference at their own expense. This paper will discuss these challenges and provide a selected assessment. Introduction The authors present one pre-COVID planned experiment and three COVID changes necessary to support senior and first-year graduate Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) courses. 1. The pre-COVID experiment was based on offering two senior and first-year graduate classes in a 7-week format, one following the other. Thus, a student could complete two courses (6-credits), in one semester, dealing with two closely related topics. In this case, the courses were Digital Communication Systems and Wireless Communications. 2. The first of the COVID changes dealt with a lesson-one pivot to all instruction being online. This was due to a unanimous preference by the enrolled undergraduate students. 3. The second change resulted from all instruction going online. Hands-on operation of a hardware vector signal analyzer (VSA hardware) and software-based vector signal analysis (VSA software) of real-world digital communication signals was no longer possible. 4. The third change resulted from University Administration promulgated guidance saying, “It's okay to take a review day, to reassign class time for students to work on a project, or to reduce student workload.” This led to the alternate strategy of participation in a virtually-delivered technical conference by all enrolled students. More details regarding these changes, and the course outcome, are given below. 7-week, Back-to-Back Course Offerings The planning for this trial was completed in the Fall of 2019 (pre-COVID); however, during the Spring of 2020 when our university pivoted to all classes going online, most of these plans began to unravel. After interviewing all of our engineering students at the end of the Spring semester, it became very clear that our upper division ECE students did not prefer online/remote engineering education. Accordingly, plans were made to hold these new 7-week trial classes in a face-to-face manner. This was the first offering of the Digital Communication Systems course; the course overview and learning outcomes are provided below. Course overview: “An introduction to digital communication systems focusing on the physical layer (PHY). A review of concepts including Shannon theory, Nyquist sampling theory, optimal detection under Gaussian white noise, and various modulation schemes. Building blocks of a digital receiver, including time and frequency synchronization, equalization and precoding, error-correction coding/decoding, and the available tools using vector signal analysis (VSA) techniques. Exposure to some advanced communication technologies such as Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and 5G systems.” Learning Outcomes: After taking this course, you will be able to: • Design a digital transmitter in MATLAB • Design a simplified digital receiver in MATLAB • Be able to analyze and identify various modulation schemes using VSA software • Test/characterize your transmitter using VSA software • Test your transceiver system in MATLAB Additionally, two practicing engineers wanted to take the Digital Communication Systems course, but could not attend in-person due to fact that with the class starting at noon, it conflicted with their work hours. Additionally, due to the 7-week format, the traditional one hour and 15minute class period extended to two hours and 30 minutes with a break in between the back-toback scheduling periods. This required an online-only section to allow these practicing engineers to participate in the class. The Lesson One Pivot to Online Only An unintended consequence of creating the online-only section for the practicing engineers was that all of the enrolled graduate students shifted their enrollment into this section. This meant that the only students actually attending the face-to-face class were the undergraduate students. Remembering that just a few months ago, upper division ECE students expressed the opinion that they did not prefer online/remote engineering education, this was not viewed as a problem and the course proceeded as planned. However, during the first class meeting (lesson one), the undergraduate students unanimously requested that the course be delivered online. The VSA Hardware and Software Student Experience With all instruction now online, hands-on operation of the VSA hardware and VSA software as originally envisioned was no longer possible. Real-time in-class videos helped explain the hardware issues and 30-day trial versions of the Keysight VSA software began to solve the software concern. However, with access to the VSA software needing to span the entire semester, other solutions were needed. The Boise State University College of Engineering (COEN) Information Technology Services (ITS) department had already put in place the AppStream remote hosting system made available by Amazon Web Services (AWS). This remote access to several engineering software tools was serendipitously put in place for the Spring 2020 semester. As shown in Figure 1, these were the programs available to COEN students during the Fall 2020 semester. Figure 1. College of Engineering programs available remotely using AWS AppStream. During the first week of the 7-week semester, all of the in-class demonstrations and hands-on experiences, with numerous pieces of radio frequency (RF) test and measurement equipment (T&ME), the commDSK app within the winDSK8 program [1-5], signal acquisition, using a vector signal analyzer, and analysis using state-of-the-art vector signal analysis software, were shifted to online/remote delivery. This was primarily accomplished using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Appstream, cloud computing system. AppStream also handled the license server issues associated with the VSA software. Additionally, the Keysight VSA software only runs on a Window-based computer [6]. One student only had a Mac, so the AWS AppStream option also solved this problem. Student homework emphasized MATLAB creation and analysis of a number of digital communication signals. Eventually, these signals were played through a computer sound card and captured by the VSA hardware operating in baseband mode. The VSA software recorded the signals and the recorded files were returned to the student for analysis. Thus, the students accomplished almost all of the course’s original VSA instructional objectives. A typical student result is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Student generated, 16-QAM signal being analyzed using the VSA hardware and software. Reassigning Class Time The planned hands-on, real-world signal capture and analysis project was shifted to the optional attendance of a technical conference. Serendipity had struck, and the IEEE DSP Online Conference was available for only $20 per person for early registration [7]. No student discounts were offered. This was a single track, 2-day event, 12 hours per day, and was extremely well done. Presentations were very helpful and/or tutorial for most students. About 500 attendees registered, as compared to thousands for a premier IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) event such as the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP). fred harris (yes, he does not believe in capitalization of his name), the author of a well-known multirate signal processing textbook [8, 9], was presenting two sessions at this conference. Reference [9] was published after these courses were completed. Attending this conference was optional, but if a student chose not to attend, they would need to complete a multi-rate signal processing assignment. All of the students choose to attend this conference at their own expense. For another comparison, the IEEE Power and Energy Society (PES) General Meeting (GM) cost $100 to attend virtually this past Summer. The last PES GM that the author attended in Portland, OR, cost a few thousand dollars. This may not be a fair comparison, since this is comparing a two-day, single-track event to 5-day, multi-track event. Post-conference discussions were held during class. One double class period (2.5 hours of educational class time) became about 24-hours of available educational content. This was one of the least expensive ways that the authors had ever accumulated so many professional development hours (PDHs) so quickly and inexpensively. PDHs are required in most states of the U.S. to maintain an active professional engineering (PE) license. During the second 7-week, Wireless Communications course, all the students participated in the 3rd IEEE Workshop on 5G Technologies for First Responder and Tactical Networks, cosponsored by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate. This was a free, 1-day, 6-track event, with 13 patron breakout sessions. Students choose which track they attended. Assessment While the authors are firm believers in the utility of assessment, given the small class size (10, half undergraduate and half graduate students), the following results are, at best, anecdotal in nature. In addition to the traditional end-of-course evaluations conducted by the university, the students were als",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37433?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37433, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As the 2018 SAMSES did, this year’s SAMSES put more focus on the implementation of STEM in elementary school settings. In addition, it also provides an interdisciplinary forum for either educators or policy makers to present and discuss current innovations, developments, practical challenges, as well as potential solutions to issues in the fields of STEM for elementary school children. However, unlike that in the year 2018, the commencement of this year’s SAMSES was on a virtual mode due to the uncertainty of the global pandemic of COVID-19. The plenary session had three speakers from international affiliations with a variety of expertise, namely Dr. I. Gusti Darmawan from Adelaide University, Australia; Prof. Dr. Didi Suryadi, M.Ed. from Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, Indonesia; and Assoc. Prof. Wang Qiyun from National Institute of Education, Singapore and the parallel session had 166 participants from various institutions and countries. All the sessions were utilizing Zoom Meetings and despite the virtual mode, all the presenters showed admirable enthusiasm on the fruitful discussions. The committee finally decided to have the seminar virtually instead of postponing it as the pandemic had not given any certainty. Additionally, some of the presenters were Ph.D. students who needed to have their presentation on an international event and their publication on a reputable platform this year. Out of 136 manuscripts submitted to the committee, merely 65 manuscripts were accepted to be submitted for publication to JPCS IOP due to their quality in either the content (scope of the manuscripts), layout, or the language. The manuscripts mainly discussed such issues as educational studies in mathematics, physics education, science teaching kit, engineering for kids, robotic and game teaching in elementary school, electronics for kits, computer-based learning, computer programming for kinds, and foundation of engineering, technology, and robotics. We do hope this volume gives significant contribution to the field of STEM for elementary school settings. Last but not least, we would like to express our most sincere gratitude to the international advisory board, scientific, committee, and organizing committee for their hard work to make the seminar possible despite the pandemic. We also would like to thank all the speakers, presenters, and participants for showing no decrease of enthusiasm on the discussion as well as publication process of the seminar. Looking forward to seeing you all on the next SAMSES and we do hope everybody stays safe and healthy. The Editors Iwan Kustiawan, Ph.D. Dr. Isma Widiaty, M.Pd. Dr. Julia, M.Pd.

195b885d18908db48cb99075bb959df5bc4bf10f,Editorial: Fundamentals and Applications of AI: An Interdisciplinary Perspective,"Machines, computers, and algorithms appear recurrently in the future imagined in science fiction pieces. Terminator’s Skynet, Space Odyssey’s HAL 9000, Psychohistory of Asimov’s Foundation, and Westworld’s Dolores are just a few examples of our collective imaginary of a (days) topic future. Interestingly, the year 2019 has represented the future in some works. Toronto Star in 1983 asked Asimov to predict the future, the world of 2019. This is also the case for Blade Runner, where the action runs in a dystopic LA, in 2019, with replicants having “almost” human cognitive capabilities. Although we have not reached most of the utopian pictures, the growth of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence algorithms is unquestionable (Figure 1). Thus, celebrating the unstoppable advance of AI, we collect in this RT several studies addressing fundaments and applications from a physics perspective. In 2020, AI has continued its penetration into classical fields and emerging technologies. Fueled by deep learning and the automatic generation of data, the techniques developed in AI are being applied to predict and control physical, biological, engineering, and even commercial systems. Given the two-way interaction between AI and different fields and including how these fields inspire novel methods and theory in AI, we had envisioned a volume illustrating such an interdisciplinary perspective. Contributions include quantum annealers and quantum neural networks, echo state networks, machine learning (reinforcement learning and graph-based methods), and applications to optimization, classification of heartbeats, animal collective movement, and climate forecast, and the use of AI to discover physical laws. A fast machine learning model for ECG-based heartbeat classification and arrhythmia detection was developed, based on echo state networks [1]. The classifier requires a small number of features and a single ECG signal suffices. The possibility of using a combination of ensembles allows them to exploit parallelism to train the classifier with remarkable speed. The sensitivity and predictive values are comparable with those of the state of the art in fully automatic ECG classifiers and even outperform other ECG classifiers that follow more complex feature selection approaches. Reservoir computers are investigated in two contributions. First, a coherent all-optical fiber-ring reservoir computer with distributed Kerr nonlinearity is investigated numerically and experimentally [2]. The system is based on a passive coherent optical fiber-ring cavity where part of the nonlinearity is due to the Kerr effect.

6077db0e71b4356d50812566a8df46c56ccb5b40,Stunting in Indonesian Children and Its Contributing Factors: Study through Bibliometric Analysis,"Children's stunting is a problem because it is associated with an increased risk of pain and death, suboptimal brain development resulting in late motor development, and inhibition of mental growth. This study aims to examine the factors that influence the occurrence of stunting and risk in children in Indonesia. The research method used is a traditional review. The results of the review found that many factors cause the high incidence of stunting in toddlers, including energy intake, birth weight, maternal knowledge level, family economic status, parental parenting, and food security. WHO estimates the prevalence of stunting worldwide at 22 percent or as many as 149.2 million in 2020. According to the Indonesian Nutritional Status Study (SSGI) results of the Ministry of Health, the prevalence of stunting in children under five in Indonesia reached 24.4% in 2021. The prevalence of stunting of toddlers in Indonesia continues to show a decline. In 2018 the prevalence of stunting toddlers was still 30.8%. Then, it dropped to 27.7 in 2019 and continued to fall to 24.4% in SSGI 2024. The government even targets to drop to 14% by the end of 2024. Furthermore, WHO also recommends reducing stunting by 3.9% per year to meet the target of 40% stunting reduction by 2025.

5034c1ab626370aaf5a8ff09939a006818dd310d,Journal of Generic Medicines – Editorial September 2021,"Many industry observers are now taking this opportunity to communicate their view of the future. IQVIA anticipates the spending on all medicines will grow at 3–6% through to 2025 reaching a total global market of $1600 billion. This includes Covid vaccine sales of $157 billion. Developing countries will grow in double-digits led by Russia, Pakistan, Vietnam, India, Brazil, China and faster than most developed countries. Oncology and immunology medicines are also expected to grow in double digits as a result of better access and new treatments. Indeed, the number of New Active Substances (NAS) introductions is expected to be above normal at around 60 per year. The International Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association have published their vision of the future and assessed today’s value of the global generic Industry at $390 billion. Generic medicines represent a 60–80% share of all the medicines consumed in many key countries with an even higher share of 90% in the USA and India. More importantly, the disease burden on patients in India and Africa has now dropped by more than 35% over the last 25 years though access to generic medicines. Another research company has projected that the global generic industry will reach $508 billion by 2026. The small molecule segment will reach $325 billion alongside the biosimilar segment at $183 billion. The two largest generic markets are expected to be the USA at $116 billion and China at $91billion. Astonishingly, the UK government has ignored the generic medicines industry in its new 10-year strategy for the life sciences sector whilst every day it depends on the industry for its daily supply of medicines to pharmacies, hospitals and doctor surgeries in the UK. In the last quarter, some Asian generic companies showed encouraging prescription trends. The generic prescriptions in the USA market filled by the Indian Pharmaceutical companies showed a 6% year on year growth (excluding vaccines). Meanwhile several western generic companies fell short of their historical 2020 results and seem to be facing competitive challenges with the USA pricing erosion remaining high in the mid-single digits. On Covid, one of the vaccine challenges has been to determine if the third booster vaccination will be needed just once or every year. Many generic companies have been in-licensing Covid vaccines and treatments from around the world. One generic company has even negotiated five separate licences for covid treatments including the mabs, the nibs and the virs. The Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients market is expected to be driven by high potency molecules in the future, but is currently facing a significant rise in raw material costs. In addition, packaging costs have doubled and the freight costs from China have tripled. As a consequence, the number of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients imported into India from China are reducing. Furthermore, product discontinuations resulting from trace nitrosamines have continued in South Korea and Canada with the antismoking medicines.

4348367b9930a1c6f75a99201f438a2ecfa11d91,Relaxing Mask Mandates in New Jersey,"Photo by Mika Baumeister on Unsplash
INTORDUCTION
In March of 2022, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced that the state would no longer mandate face masks for students, staff, and visitors at schools and childcare centers. Two-thirds of New Jersey residents already supported this decision.[1] Soon after, Princeton University led the way in learning to live with the virus by making the use of masks optional in most situations. At a time when vaccination rates were already high and Omicron hospitalization rates were falling, the decision to relax mask mandates was the right call. 
Yet, Rutgers University has extended its mask mandate for the rest of the academic year, with no stated endpoint. In a university-wide email, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Antonio Calcado announced:

The university has been clear that the science and data would guide our path forward with respect to the health and safety of our community… Use of appropriate face coverings will still be required in all teaching spaces (classrooms, lecture halls, seminar rooms, etc.), teaching labs, computer labs, buses, libraries, and clinical facilities.[2]

Despite the university’s purported commitment to follow “the science and data,” there has been a noticeable lack of transparency regarding the scientific rationale and official endpoint for this extension of the mask mandate.
Given the same set of scientific data available, these neighboring universities came to opposite conclusions on the need for continued mask mandates. Notably, the Rutgers mask mandate continues to require students to mask in libraries but not in crowded cafeterias. These discrepancies have led to understandable frustration among members of the Rutgers community. In response, the Rutgers student newspaper objects to “the sense of optics” and “the lack of clear communication,” resulting in “confusion,” arguing that the university administration “needs to be more transparent” and “must communicate and explain the policy changes more effectively.”[3] At a time when trust in public health institutions is at an all-time low, Ava Kamb warns that a lack of transparent messaging can reduce public trust even further.[4] Instead, Kamb argues that public health mandates should use the least restrictive means necessary in order to promote health and civil liberties at the same time.
The ethical question is whether university mask mandates should be relaxed. I argue that the use of face masks by healthy individuals has uncertain benefits, which potential harms may outweigh, and should therefore be voluntary.
ANALYSIS
Rutgers intends “the science and data” to guide its path forward. As such, it is worth revisiting the controversial science behind mask mandates. From 2019 to 2020, systematic reviews by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections concluded that the use of face masks by healthy individuals in the community lacks effectiveness in reducing viral transmission based on moderate-quality evidence.[5] Neither study concerned COVID-19 specifically. Since then, the only two randomized controlled trials of face masks published during the pandemic found little to no benefit.[6] Yet, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cite many observational and modeling studies (based on empirical assumptions) which suggest that community masking is beneficial.[7] These studies support a larger benefit associated with masking, but they use less reliable research methods. Based on these non-randomized data and mechanistic plausibility, WHO’s current position is also supportive of community masking recommendations. But without high-quality evidence, it is difficult to justify a requirement rather than a recommendation.
It may be useful to draw an ethical distinction between a recommendation and a mandate in public health. A public health recommendation does not generally undermine individual autonomy because individuals have the choice to follow the recommendation. I argue that recommendations may be justified by a lower standard of proof or a lesser expected benefit precisely because they do not violate individual autonomy. On the other hand, a public health mandate demands compliance using the threat of penalty. To ethically justify an infringement of autonomy, strong evidence that demonstrates a significant health benefit should support a public health mandate. While the recommendation to use masks in accordance with personal preference may be a reasonable precaution—particularly for vulnerable individuals—the higher standards of evidence and benefit that would ethically justify mask mandates have not been met.
Notwithstanding, one might argue the precautionary principle justifies mask mandates. For example, Chinese CDC Director-General George Gao, medical researcher Trisha Greenhalgh, and others espouse such a view.[8] The precautionary principle holds that it is better to be safe than sorry. In the context of COVID-19, the principle has been used to advocate for public health measures which lack high-quality evidence. Accordingly, it might be thought that it is safer to implement potentially ineffective mask mandates than to risk forgoing a lifesaving benefit. Yet, the precautionary principle is an ill-defined concept that is philosophically problematic. Health economist Jay Bhattacharya and epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta argue that the precautionary principle cuts both ways because a public health mandate without high-quality evidence has both potential benefits and potential harms.[9] If the precautionary principle can justify implementing mask mandates due to the risk of forgoing possible benefit, then it might also be able to justify not implementing mask mandates due to the risk of potential harm caused by the intervention.
It is commonly thought that there is little to lose from the use of face masks, but this is not necessarily true. According to WHO, CDC, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the harms of face masks may include headaches, difficulty breathing, skin lesions, difficulty communicating, a false sense of security, environmental pollution, impaired learning, delayed psychosocial development, and disadvantages for individuals with cognitive or mental disorders.[10] These include both potential and observed harms drawn from the scientific literature. Yet, the negative side effects of masks remain significantly under-investigated. For example, there is emerging mechanistic evidence that prolonged mask use or reuse increases both inhaled and environmental microplastics, the long-term effects of which are unknown.[11] The harms related to communication, learning, and psychosocial development are particularly problematic for educational institutions, whose mission is to promote these very things. It is, therefore, possible that masks have done more harm than good.
While many observational studies and models support the potential benefits of masks, some interpret these studies to mean that masks clearly work. However, the limited body of randomized data paints a less optimistic picture and cannot be used to rule out an increase in infection from masks.[12] Other types of studies, less reliable research methods, do rule this out and support masking. Bhattacharya and Gupta would argue that it is safer to encourage voluntary, evidence-based interventions than to foist these potential harms upon individuals for the sake of uncertain benefits.
It remains unclear whether and to what extent the use of face masks by healthy individuals in the community influenced COVID-19 mortality. However, it is clear to me that community masking does not meet the higher standard of evidence necessary to justify a mandate and that mask use is associated with potential harm. The already tenuous case for masks continues to weaken with a mixed body of evidence, the availability of effective pharmaceuticals, and widespread natural immunity to COVID-19. If public health should aim for the least restrictive means necessary to promote health while respecting civil liberties, then the extension of burdensome mask mandates which lack high-quality evidence is ethically problematic.
CONCLUSION
Given the current state of COVID-19, a university mask mandate for a low-risk population with high levels of immunity is not justified. In times of fear and uncertainty, higher education institutions ought to make reasoned policy decisions guided by “the science and data.” It would seem that, of the universities that mandated masks, Princeton has emerged as a national leader in mask policy while Rutgers lags behind. Schools across the nation should take note.

As always, the PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE team looks forward to bringing to you the most exciting developments and emerging trends in electrical engineering and computer science through our lineup of next year’s special issues and articles. Before diving into the details about these exciting topics, I would like to highlight some of the achievements of 2019. I started off 2019 as the new Editorin-Chief of the PROCEEDINGS, and the journey so far has been quite fulfilling. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the editorial board, authors, and the guest editors of the PROCEEDINGS who are truly the cornerstones for constructing the success of the journal. Thanks to their spectacular job, the PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE is truly the most exemplary journal of the IEEE in terms of the quality of content we bring to the readership. The PROCEEDINGS strives for excellence in many ways, and bibliometrics is just one way to measure the journal’s success. For instance, according to the 2018 Journal Citation Reports (JCR) released in June 2019 by Clarivate Analytics, the PROCEEDINGS received an impact factor of 10.694 and an article influence score of 3.432, thus ranking no. 5 by impact factor and no. 4 by article influence score in the electrical and electronic engineering category. Things do not change much if one refers to Elsevier Scopus. The PROCEEDINGS’ Citescore indicator is 10.79, which corresponds to a ranking of 10 over 658 journals in the electrical and electronic engineering category in Scopus. Apart from this, the usage for PROCEEDINGS articles continues to grow, indicating wide interest in the content published by the journal. The PROCEEDINGS is no doubt successful at what it does; however, without changing with the times, it is not possible to continue this success—changing often is the only way to maintain and improve the quality of the journal. With this mind, I have initiated a number of changes for the PROCEEDINGS this year in conjunction with the editorial staff, some of which I have outlined in the following. 1) Regular Paper Submission Process: An essential component of the journal’s offerings is the regular papers on more focused topics, giving readers",International Endodontic Journal,1929.0,0,"{'url': 'https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/s1-10/37/47.full.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1136/jnnp.s1-10.37.47?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.s1-10.37.47, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

74b7c31e8a97e70cdafbea6befc7acdc3f9579ce,Online Engineering Bridge Summer Program Created and Focused on Preparing Students for Calculus,"The Louisiana State University Bridge to Engineering Excellence (BEE) Program was developed in response to the cancelation of an in-person minority focused university wide-residential bridge program due to COVID-19 in 2020, and it is a work in progress. The BEE program has been continued each summer to provide preparation for incoming students who cannot participate or choose not to participate in a traditional in-person full-time bridge program. BEE program goals through all three summers has been to provide first-year engineering and computer science students review and preparation for differential and integral calculus, build connections with current successful engineering students, and introduce skills for becoming a successful student in STEM courses. The ultimate desired outcome is to increase retention and improve academic performance, particularly in math courses. The initial major concern when creating the program was that incoming students would not be prepared for college-level calculus due to lack of any bridge opportunities. The BEE program includes synchronous math classes over six weeks, required daily tutoring sessions, and weekly academic and professional success workshops. The BEE program is taught online by university-based PhD mathematics faculty with extensive experience in these fields The calculus class topics include inverse functions, logarithms, trigonometry, limits and continuity, differentiation, applications of differentiation, integration, and applications of integration. Initially, the course material was presented in a PowerPoint format, and based on student and tutor feedback this evolved to presenting all materials using an iPad in conjunction with the app GoodNotes. This iPad format has several advantages including material being presented in a classical ‘whiteboard-like’ setting, and giving the presentation a more traditional theme, and a format that allows for recording, posting, and editing the virtual class for future study. The class structure also utilized breakout rooms to change the pace and encourage interaction with other class members and tutors. Another change was the use of mandatory quizzes and final exam. Although, the course ‘grades’ were not ‘real,’ it gave students immediate feedback on their level of knowledge and simulated a credit course providing more motivation, thus, increasing student participation in the assessments. Another element of the program was daily one-hour tutoring sessions and these have been a part of the program from the beginning.

617e8b3f84b245eb03f3bddff71d6a1566fe33a7,Statistical Analysis of Weather Parameters for Sustainable Flight Operation in Nigeria,"Abstract The recent complications in the weather system, which oftentimes lead to flight cancellation, delay and diversion have become a critical issue in Nigeria. This study however considers the weather related parameters and their impacts on flight disruption in the country. Weather data (on thunderstorm, wind speed and direction, visibility and cloud cover) and flight data (delay, cancellation and diversion) were collected from Murtala International Airport, Ikeja-Lagos, Nigeria. The data covered the period between 2005 and 2020. However, Regional Climate Models (RCMs) were also used to run climate data projections between year 2020 and 2035 in the study region. The study employed Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software for the descriptive and inferential analysis. Time series analysis, Pearson Moment Correlation for interrelationship among the weather parameters and the flight disruption data, and multiple linear regression analysis were applied to determine the influence of weather parameters on flight disruption data. Results show that cloud cover and high visibility are negatively correlated. Wind speed has positive relationship with wind direction; and an inverse relationship between visibility, thunderstorm, and fog. Direct relationship exists between highest visibility and thick dust, wind speed and cloud cover. Thick dust, wind speed and cloud cover indicate increased visibility level in the study area. Flight delay is prominent over flight diversion and cancellation, which indicates their relevance in air traffic of the study area. The prediction model indicates high degree of cloud cover at the beginning of every year and later declines sharply in 2035, the visibility flattens out by the year 2025, and low pattern of thick dust was calculated in the same pattern in 2011, 2016 and 2027. Based on this conclusion, the study recommends accurate weather reporting and strict compliance to safety regulations, and attention should be paid to changing pattern of weather parameters in order to minimize fight related disasters.",Journal of Environmental Geography,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ojs.bibl.u-szeged.hu/index.php/jengeo/article/download/43715/42695', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2478/jengeo-2021-0011?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2478/jengeo-2021-0011, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

170dd6ab5220855176ca51c08e2e3ae6b2e0a5a1,NEW TRENDS IN MANAGING OUR FOREIGN LANGUAGE (VIRTUAL) CLASSROOM IN PANDEMIC TIMES,"Teaching languages in pandemic times takes on both pedagogical and technological challenges. This is the moment where teachers and students explore and adapt to a new environment. This is a place (shall we call it a ""cyberspace""?) where tradition has to be reconsidered more closely and facilitate significant innovations. The year 2020 will be remembered as a turnaround point in human modern history for many scientific domains. Teaching languages in schools is facing big challenges alongside with other teaching subjects (arts, humanities, natural sciences). Nonetheless, (foreign) language teaching gives teachers even in a restricted teaching environment (confinement restrictions, enforced lockdowns of varying degrees) a certain flexibility in managing the ,,virtual classroom"". Students can acquire in times of restrictions languages, as long as they have an electronic device that enables them to get in touch with a teacher. This also implies the fact that teachers are able to facilitate and control communication within the classroom. Moreover, beyond their (traditional) teaching skills they should also be able to develop a basic competence in the software system. Although online teaching has gained more and more attention in the last decades, it was first in 2020 - as pandemic restrictions had been imposed - that teachers were directly confronted with the need of teaching in front of a personal computer for their students. The object of this paper is therefore to examine online language teaching and set a basic framework of the so called virtual classroom. This examination relies on the fact that there is indeed a gap between traditional face-to-face classroom teaching and online teaching (Compton, 2009). Whereas the teacher is supposed to acquire additional teaching skills in order to face online challenges. Furthermore, the virtual classroom must be restructured, in the sense that traditional classroom ceases to exist once the teacher jumps into the cyberspace. Another interesting issue is cyberspace itself. This should be a space where both teacher and student have profiles and behaviours that stand in clear contrast to their traditional counterparts. A significant feature is the fact that online teaching must reshape traditional teacher-centred strategies and develop a group-centred method, whereas the general frontal view teaching should shift into a more personalised approach. Teachers must be fully aware of the importance of these acts by overcoming their fears and engaging in a constructive dialogue with their students.",eLearning and Software for Education,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.12753/2066-026x-21-038?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.12753/2066-026x-21-038, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

42f2259126661ef87e81f4de7c72ce214256a81b,Build Back Better with Responsible AI,"What a year 2020 was! The worldwide coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has drastically changed our work and social lives and fundamentally altered our understanding of how the world works. However, the pandemic has not only forced us to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances, but also to seek new opportunities and to rethink what the world after COVID-19 could look like. Here, I want to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in building back better—a strategy which aims to mitigate risks posed by future threats. These risks are not limited to those related to COVID-19, but include a whole range of ethical, societal, and environmental issues. Hence, the question is how AI can help us to recover and to reshape our economy and society in a way that is more sustainable and resilient to future disruptions and challenges? In the future, AI will, without a doubt, play a key role in many areas including manufacturing, logistics, transport, education, security, as well as health and social care. Many of the technological challenges that AI research and development will face have been recently described by Kristian Kersting in his editorial “Rethinking Computer Science Through AI” (KI Journal, Issue 4, 2020).1 However, in addition to solving these difficult technical challenges, we also need to ensure that future AI technologies are designed, developed, operated, and used in ways that are not only efficient, safe, and robust but also sustainable, fair, and inclusive to benefit both the society and the environment. Responsible research and innovation (RRI) frameworks2 and tools3 provide guidelines and good practices with the aim to foster the design of inclusive and sustainable research and innovation. Adopting such frameworks for building back better within AI research would help to pro-actively address challenges arising when deploying AI technologies in the wider society. For example, EPSRC’s AREA Framework4 encourages all stakeholders to anticipate and reflect on the consequences of scientific and technological innovations. Furthermore, the framework engages stakeholders through formal and informal processes of dialogue and debate. And finally, the framework uses these processes to act and to influence the direction and trajectory of the research and innovation process itself. Hence, by integrating responsible innovation approaches in the design, manufacturing, operation, repair, and end-of-life recycling of AI systems we can anticipate and mitigate societal, commercial and financial, and environmental risks. Let us consider an example of what RRI could mean when developing AI methods for autonomous driving. What are potential risks and implications that we need to anticipate, reflect on, engage with, and act upon? As a hypothetical example, we could anticipate that the performance of a safety-critical (deep) learning-based model will depend on the characteristics and the type of the environment in which an autonomous vehicle is deployed. If the trained model has a significant lower performance in rural areas compared to urban areas, we could reflect that the deployment of the",KI - Künstliche Intelligenz,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13218-021-00707-9.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7995393, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

00c2b82ac02c64c7ff9dfa10667deabb6e711563,How familiar physics teachers are with the dimensions of technical enlightenment,"The goal of the current research is to identify: - research is to identify the extent of the advanced physics teachers of the preparatory stage with the dimensions of technical enlightenment. This goal is achieved by answering the following question: - Does the level of literacy among middle school physics teachers elevate the dimensions of technical enlightenment to the point of sufficiency (80%) on the scale prepared for this purpose? Where the researcher built a scale with the dimensions of technical enlightenment to measure the extent of mastery of physics teachers for the preparatory stage in the light of indicators presented to a group of experts and specialists to achieve the apparent validity of the scale. The test was on an exploratory sample consisting of (60) teachers and one of the middle school teachers, then the researcher applied the scale to the basic research sample consisting of (100) teachers and schools in the second semester of the academic year (2020-2021) AD, who were intentionally chosen From the governorate center schools, the results showed by using the Statistical Bag for Social Sciences (Spss-10) and (Microsoft excel) the following: - The level of proficiency of middle school physics teachers with dimensions of technical enlightenment is less than the level of proficiency (80%) of the total score of the scale of dimensions of technical enlightenment. In light of the results of the research, the researcher came up with recommendations, including: 1- Take advantage of new programs in the field of technologies, the use of computers and the Internet to be modern sources for teachers' culture content. 2- Holding training courses for physics teachers to familiarize them with the dimensions of technical enlightenment. 3- Recommending teachers in general and physics teachers in particular to work on developing themselves by keeping pace with scientific and technical development and thus benefiting their students.

448292ff7af7ddbe75d13144bf03dbbbd01a39d6,"Providing Support to High School STEM Teachers at Underrepresented Schools Through a Yearlong Professional Development Initiative (WIP, Diversity)","In addition to being an employment requirement for in-service high school educators, professional development (PD) workshops in STEM fields are vital for keeping up with new innovations in both theory and practice. Integrating cross-cutting engineering concepts into a PD STEM program provides a unique opportunity for both teachers and students. Students gain a deeper understanding of individual concepts and the relationship among the components of STEM. Teachers benefit from demonstration of how this integration of concepts can be practically carried out in their classrooms. The goals of the PD institute were to 1) integrate industrial technology, engineering technology and computer science constructs into core math and science high school curriculum (Physical Science, Biology, Chemistry and Physics);2) advance teacher knowledge in the core science subjects with emphasis on misconceptions;3) introduce/reinforce the engineering design process;and 4) due to COVID-19 constraints, to introduce teachers to online simulation platforms for at-home and in-class discovery of scientific concepts. Delivered as a six-day workshop in Summer 2020, the PD institute continued throughout the school year to offer continued support and form a Professional Learning Community (PLC). Due to restrictions from COVID-19, the entire workshop was delivered virtually and instruction was offered to assist with remote delivery of classes and science labs in the upcoming school year. The program covers multidisciplinary engineering science and education technology topics including misconceptions in physical science, misconceptions in biological science, visual programming, CAD and 3D printing, electrical circuit simulation, and overview of online teaching technologies. In addition to instruction and continuing education credit, the teachers received classroom materials to support them in delivering these STEM contents in their schools including a 3D printer for each participating school. This paper represents the current work in progress as part of a comprehensive initiative, which also includes a ten-day summer program for high school students, to serve diverse students and educators from underrepresented communities. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37621.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37621?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37621, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Triton's physical and orbital characteristics make it a unique planetary target for scientific exploration, providing opportunities for investigations in a wide variety of scientific fields, including geomorphological, atmospheric, geophysical, magnetospheric, and ionospheric studies. The science objectives of the Trident mission encompassed an in-depth interior-to-exterior set of objectives, focused on multiple outstanding questions resulting from the 1989 encounter of Voyager 2, and subsequent analysis. Ball Aerospace Corp. was tasked with building the Trident spacecraft, with JPL responsible for providing Engineering Support (Mission Design & Navigation, Mission Planning, Flight Operations, Ground Data Systems, Systems Engineering) and leading Project Management. The observatory would carry a wide-ranging suite of scientific instruments onboard, including an Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) and Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) to be provided by Ball Aerospace Corp., a Wide Angle Camera (WAC) from JPL, a Magnetometer from UCLA, a contributed Plasma Science Suite from IRF (Sweden), and a contributed Radio Science instrument from ASI (Italy). All of these instruments would be used to collect unique datasets during the Triton encounter. Trident would have taken advantage of an ~13-yr, nearly-ballistic trajectory to Triton, utilizing a timely Jupiter Gravity Assist, to execute a 10-day long encounter in the Neptunian system. Launch was planned for October 2025, with Triton arrival scheduled for December 2038. The timeline for this mission would have been sub-divided into seven major phases: Launch, Commissioning, Inner Planet Cruise, Outer Planet Cruise, Approach, Encounter, and Science Data Return. Multiple planetary flybys were planned to be performed during the cruise, including three Earth flybys and one Venus flyby in the Inner Planet Cruise phase, and one Jupiter flyby in the Outer Planet Cruise phase. Along with conventional (Range and Doppler) tracking data, Delta-DOR and Optical Navigation data were also to be acquired to assist with spacecraft navigation during the Approach and Encounter phases. A 3 meter X-Band High Gain Antenna would allow playback of all science data at 1 kbps within 1 year after the Triton Encounter. The Mission Planning element on Trident encompassed and informed multiple aspects of this proposal, ranging from science observation planning during the Triton Encounter phase, to generation of activity timelines for all mission phases; performing ground coverage analysis for science observations to be acquired by all instruments and tracing them to science requirements; evaluation of spacecraft resources including data volume stored onboard, power/energy consumption, telecom (commanding/telemetry) requirements, and overall, working at the interface of science and engineering teams on the mission. All of these functions that were performed by the Mission Planning team on this proposal are discussed in this paper.",IEEE Aerospace Conference,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843368?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843368, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The analysis is based on the Russian Science Citation Index and scientometric indicators: researcher publication activity – yearly number of publications of research findings, citations and penetration of these publications.The author found that almost till the end of the reviewed decade the number of publications and citation had been constantly increasing which evidenced on the increasing interest of Russian researches toward this area not prevented even by the 2014 crisis: at the end of the period, the number of publications outstripped the minimum of 2011 four times, and in 2013, it exceeded the citation maximum two times. The author points to the fact that the highest publication activity and citation of Russian researchers was in the area of quantum computers, and the lowest – in quantum communications; the highest demand was demonstrated in 2012 in quantum communications. The maximum penetration in the area of quantum computers of 2017 is approx. by half and twice lower than the similar indicator in quantum cryptography in 2011 and quantum communications.The relatively low indicators of penetration of research products in 2020 via all vectors are obviously of the same nature as the low citation indexes in 2020: the delayed response of scientific community to current year publications. The highly demanded vectors of studies in various areas of quantum technologies are determined.

8b5fb89bf8b8c5e46ac5ddc3de6d94e5dab7a4a0,Aligning digital literacy and student academic success: Lessons learned from COVID-19 pandemic,"In this paper the alignment of computer and digital literacy as well as student academic success were examined. Lack of adequate functional digital literacy training and the unreadiness of higher education institutions for the impact of random shocks such as COVID-19 pandemic has gravely affected teaching and learning. The purpose of this paper is to make the case for preparedness of students to meet the needs of technology jobs by mandating and aligning digital literacy and student success. As COVID-19 Pandemic was spreading through the communities of the United States, institutions of higher education transitioned to fully online teaching and learning. Prior to the pandemic, fully online education was secondary to face-to-face format. Only about 20% of classes were fully online while 80% were face-to-face. Digital literacy was given a token treatment as a percentage of the entire curriculum and relegated to only the departments of computer information systems and computer sciences. Faculty, students, staff, families, and communities were not trained for the intensity of fully online education as the only format. Many of them never heard of most of the digital literacy tools. Both faculty and students were forced to learn the use of computers and digital literacy tools to survive the spring 2020 semester. Low-income families were left to the operational schedules of local libraries, many of whom did not have internet presence. The institutions provided limited training for faculty and students to meet the urgency of the time. Faculty and students were forced to purchase expensive tools and hardware to withstand the intensive demand of teaching and learning. Many students were overwhelmed by the pressure of the new way of learning; some dropped out of school while many performed very poorly in their examinations which negatively impacted their overall grade point averages. One year later in spring 2021, the student success outcomes have barely changed. At the same time, technology is advancing despite the raging COVID pandemic. Millions of technology-enabled jobs remain unfilled while millions of university graduates are unemployed. There continues to be a mismatch between current job requirements in the industries and graduating students’ skills. This paper discusses the indispensable value of building computer and digital literacy training into all undergraduate curriculums. We argue for mandated computer and digital literacy exit skills assessment test for all graduating students irrespective of their discipline. We also make the case for increased institutional investment in faculty training in computer and digital literacy readiness. There are a number of remedies suggested to address the speed of advancement in technology, faculty and student functional mastery of basic computer and digital literacy skills. We conclude that all institutions must be proactive rather than reactive to systemic shocks by preparing students for academic success and technological readiness for today’s job markets.",The Business and Management Review,2021.0,30,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.24052/bmr/v12nu01/art-26', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.24052/bmr/v12nu01/art-26?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.24052/bmr/v12nu01/art-26, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c3a112529336e68a5137711946373e8f1a3b0107,The Effects of Internet Addiction on Family Relations and School Success in Adolescents,"Objective: This study aimed to determine whether high school adolescents between the ages of 1419 are internet addicts. It also investigates the effects of internet addiction on family harmony and school success. Methods: Our study was conducted between 30 June 2020 1 August 2020 in Istanbul Bağcılar Barbaros Family Health Centre. Firstly, in our study, high school adolescents were asked 29 questions about their socio-demographic status. Then, the Young Internet Addiction Scale consisting of 20 questions and the 5-Question Family Harmony Scale created by Kavikondala et al. were applied. School success was measured verbally via learning the school year-end grade averages. Results: In our study, the internet addiction scale was applied to 183 high school students aged between 14 and 19. We determined that 85.8% of the participants were normal internet users, 13.1% were potential addicts, and 1.1% were addicted. The participants consisted of 100 girls and 83 boys. The total scores of the Internet addiction scale did not show a statistically significant difference between girls and boys. Girls’ school success scores were higher than boys. The students studying at the science high school had higher internet addiction scale scores than other high school groups. Compared to the other groups, the total internet addiction scores were significantly higher in those who have a smartphone, use a smartphone or computer for more than 3 hours daily, and have been using the internet for more than 5 years. The Internet addiction scale scores were significantly higher in individuals with irregular sleep.

99c617e8654b44a160477d2cc2509883608445cc,Modern Language for Modern Circadian Biologists: The End of the “Slave” Oscillator,"323 As I sat at the computer in my living room, I was not entirely shocked at the words on the slide before me. In the spring of 2021, I was in a graduate-level course on neuronal circuits and behavior; I usually attended the virtual class from home before heading into the lab to continue my research on the role of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells on circadian behavior. Naturally, I was thrilled to get to the circadian biology lectures. That day, we discussed the role of the “master” clock in regulating “slave” oscillators throughout the body. As circadian biologists, it’s not unusual to encounter these terms, but that doesn’t mean we should continue using them.1 In his early work, Colin S. Pittendrigh, often dubbed the founder of circadian biology, discussed the light-sensitive A-oscillator and autonomous B-oscillator (Pittendrigh et al., 1958). His co-author on this 1958 paper, Peter Kaus, was a physicist credited with providing mathematical expertise for Pittendrigh’s work. The emergence of the circadian “slave oscillator” appears to originate with Kaus in 1976 (Kaus, 1976), and was likely born from the electronics field where the term had been used since at least the 1940s (Alsberg and Leed, 1949). Master-slave terminology likely caught on because it was an “easy” metaphor, and at the time, “there were few Black engineers to object,” says ethno-mathematician Ron Eglash (All Together, Society of Women Engineers, 2020). Over the past 50 years, generations of circadian biologists have been taught these terms, and their use should not be a source of individual blame. However, we scientists have a duty to overcome the role science has played in the United States’s continued history of racism2 (Nobles et al., 2022). We are trained in the importance of precise language and leaving a rigorous path to follow. With a new generation of scientists comes new expectations for the way we communicate and conduct ourselves. Eliminating the “slave” oscillator won’t undo years of scientific racism, but perhaps it can be one less reason a prospective student might not come our way. It’s encouraging that it’s already more common to see the phrase “peripheral” oscillator than “slave” oscillator in research articles (Figure 1). Yet it would be remiss to attribute the growth in “peripheral” oscillators simply to changes in societal thinking. Rather, scientific advancements in the 1990s elucidated the autonomous nature of circadian oscillators proposed decades before (Pittendrigh et al., 1958). Isolated neurons were shown to retain circadian rhythms in culture (Michel et al., 1993; Welsh et al., 1995), and circadian oscillations (e.g., rhythmic clock gene expression) were found widespread throughout the periphery (Balsalobre et al., 1998; Plautz et al., 1997; Zylka et al., 1998). As such, a modern hierarchical view of circadian rhythms features a coordinating “pacemaker” rather than a vague, all-powerful “master,” and rightfully recognizes “slave” oscillators as autonomous “peripheral” oscillators.3 Nevertheless, more than a dozen articles using the outdated language are still published every year, and prospective circadian biology students continue to sit in lecture halls where the term is used. Given the prolific nature of these concepts, students may need to learn that peripheral oscillators used to be called “slave” oscillators, so they can comprehend older publications; however, we must encourage alternate terminologies be used (e.g., central/peripheral, primary/secondary, leader/follower), as these are not only less problematic, but more accurate. Altering the many articles and books already published using master-slave terminology would be a daunting, though not impossible, feat (All Together, Society of Women Engineers, 2020). More critical is that those in positions of authority modernize our field moving forward.

It complements the experiment and theory, and to the emerging the fourth pillar, the extraction of the new knowledge from the big data sets. The conference Computer simulations in Physics and beyond (CSP2020) are multidisciplinary meetings focusing on computational physics and related subjects. Indeed, computational physics methods prove useful in a broad spectrum of research in multiple natural sciences branches, and this volume provides a sample. The applications of machine learning in the natural sciences were presented at CSP2020 as well. This volume collects the refereed papers based on plenary, invited, and oral talks and the posters presented at the Fourth International Conference on Computer Simulations in Physics and beyond (CSP2020), which took place October 12-16, 2020 in Moscow. The CSP2020 conference continues the tradition started by an inaugural conference in 2015. It was jointly organized by the National Research University Higher School of Economics, the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, and Science Center in Chernogolovka. This year is unusual for the CSP conference due to the pandemic. We understood the difficulty for some participants to come to Moscow, taking into account the lockdowns around the world. Consequently, we change the usual format of the Conference: both plenary talks and parallel sessions will be afternoon due to the equilibration of the time zone differences around the globe. Parallel sessions include the contributed talks (20 min) and the poster talks (short online talks up to 10 min). We decided to add an epilogue to discuss the experience of shifting the conference online during a pandemic. The discussion particularly emphasizes the advantages and disadvantages of that move. We wrote the epilogue with the hope that our modest experience can be useful to other conference organizers. We hope that this volume will interest readers, and we are already looking forward to the next conference in the series.

The research was carried out with the participation of a total of 616 students, 314 boys and 302 girls, continuing their education in the fourth grade of primary school in a province located in the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey in the 2020-2021 academic year. The data of the research designed in the descriptive survey model were collected through the personal information form and the Inventory of Entrepreneurial Tendencies for Children. Since the data collection was carried out during the distance education process implemented due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the data collection tools were delivered to the students online and the students who volunteered to participate in the research were provided to fill in the scales. In the analysis of the data, descriptive statistics results and Mann Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis H tests were used. In addition, the effect size value was calculated for all the results obtained. A computer aided statistical program was used in the analysis. As a result of the research, it was determined that the entrepreneurship tendency of the students was at a high level. It has been determined that the entrepreneurship tendency of the students participating in the research differs significantly according to their pre-school education and following a science-themed children's magazine, the number of books they read in a month, the type of book they like to read, the profession they plan to do in the future and the socioeconomic level of the family. On the other hand, it was observed that the variables of gender and mother and father educational status did not have a significant effect on the entrepreneurship tendency of the fourth grade students in the sample of the study.",Gazi Journal of Education Sciences,2021.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.30855/gjes.2021.07.03.006', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30855/gjes.2021.07.03.006?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30855/gjes.2021.07.03.006, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9074eeff1e366f260093a07360a0f904d7b68fd3,"Searching for the Right Metaphors to Understand and Interrogate the
 AI Age","The invention of the printing press allowed the rapid dissemination of science, culture, and knowledge that many refer to as the Enlightenment, the Renaissance, or the Scientific Revolution (Dewar, 1998; Kissinger, Schmidt, & Huttenlocher, 2023). Many scholars and experts believe AI will be as transformative as the printing press and usher in unprecedented growth in knowledge and human potential (Ball, 2023; Kissinger et al., 2023; Sforza, 2023). Of course we can’t yet know whether AI will be as transformational as the printing press, but this comparison invoked by thought leaders reveals the human impulse to use metaphors to make sense of an unpredictable future. My sense is that we are entering a new era of knowledge production that will profoundly impact civilization. We see glimpses everywhere of the potential of AI. Business professionals are rapidly adopting these tools to create content and communicate. The major software vendors are integrating AI into personal productivity software. More than any other reason, I believe we are entering a new era because AI is now available for any person to use in novel ways. People need no technical skills. They can use natural language to engage AI applications to imagine and create. I’ll refer to this new era as the AI Age. Business communication scholars and instructors are uniquely positioned to provide guidance in the AI Age. The rapid adoption of AI tools in the past year is largely to support communication tasks, which I’ll refer to as AI-mediated communication (AI-MC) (Hancock, Naaman, & Levy, 2020). Business practitioners engage in the following AI-MC activities: researching ideas, drafting emails and reports, creating images for logos and business plans, creating social media posts, revising text in communications, and other similar applications. While business communication scholars have increasingly explored the impact of AI on business communication in the past five years (e.g., Getchell et al., 2022; Lee, 2020; Son, Lee, & Chang, 2019), this moment is unique: only in the past year have nearly all business professionals had easy access to generative AI. We are entering unchartered terrain. In early 2023, several colleagues and I surveyed around 340 business communication instructors about AI and writing instruction. Business communication instructors are uniquely qualified to evaluate how new technologies influence communication. Many experts and software vendors tend to emphasize the technical side of new technologies, whereas these instructors were able to identify the profound influences AI may have on human relationships, capabilities, and autonomy. Instructors in this project specifically commented on the challenges and opportunities associated with AI-assisted writing. They collectively suggested that AI literacy requires competencies in application, authenticity, accountability, and agency (Cardon, Fleischmann, Aritz, Logemann, & Heidewald, 2023a). Interestingly, business communication instructors in our study sought to make sense of generative AI in terms of metaphors. They referred to AI as similar to various tools, applications, and services, such as a calculator, Wikipedia, a computer, Received: Jul 10, 2023 Accepted: Jul 26, 2023 Corresponding author: Peter Cardon Department of Business Communication, Marshall School of Business University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA Tel: +1-213-740-0133, E-mail: cardon@marshall.usc.edu",Business Communication Research and Practice,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'http://www.e-bcrp.org/download/download_pdf?pid=bcrp-6-2-65', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22682/bcrp.2023.6.2.65?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22682/bcrp.2023.6.2.65, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a8ba087162dc14a3e6deedd3ae88b8fd92e8f266,In memory of Vladimir Evgen’evich Fortov,"renowned scientist and laureate of many prestigious prizes and honorary titles. He made a major contribution to the physics of extreme states of matter and high energy densities, nonideal plasmas, shock and detonation waves, thermophysics, chemical physics, space research, and electric power, as well as several other realms of physics and technology (including defense programs). Fortov was president of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) from 2013 to 2017, a full commander of the Order for Services to the Fatherland, a courageous citizen, and a man with an open heart. January 23, 2021 would have been his 75th birthday. It was not to be. Vladimir Evgen'evich passed away on November 29, 2020. Hismighty body, strong by nature, could not cope with consequences of COVID. And it seemed to all those who knew Vladimir Evgen'evich that no obstacle existed in the world that he could not surmount. Fortov was born in the town of Noginsk,MoscowRegion less than a year after the victory in the Great Patriotic War into the family of air force engineer-lieutenant colonel Evgenii Viktorovich and school teacher Galina Ivanovna Fortov. Inspired by heroic feats of their parents' generation, children in those times aspired to grandiose deeds. Vladimir's childhood and school years were spent near a military airfield (because of his father's profession), which could not but have influenced the course of his life. In 1962, on finishing school at age 16, he enrolled in the Department of Aerophysics and Space Research of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), where stars of Russian science were teaching and whom Vladimir Evgen'evich always remembered with deep respect and gratitude. While still a secondyear student, Vladimir began his research work in the primary department of the Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Processes (now the M V Keldysh State Research Center) under the supervision of VMIevlev, a correspondingmember of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1968, V E Fortov graduated from the institute with distinction in Thermodynamics and Aerodynamics and became a post-graduate student at the MIPT Department of Physical mechanics. In 1971, he defended his candidate thesis, entitled ``Thermophysics of Nuclear Rocket Engines'', ahead of schedule, and was to be sent to work in the far east. However, a fortuitous meeting with academician Ya B Zel'dovich, who had listened closely to V E Fortov's talk at a conference, radically changed the life of the young scientist: Yakov Borisovich put in a good word about him to the Nobel Prize winner N N Semenov. And so, in 1971, with Ya B Zel'dovich's magic touch, Fortov began working in the Chernogolovka Branch of the Institute of Chemical Physics of the USSR Academy of Sciences. There, he engaged in investigations in the field of nonideal plasma physics and extreme states of matter. The results underlay his doctoral thesis, ``Nonideal Plasma Investigations Using Dynamic Methods,'' which he defended in 1976, only five years after he started his research. This subject remained at the center of Fortov's attention his whole life. V E Fortov was deeply involved in studies of the mechanics of deformation and damage to materials at high pressures and temperatures, as well as at high deformation rates. Beginning in the 1980s, he supervised experimental and theoretical research into the mechanical properties of materials and damaging elements, barriers, and structures of special hardware. When in the early 1980s a team of scientists headed by academician R Z Sagdeev started implementing the Vega International Space Program aimed at studying Halley's comet, Fortov's experience, gained in the investigation of high-speed impact, came to be in great demand. The protection of the Vega spacecraft from meteorites and a system of dust impact analyzers successfully fulfilled their task, and the computer codes used then were later adapted for studying the problem of asteroid hazards.

c7a9f6bebd7f3fc57aef366980a19bec76cc99c4,Make them open and more about image cytometry,"As I write the June editorial, CYTO Interactive is taking place virtually. Compared with the CYTO 2020, virtual by necessity, I definitely found this year's format more attractive. Discussion forums, break out session and various “Lounges” created a feeling of being there and discussing in person. Even then, there is a general saturation of these exclusively remote meetings, and it is no surprise that people long to get back to normal at least partially. A real discussion with a real person is different. In that same vein, reflecting the real cytometry community, Cytometry A is looking to insert transparency in the editorial process, particularly as it pertains to the anonymity of peer-reviewers and peerreviews. To that effect, Cytometry Part A will implement an Open Peer Review process in the near future. Many journals have already adopted some form of open peer review. For Cytometry Part A, author and reviewer participation is voluntary, and they will be able to opt in or out. If they agree, then with the finally accepted paper will be amended by the reviewers' comments and (if selected) also by then name of the reviewer. This is an active step forward to facilitate open science and transparency to the readers and the authors. In this July issue I have compiled six manuscripts around the topic of image analysis for cytometric cell analysis, an area that has been already in the focus of several special issues of Cytometry Part A. Cytotoxicity assays are in the focus of the first two manuscripts in this line. Cytotoxicity tests are common all over the field of biomedicine, including drug development, cancer therapy, and beyond. Wu et al. (pp. 678–686) combined traditional flow cytometric cytotoxicity assay using CFSE and HOE 33258 with imaging cytometry in flow. The authors could improve the detection specificity of the assay and reduce incubation time to 15 s, enabling it for higher-throughput applications. Wang et al. (pp. 687–695) used image cytometry to improve, CAR-T cell production and quality. CAR-T cells are genetically engineered autologous T-cells with a chimeric antigen receptor. CAR cells are the tool and hope for otherwise incurable malignancies. By image cytometry transduction efficiency, cell proliferation and general and specific cell killing efficiency were tested. Image cytometry yielded comparable results to with standard flow cytometry and/or Cr release-assay but required substantially less cells and was therefore more efficient. Nuclear feature analysis from microscopic images involving artificial intelligence could support manual analysis of complex specimens and reduce error rate of manual analysis [1]. Lee et al. (pp. 696–704) were focusing their work on nuclear texture analysis in breast cancer cells in human tumors. Nuclear texture features are of relevance in diagnosis and grading of tumor cells. After cancer cell nuclei segmentation from images of H&E labeled tissues texture features were extracted by image analysis. Images were then classified using machine learning with support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor algorithms. For the trained algorithms the correct classification was highest when different nuclear features were combined and yielded over 90% accuracy. Woloshuk et al. (pp. 705–719) involved Deep Learning based on Convolutional Neural Network to classify three-dimensional (3D) segmented images of cell nuclei of the human kidney based on nuclear shape features. After confocal tissue imaging nuclei were segmented by tissue cytometry [2] and manually classified into eight different cell types by experts. After training the algorithm, accuracy of nucleus type prediction that was based exclusively on nuclear features was higher for 3D rendered nuclei than from two-dimensional (2D) images. Accuracy increased to over 80% if additional information on nuclear environment such as surrounding tissue was provided. Urine cell cytology for bladder cancer diagnosis is addressed by the two last papers in this selection. Both used computer-based visioning, recognition, and classification of normal and malignant cells in the human urine. Lv et al. (pp. 720–729) developed a microfluidic chip system where urine cells are microencapsulated in oil droplets and imaged. This is followed by automated image segmentation. The results demonstrate that oil encapsulation is superior to other preparation techniques for reliable cell recognition and classification. Awan et al. (pp. 730–740) used datasets from cytological images of patients. The cells were classified by expert observers and then used as training or test data using two deep learning approaches. Following cell identification and segmentation the power of discrimination by the trained classifiers displayed ROC values above 0.8. In conclusion, combination flow cytometry with image cytometry and bioinformatics is promising for automating and improving diagnosis. Still further clinical studies are needed to prove their value in the real world.",Cytometry Part A,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/cyto.a.24476', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/cyto.a.24476?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/cyto.a.24476, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The CMDM 2020 workshop brought together researchers, postgraduate students and academics interested in computer and mathematical modelling in decision making in different areas. The CMDM 2020 workshop’s main topics were computer and mathematical modeling for decision support in solving problems arising in industry, engineering, finance, insurance, as well as decision support methods and tools for data analysis, machine learning, forecasting, analytics, and their applications. The workshop was co-organized by Saratov State University (Saratov, Russia), the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Department of Statistics and Data Analysis of Higher School of Economics (Moscow, Russia). The CMDM 2020 workshop was held online due to the pandemic of COVID-19 and was co-located with the IX International Research and Practice Conference on Mathematical and Computer Modelling in Economics, Insurance and Risk Management, Saratov, Russia, November 25-28, 2020. The virtual format of the workshop was a first and novel attempt in this difficult year, but we are very satisfied that we have made it a success. Thirty two papers were submitted and twelve papers were accepted for presentation at the workshop after a careful peer reviewing process with discussions among reviewers and members of the program committee. All papers published in this volume of Journal of Physics: Conference Series have been peer reviewed through processes administered by the Editors. Reviews were conducted by expert referees to the professional and scientific standards expected of a proceedings journal published by IOP Publishing.

38dd699326deb6205a8f229b9c4246d15936eb0c,Zooming in on Open Access in Ukraine,"In October 2022, Ukraine declared its commitment to enhancing the effectiveness, quality and responsiveness of its research by implementing the National Plan for Open Science (Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, 2022). This document represents a significant step forward in aligning Ukraine's national legislation with European Union requirements and promoting the adoption of open science practices. Open access (OA) is a crucial component of open science, and it is imperative to gain insight into its growth to inform funding policies and plan infrastructure development accordingly.The aim of this research is to obtain a comprehensive overview of the OA development in Ukraine. To achieve this goal, publications affiliated with Ukrainian research institutions and universities in the period from 2012 to 2021 were collected from three well-known databases: Dimensions, Web of Science, and Scopus. Records were gathered in November 2022 using the web interfaces of WoS and Scopus, while data from Dimensions was extracted via the Dimensions API. After excluding duplicates and publications without DOIs, the OA status of each publication was determined using the Unpaywall API.
The study revealed that between 2012 and 2021, authors affiliated with Ukrainian research institutions and universities published 201,670 research papers. Of these publications, 66.7% were open access, while the remaining 33.3% were behind a paywall. The percentage of OA articles for the indicated 10-year period increased substantially from 33.8% in 2012 to 79.9% in 2021.Gold open access was the most common OA subtype, with 68.4% of articles published in OA journals. The second most frequent choice was bronze open access, accounting for 15.3% of articles. Green subtype and hybrid were less commonly used, with 8.5% and 7.8% of articles published in these categories, respectively.Regarding the distribution of open access across different academic disciplines, the highest percentage of OA publications was found in the social sciences, with a rate of 88.1%, followed closely by the humanities at 87.8%, and medical and health sciences at 73.4%. Agriculture sciences, multidisciplinary studies, and natural sciences also exhibited relatively high levels of OA publications, representing 71.7%, 63.4%, and 55.7%, respectively. The lowest proportion of OA publications was observed in the engineering and technology category, with a rate of 47.7%.This empirical study indicates that the share of OA publications in Ukraine is significantly higher than the global average of 31% reported by Piwowar, Priem, and Orr in 2019 and their estimation of 44% by 2025 (Piwowar et al., 2019). Notably, Ukraine is approaching the indicators of European ""openness"" leaders, such as Great Britain, Sweden, Austria, and the Netherlands (Robinson-Garcia et al., 2020). It is worth mentioning that northern and central European countries have been early adopters of open access policies (Maddi et al., 2021), while Ukraine lacks mandates for research dissemination through OA, transformative agreements and only a few institutions have registered their OA policy with ROARMAP. The high share of OA publications in Ukraine can be partially attributed to the longstanding tradition of national journals being open access and fully subsidized by hosting research institutions. Therefore, open access has always been a part of the research dissemination culture in Ukraine (Novikov, 2020).",PUBMET - Conference Scholarly Publishing Context Open Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://morepress.unizd.hr/journals/index.php/pubmet/article/download/4255/4987', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15291/pubmet.4255?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15291/pubmet.4255, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0600b3e2f75b29c9d3c82d5d817dcd086d5e55a1,"The future of dementia care, caregiving, and services research","With the aging of the baby boomers, the numbers of Americans living with or affected by dementia will rise dramatically. By 2025, an estimated 7.2 million Americans are expected to have Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60– 80% of cases. In the absence of medical breakthroughs, the prevalence is expected to climb to 13.8 million by 2060, almost doubling the number currently affected. To prepare for this coming crisis, the National Alzheimer's Project Act was signed into law in January 2011 followed by the 2012 release of a National Plan to address Alzheimer's disease that includes five goals to: prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease and related dementias by 2025, enhance care quality and efficiency, expand supports for people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their families, enhance public awareness and engagement, and improve data to track progress. As part of the federal effort to accomplish these goals, additional funds have been directed to the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to support Alzheimer's research, rising from $986 million in fiscal year 2016 to $2.398 billion in fiscal year 2019. With this increased funding, since 2016, the NIA has utilized a higher pay line for Alzheimer's Disease/Alzheimer's Disease-Related Disorders (AD/ADRD) investigatorinitiated research. As part of NIA's effort, a series of Summits has been held on Alzheimer's Disease (2012, 2015, 2018) and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (2013, 2016, 2019). In 2017, sponsored by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and private sector organizations, the first National Research Summit on Dementia Care, Caregiving, and Services was held. These Summits have resulted in the identification of AD +ADRD Implementation Milestones that guide funding opportunities and priorities. In particular, the first Summit brought attention to the importance of dementia care, identifying 464 recommendations within 12 categories, which have resulted in 26 funding opportunities, 4 Notices of Special Interest, and 129 new NIA care-related awards. An interdisciplinary Consortium to Improve Care and Outcomes for Persons Living with Alzheimer's and Dementia and the NIA Imbedded Pragmatic Alzheimer's Disease and AD-Related Dementia Clinical Trials (IMPACT) Collaboratory have been funded. Building on this momentum, planning for the second Dementia Care, Caregiving, and Services Summit, sponsored by the NIA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Education (ASPE), US Department of Health and Human Services, began in March 2019. Guided by a 19-member Steering Committee, preparation followed a deliberate process of information gathering from the public and stakeholders, including ASPE, which obtained input from five Stakeholder Groups (persons living with dementia, family caregivers, service providers, workforce developers, and payers). The Summit was organized around six Themes plus one integrated Theme and an Emerging Topics session (Table 1). Each Theme's Summit session included research presentations that provided scientific background followed by introduction of draft research “Gaps and Opportunities” to advance the science within the Theme. Sessions concluded with reactions from diverse panelists and questions from the audience. The Summit was to be held in-person on March 24 and 25, 2020 but due to COVID-19, was converted to three virtual sessions held on July 10, July 21, and August 13, 2020. Recordings of the Summit sessions, including a virtual poster session can be viewed at https://www.nia. nih.gov/2020-dementia-care-summit. After the Summit concluded, draft Goals and Opportunities were revised based on feedback and further discussion among the Steering Committee to create a final set https://www.nia. nih.gov/research/summit-gaps-opportunities. A final report describing the process and agendas for the sessions and containing the Gaps and Opportunities has been posted https://www.nia.nih.gov/sites/default/files/ 2021-01/DementiaCareSummitReport.pdf.

3f33fcb051f367a4854753299bd9b6ba72578e4c,Hispanic Computer Brigade Silicon Valley Computer Camp,"Hispanic students are vastly underrepresented in computing during a time when the Hispanic population in the U.S. is growing dramatically. By 2020, Hispanics will account for 50% of the workers in California. And, by 2050, the Hispanic population is projected to triple in the United States with 25% of the U.S. population being of Hispanic origin. The College of Engineering (CoE) at San José State University proposed a new approach for recruiting Hispanic students into computing disciplines and careers through the Hispanic Computer Brigade (HCB) initiative. By forming HCBs in two local high schools, we aimed to inspire and engage Hispanic students through IT service learning projects. The high school students began the program with a summer camp, continued to learn and engage computing throughout the year with community service learning, and will end with a local competition where students will showcase their computing projects with high school faculty, SJSU faculty, parents/guardians, and the community. Students are learning computer and programming skills and processes in weekly meetings with the help of advisors and mentors. To support the Hispanic Computer Brigade initiative, the CoE received support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for a one-year pilot program for Hispanic students from the San Jose East Side Union High School District. The first segment of the HCB program was the Silicon Valley Computer Camp (SVCC).

404eae7a76e457de393edef85d89e57babcd0a69,Program Chairs Message,"It is with great pleasure that we present the proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR) 2020 conference papers track. This is the third year that the conference has featured an expanded conference papers track, integrating what used to be known as the IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces. We are proud to report that this year’s program continues the momentum established last year, with an even broader range of paper topics spanning virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, human-computer interaction, mobile computing, computer graphics, cognitive and perceptual psychology, games, education, and the social sciences. This exciting research reflects the current interest in VR and 3DUI technologies; never before has VR/3DUI technology been so widely accessible and has the new research and technologies presented at our conference been so immediately applicable. The conference papers program received a record number of submissions this year. The VR Conference Paper track received a total of 486 complete submissions in all areas of VR and 3DUI. These are roughly 10% more submissions in comparison to last year. To manage such a large number of submissions required a similarly large Program Committee, consisting of 90 world-leading experts from around the globe, and from all areas of VR/AR/MR and 3D User Interfaces. It is an understatement to say that the review process would not have been possible without the efforts of these people, and we wholeheartedly thank them for their contributions to the community in reviewing a large load of submissions on a tight timeline. Due to the challenges of this continual growth in submissions, we replicated the paper review process introduced in 2019. We additionally increased the number of conference paper chairs to seven. Paper reviewing was again performed within “topic areas” (TAs), similar to the sub-committee model used by some other conferences with high numbers of submissions. We used three broad clusters of research topics and assigned each of the 90 members of the International Program Committee we recruited to one of the TAs. Authors were asked to specify a primary and secondary preference for the TAs that best fit their paper. Two Conference Paper Chairs were assigned to lead each TA and conducted regular charing tasks. Unlike other sub-committee models, all Conference Paper Chairs met bi-weekly as a large group and shared the progress of each TA, discussing any issues that arose during the review process, and prioritizing the goal of maintaining consistency in the review process across the TAs. In this way, we viewed the continuation of TAs in this year’s process as a practical way to facilitate matching the most appropriate reviewers with papers and split the reviewing tasks into more manageable pools of around 160 papers, while also keeping with our tradition of accepting the best work to the conference regardless of topic (we were careful not to impose a quota or limit for the number of papers accepted from each TA). This is the second year we have used a sub-committee-based model, and we look forward to a continued discussion with all of you about ideas for evolving our reviewing model in the future. In a bit more detail, the review process proceeded as follows: after an initial check by the Conference Paper chairs and/or submission coordinator, several submissions were desk rejected without review due to not being anonymized or of incorrect submission length. All remaining submissions received at least three full reviews: one review from a member of the International Program Committee (single-blind review), and two from external reviewers chosen as experts from the broader research community (double-blind review). For each submission, the submission coordinator was in charge of starting and moderating a discussion among the reviewers, and providing a meta-review and an initial accept/reject recommendation following the outcome of the discussion. Four recommendations were possible at this stage: (1) accept as conference paper, (2) conditionally accept as conference paper, (3) conditionally accept as poster abstract, or (4) reject. In the case of a difficult decision, the Conference Paper Chairs recruited an additional reviewer from the International Program Committee (single-blind review). The Program Chairs for each TA met separately to discuss the recommendations for each paper with an emphasis on maintaining consistency in the recommendations from the coordinators. Then, all the Conference Paper Chairs met in a final meeting in order to validate the decisions coming from each sub-committee meeting and to discuss the papers still missing a final recommendation. This selection process resulted in a program consisting of 104 papers, corresponding to an overall acceptance rate of 21.4%. The program covers a wide number of topics ranging from novel stereoscopic rendering methods, to haptic and sound rendering, virtual avatars, navigation, social presence, visualization, virtual training, human perception, and many equally exciting topics. All of the conference papers will be presented at IEEE VR 2020, alongside TVCG journal papers in thematically organized sessions. In addition, from the 172 submissions conditionally accepted as 2-pages poster abstracts, 74 final poster submissions were accepted. Please note that the VR community provides guidance to paper reviewers that a previously published poster abstract does not subtract from the novelty of a submitted paper.",IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications,2019.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/8930311/8935004/08935054.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/nca.2019.8935054?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/nca.2019.8935054, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7c3aeadce43e95706d902cd3d474e2c5c418e8ff,"Focus on technology: surgical selfies, ransomware attacks, AI-assisted mental health care","CMAJ | January 10, 2022 | Volume 194 | Issue 1 E23 R ecent research suggests that remotely monitoring patients recovering at home from surgery or COVID-19 may improve some outcomes and ease pressure on health systems — although governments and physicians are still grappling with how to balance virtual care and in-person services. One randomized controlled trial in npj Digital Medicine found that monitoring wound healing after surgery via a smartphone tool and “selfie” snapshots of the incision nearly quadrupled the odds of diagnosing surgical site infections within a week after the procedure compared to routine follow-up at 30 days. The study involved 492 people who underwent emergency abdominal surgery between July 2016 and March 2020. Researchers randomly assigned half of the participants to use the smartphone tool to complete questionnaires about their wounds and, if they were experiencing any symptoms of infection, send photos to their surgical team. Rates of surgical site infections and average time to diagnosis were roughly the same in both the smartphone group and those receiving routine care. However, researchers found that patients in the smartphone group were 3.7 times more likely to have an infection diagnosed within a week after their operation. They were also less likely to visit family doctors or other community care providers in the month after their procedure and reported more positive experiences accessing care. According to the authors, the study wasn’t big enough to parse the impact of remote monitoring on the time it took to diagnose infections, but their findings suggest that remote wound care is safe, feasible, and effective. A larger Canadian study conducted during the pandemic linked remote monitoring after surgery with decreased pain and increased detection and correction of medication errors. The randomized controlled trial published in The BMJ followed 905 patients for 30 days after nonelective surgery. Half the participants received remote monitoring devices, including a tablet computer, to measure their vital signs, share photos of their wounds and connect virtually with nurses. The other half received standard care — that is, they were instructed to check in with their doctor in a month or sooner if any issues came up. Researchers found no difference between the groups in “days alive at home,” the study’s main outcome. But more patients in the remote monitoring arm had a drug error detected (29.7% v. 5.5% in the standard care group) and corrected (28.4% v. 4%) — especially errors related to patients not taking their medications. The remote monitoring group was also less likely to report pain at seven, 15 and 30 days, or to require acute care or visit the emergency department. According to Dr. Philip Devereaux, a cardiologist and perioperative care physician at Hamilton Health Sciences involved with the study, checking in with patients regularly meant their concerns could be addressed quickly — often with simple interventions such as recommending acetaminophen to reduce pain. Reducing readmissions and emergency department visits decreased costs and strain on hospital services as well, he told CBC News. A nonrandomized remote monitoring study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that Americans recovering at home from COVID-19 who received twice-daily texts to check in about their symptoms were less likely to die than patients receiving standard care. A 24/7 team of telemedicine clinicians followed up with patients who reported worsening symptoms in response to the automated texts. At 30 days, there were 1.8 fewer deaths per 1000 patients among the 3488 people enrolled in the remote monitoring service than among the 4377 who received standard care. At 60 days, there were 2.5 fewer deaths per 1000 people in the remote monitoring group. The study authors attributed the difference to remote monitoring patients having more frequent contact with telemedicine and visiting the hospital more frequently and sooner than others recovering at home. However, some clinicians and patients remain apprehensive of the broader shift to virtual care during the pandemic. One survey of 1500 rheumatology patients and clinicians conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge earlier this year found more than four in five rated remote medicine as worse than face-to-face consultations, even though most said virtual care was more convenient.

7e63994054ba96c042ed3617e914be85a3daac2c,Foreword to the Applied Data Science: Invited Talks Track at KDD-2017,"The Applied Data Science (ADS) Invited Talks Track at KDD-2017 is a continuation of what has now become a ""7-year tradition"" at KDD conferences. This is the second year the track operates under the ADS name, an evolution from its origins at KDD-2011 as the ""Industry Practice Expo"". The KDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) is the world's first, largest and best conference on Data Science, Data Mining, and Knowledge Discovery. It brings together a healthy mix of academic researchers, industry and government researchers, and practitioners from a wide range of institutions and fields. The primary focus on KDD is on peer-reviewed research contributions and the academic advancement of the field. This is an important goal and in fact the KDD conference is now recognized as the most competitive and prestigious forum for presenting high quality research results. KDD, being fundamentally an applied field, needs the strong representation of applied work of big impact. Over the years of running the conference we observed that our initial speaker-selection approach needed to be re-thought because of the important contributions made to the field outside traditional academic, industrial and government research laboratories. The result of this re-thinking was to create a forum that exposes important contributions to Data Science through Big Data Applications that address strategic problems. We wanted to effectively capture the rising importance of Data Science and Machine Learning especially in the Big Data environment where structured and unstructured data create special challenges, and of course present new opportunities. The goal of the Invited Talks Track is to curate contributions from leaders in our field who have made important contributions through the development of a system, the creation of a new and important business, or the development and market introduction of a product,. Some of these important contributions may never see an academic paper or detailed peer-reviewed paper written about them, yet they are of critical importance to our very applied field. To give you an idea of how rapidly growing this area is, and how this sector of our industry and promises to be highly disruptive across many industries, we cite a couple of articles out of a plethora of such coverage: According to IDC, the global revenues from Big Data and business will grow from $130.1 billion in 2016 to more than $203 billion in 2020, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.7% [1]. Furthermore, to quote from a Forbes article: ""Data monetization"" will become a major source of revenues, as the world will create 180 zettabytes of data (or 180 trillion gigabytes) in 2025, up from less than 10 zettabytes in 2015.?

In either case, “Good Design” comes about through inter-disciplinary Design Innovation, and comprises the integration of people, process, methods, and principles (Camburn, et al., 2017; Tushar, et al., 2020; Sng, et al., 2017) [2-9]. Products, services, systems, or a combination are the result of good design, creating a transformative design impact on community, society, and people’s lives. Design impact can take several forms. Some of these may be quantitative, such as an increase in economic value after a rebranding campaign, improved sustainability, or a greater employee satisfaction after re-designing a workspace. Other forms of impact may be qualitative, such as increased positive sentiments, judgements in ethical sensitivities, and sense of well-being. In the end, Good Design emerges from the designers’ wellarticulated ethos, and creates a “Wow” through its impact. Taking our understanding and application of Design Impact to the next level, we worked with Singapore and the DesignSingapore (Dsg) Council [10] to explore, define and test design impact evaluation strategies as part of Singapore’s most prestigious national design award program, the President’s Design Award (P*DA; https://www.designsingapore.org/presidents-design-award) [11]. Through interviews with expert designers, a careful study of the design disciplines, and an understanding of design award programs across the world, the concept of a Design Impact framework was developed. This framework, as a unification of the concept of Design Impact across disciplines and scales, places emphasis on outcome-based design impact alongside recognition of excellence in design craftsmanship. Designers who bring together diverse skills and work collaboratively across disciplines to address complex issues are given significant recognition. This approach celebrates future-forward designs, designers and design processes that anticipate, envision and shape the world of tomorrow. 1 Sponsored by the DesignSingapore (Dsg) Council, as part of the President’s Design Award (P*DA). SUTD-MIT International Design Center (IDC) served as the official Knowledge Partner for the P*DA program. 2 SUTD-MIT International Design Center (IDC), Design Innovation (DI) Program, Singapore University of Technology and Design 3 Comcast Media and Technology Center (CMTC), College of Engineering, Design, and Computing, University of Colorado Denver 4 DesignSingapore (Dsg) Council, Singapore 5 McKinsey and Company, Singapore ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conference, Design Theory and Methodology (DTM) Conference, Presentation and Extended Abstract, 52944, August 2020. 2 As a tangible and extended idea of Design Impact, four Impact Areas were identified to constitute the framework, initially tested and utilized as part of the P*DA (Fig. 1): A. Enabling Economic Transformation B. Raising Quality of Life C. Advancing Brand, Culture and Community at Any Scale D. Making Ground-breaking Achievements in Design Figure 1. Design Impact Framework: Design Impact Areas (4), Outcomes (13), and DemonstratorsMetrics (57). Outcomes and demonstrators were developed to help define and assess each impact area. Examples include enhancing employee experience, enhancing living experience, empowering and facilitating positive user learning, increasing revenue, simplifying usage and increasing efficiency & effectiveness, increasing identity and bonds with community, and innovating processes and functionality. People are at the center of this understanding of Design Impact, and it is supported by a repeatable process to assess design impact across industry and government sectors. Using the Design Impact framework, we hypothesized that we may answer questions such as, “What could a hotel, a toolkit for non-profit organizations, and one of the largest 3D-printed structures have in common?” They are all examples of impactful designs, beautifully conceptualized and executed. The Design Impact framework considers different types of impact and shows that while certain types of “impact” can be quantified, we also now have other ways for measuring impact and widening its definition. To test the developed Design Impact framework, a submission portal was developed, through the DesignSingapore Council’s website, for designers and organizations, across disciplines and across project scales, to submit their designs as part of the Singapore President’s Design Award. Over a three-year ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conference, Design Theory and Methodology (DTM) Conference, Presentation and Extended Abstract, 52944, August 2020. 3 period, and across two cycles of submissions for the P*DA, hundreds of designs were submitted and juries of design experts shortlisted the submissions [12]. We then assessed the shortlisted designs using our developed Design Impact framework and assessment methodology, and reported Design Impact results back to the juries. Through these engagements, data were collected on all design submissions; coverage of the impact areas, outcomes and demonstrators; the level of impact of the submitted designs; and survey results of the members of the national award juries. These data were then analyzed across multiple factors, resulting in a number of insights about Design Impact and conclusions concerning the Design Impact framework. Overall, these insights and conclusions include: the Design Impact framework was effective and comprehensive in representing, understanding and measuring design impact; the Design Impact framework provided a basis and common language for discussing designs across disciplines and scale; and there is value in representing Design Impact for not only assessing designs, but for proactively planning impact in future designs. We believe that being able to do so will enable companies and designers to forecast project outcomes and drive teams more effectively. In this presentation, we motivate the need to investigate the area of Design Impact and develop a deeper understanding, representation, and method for measuring impact, across disciplines and scale. We then present our Design Impact framework and assessment methodology, along with our research methodology, data collection approach, results, analyses, and conclusions. Figure 2 provides exemplar research findings. Today design is at our fingertips, for all of us, for our organizations, and for our communities. We all can invest in learning and extending our skill sets in designerly ways. We can apply design and gaze through the lens of what constitutes good design and even design excellence, as we strive to make our lives and our world better. And ultimately we can know and embrace the unknowable – Design Impact, applying it in all facets of our government, business and private lives. This is our challenge as a world community; let’s proceed forth and realize it every moment of every day. In the words of Dr Jeffrey Chan (2018), “Today, design is increasingly harnessed in the creation of new environments within already existing artificial environments and systems. In doing this, humanity has evolved from being merely a biological actor to a geological agent – one that is equipped with an agency for creating successive layers of new design, which are rapidly accreting on prior layers of already existing artificial systems. Consequentially in the Anthroprocene, the focus has also shifted from the protection of the environment to the production of environments. And it is [through] the power of design that the Anthroprocene can be properly understood.” ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conference, Design Theory and Methodology (DTM) Conference, Presentation and Extended Abstract, 52944, August 2020. 4 Figure 2.

626ac6a4038546d5565c18f0f80048c4fbecf8d9,Reflections on Cancer/Healthcare Landscape in India on the Occasion of 75 Years of Independence: Glorious Past and a Future Filled with Pride and Optimism,"For most of the past two millennia, Bharat (India, as we know now) was an economic powerhouse with the highest GDP in the world [1, 2]. From year 1 AD to almost 1500 AD, Bharat’s GDP was the highest in the world by a large measure and accounted for almost one-third of all global trade (Fig. 1). In parallel with its economic prowess, Bharat then and before was also a major contributor to the field of medical sciences [3–5]. Researchers have noted that almost 9000 years ago, prehistoric dentists in Baluchistan used drills on the teeth of a living person to cure toothache [6]. The golden age of medicine in Bharat from 800 BC to 1000 AD was also known to have produced many important treatises such as the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita [5]. The Sushruta Samhita discusses many aspects of anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, diagnostic medicine, pediatrics, geriatrics and obstetrics, and gynecology in 120 chapters spread out over 5 sections [7]. The Sushruta Samhita may be one of the earliest treatises to describe surgery/surgical procedures in an organized fashion with detailed drawings. He also described simulation (which is now considered an integral part of medical education almost 2400 years later) by performing mock operations on watermelons and clay pots. More importantly, he may have developed a code of ethics for teachers and students long before the Hippocratic oath that we all are familiar with. In addition, surgical instruments made of copper were also recovered from Takshashila [8]. Several instruments made of pure copper are displayed in the Takshashila museum which include decapitators and spatulae [8]. Successive waves of ruthless invaders and colonization over the past approximately 1400 years contracted Bharat/ India’s GDP to its lowest level around the time of independence [1, 2]. It is noted by some that close to $ 45 trillion and a yet to be determined amount of wealth was taken out of India during the recent colonial rule and prior invasions, respctively [9, 10]. Around the time of independence, India’s GDP accounted for less than 3% of the world’s GDP [11]. Without attributing causality, it is likely that the economic decline of Bharat may have also led to a decrease in its contributions to the field of medical sciences. Since independence, India’s GDP has started to rise again. Not surprisingly, the pace of rise in GDP was tardy for the first few decades after independence [12]. From a GDP of $ 30.6 billion in 1950, India’s GDP in 2020 stood at $ 2.6 trillion and is predicted to rise to $ 5 trillion by the year 2025 [12]. This reverse parabolic trend in India’s economy is a testament to its resilience despite many tribulations that were tragic and ghastly by any definition. Horrific events of epochal proportions such as the partition, famines, geopolitical instability, and wars with neighbors notwithstanding, India’s economy is poised to become the third largest in the world [13]. Without again attributing causality, it is likely that resurgence of economic might have contributed to improvement in many domains of life in India. The average life span in India increased from 33.94 years in 1950 to 69.27 years in 2020 [12]. Literacy rates for both genders increased from 18.3% in 1951 to 74.4% in 2018 [14]. Despite the gap between genders, literacy rates for females increased from less than 15% in 1951 to 65.8% in 2018, and girls have outnumbered boys in school education [14]. In addition to an increase in the life span, we have witnessed a change in the leading causes of death in India. The leading causes of death in India now are not only due to communicable diseases and maternal/neonatal mortality, but also include non-communicable diseases [15]. Ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and stroke are some of the leading causes of death in India [15]. * Chandrakanth Are care@unmc.edu",Indian Journal of Surgical Oncology,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13193-022-01662-z.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9532231, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Technology undoubtedly facilitates human life when used properly. There are many benefits to using technology in education.Technology today makes people's lives easier and progresses rapidly with it. In the process of integration of developing technologies into the field of education, important studies are carried out on the international platform. In the 21st century world, as well as changes in every field, various innovations in science and technology have occurred. Education plays an important role in keeping up with the requirements of the present era. Technological innovations and developments affect the education system and teaching learning-process in this context. The technologies used in education are leaving their place to new technologies. Increasingly, they take their place in the classroom environment such as computer, projection, electronic board, distance education and the learning environment is moved to the network environment (Bulman & Fairlie, 2016; Sendurur & Arslan, 2017). Lectures can be strengthened with technological equipment. On the other hand, using technology in education makes lessons more attractive for students. At the same time, supporting narration with technological tools facilitates learning and increases retention. For this reason, the use and importance of technology in education has increased today and teachers' attitudes towards technology use are important. When evaluated from this point of view, it is thought that the research subject will contribute to the literature. This study aimed to determine primary school teacher candidates' attitudes towards digital technology. In this study, the primary teacher candidates studying at a private university in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) were examined on the technology attitudes of teachers in education. The study was conducted with the participation of 121 teacher candidates during 2019-2020 academic year.

4424a1f6417cef8daf8d2c46569c65bb8f3284e4,Wildfire Significance within the San Francisco Bay Area’s Air Quality,"Due to the increase in frequency and severity of wildfires in the San Francisco Bay Area, wildfire smoke has become a significant public health hazard linked with lung morbidity and increased mortality in exposed populations. Wildfire smoke consists of many types of particles, each with its own set of adverse effects. This study focuses on particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns, or PM 2.5, one of the main contributors to adverse health effects, especially to the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems. In particular, we examine trends in 21 years of publicly available data from the Environmental Protection Agency on PM 2.5 air pollution by county by comparing PM 2.5 levels in the wildfire season months (May through October) to the rest of the year. Upon initial review, our findings may seem counterintuitive; on the three examined features of the dataset (mean, median, and maximum), the non-wildfire season generally yielded higher concentrations of mean and maximum PM 2.5 than the wildfire season. However, over time, the gap between the seasons has shrunk, which we propose is partially due to the PM 2.5 maximums driven by recent wildfires. Although the historic gap of PM 2.5 levels between wildfire and non-wildfire should be explored, the acute maximums offer a compelling climate and public health threat to the San Francisco Bay Area region as a whole. Given the severe public health consequences of exposure to PM 2.5 and wildfire smoke, we urge policy makers to take additional preventative and mitigative action during and in preparation for annual wildfire seasons.

The western United States has seen consistent and rapid increases in wildfire activity since the 1980s, characterized by a rise in the frequency, severity, size, and total burned area associated with wildfires. California recognizes emerging wildfires as one of the significant threats to be expected under climate change;1 aggregate fire indices have risen by 20% following temperature increases and precipitation decreases in autumn over the last four decades.2 California wildfires from the last five years (Carr, Camp, Lightning Complex, and Dixie) highlight the necessity of wildfire prevention and mitigation. Wildfire smoke, in particular, has been a public health risk for vulnerable populations and is projected to become increasingly severe amidst high emissions climate change scenarios.3 Smoke is notoriously difficult to measure and model, and data on it is scarce, relatively recent, and often incomplete. By studying levels of particulate matter (PM), a metric tracked by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) since the 1990s, we can draw some relevant conclusions from the incomplete picture the data provides. In particular, we focused our study on the levels of particulate matter that is sized about 2.5 micrometers (PM 2.5) or smaller as those are some of the most harmful forms of pollution from the wildfires that can be tracked. PM can be sourced from multiple pollutants, however, as one of the primary particles of wildfire smoke, particulate matter is widely used to measure levels of smoke during wildfire events.4,5 Additionally, since PM 2.5 is a particularly hazardous form of air pollution to human health, monitoring its levels is a valuable metric. LITERATURE REVIEW Altogether, the consequences of climate change continue to worsen wildfire conditions yearly. Impacts such as alterations to precipitation cycles, increased drought, and more frequent extreme heat events all contribute to more favorable conditions for extreme wildfire events. Recent climate studies indicate that precipitation within California will increasingly fall as rain rather than snow in shorter, but heavier, storm events later into autumn.6 This delayed wet season exacerbates wildfire risk as September, October, and November (typically the wettest) are drier, thereby extending the wildfire season before the shorter rain season begins. Furthermore, research suggests that wildfires can reburn similar areas quicker when drought conditions have been active within the region, although this relationship needs to be explored further in fire prone areas, such as chaparral.7 Wildfire smoke is composed of many hazardous pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter (PM).8 The exact health effects of smoke, particularly associated with long term exposure, are difficult to measure and have become an active area of research today. However, there are clear dangers in regard to lung function and mortality. Within the Amazon, exposure to high levels of PM 2.5 from biomass burning was associated with reductions in lung function among school children.9 In Russia, wildfire smoke exposure in association with a 44-day long heat wave was expected to have caused 2000 more deaths than otherwise projected.10 A 13-year study on bushfire and dust exposure in Sydney, Australia yielded similar results on the heightened dangers of wildfire mortality during and the day after extreme heat events.11 RESEARCH FALL 2021 | Berkeley Scientific Journal 85 These studies highlight a growing link between the threat of smoke exposure and extreme heat, a critical intersection between climate threats as both are expected to increase in frequency under climate change. In recent years, wildfires are estimated to make up half of PM 2.5 emissions in the Western United States and about a quarter nationwide.12 Other primary sources of PM 2.5 include vehicle emissions, secondary sulfate, biomass combustion, and secondary organic aerosol (SOA).13 Historically, PM is associated with high mortality: in the London air pollution episode of 1952, 3000-4000 deaths were attributed to the dramatic levels of PM.14 PM 2.5 is dangerous for vulnerable populations, particularly the elderly, infants, persons with chronic cardiopulmonary disease, influenza or asthma,15 and increases in PM 2.5 lead to higher rates of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and inpatient spending.16 This study also estimates that 1 microgram per cubic meter in PM 2.5 exposure for one day causes 0.69 additional deaths per million elderly, and that a 1 μg·m-3 increase over 3 days in PM 2.5 is expected to cause a loss of about 3 life-years per million beneficiaries. To put these numbers in context, wildfires often surpass 35 μg·m-3 (safe level of AQI) and have the potential to reach levels greater than 250 μg·m-3 (hazardous level of AQI).17 One study found that, since the mid 1900s, PM levels have been decreasing by an average of 0.66 ± 0.10 μg·m-3 per year around the United States likely due to more stringent environmental regulation. The exception to this trend was in the Pacific Northwest seeing the highest increase in Sawtooth National Forest of an increase of 0.97 ± 0.22 μg·m-3 per year. The authors concluded that it was due to an increased wildfire occurrence in the Rocky Mountains.18 This study indicated that wildfires have a significant effect on the long term air quality of a region, although it highlights that a regional analysis is necessary to find accurate results. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District released a comprehensive report about the effect PM has on public health in November 2012, and it provides a strong public health framework for our wildfire discussion. Among other air pollutants, PM was only recognized as a severe public health threat beginning in the mid-1990s due to a series of compelling health studies regarding exposure. METHODS We focused our study on the levels of PM 2.5, or particulate matter that is sized about 2.5 micrometers or smaller, as it is one of the most harmful forms of pollution we can track that is directly related to wildfire smoke. Our objective for this study was to chart the relationship of PM 2.5 levels to wildfire activity within the San Francisco Bay Area using all of the available data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. We tracked nine different counties that constitute the San Francisco Bay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma to determine if trends we gathered are consistent across this region. We aimed to determine how PM 2.5 levels have changed since 1990, especially in regard to recent wildfires. Our data was collected from the United States Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System (AQS). We analyzed daily PM 2.5 AQI values from 1999-2020 for each of the nine San Francisco Bay Area counties. We focused our attention on PM 2.5 to measure the persistence of wildfire smoke, as wildfire smoke is one of the major contributors to PM 2.5 levels in the United States. Furthermore, to analyze trends between wildfires and AQI values, we split each year into two categories: wildfire season (May 1st to October 31st) and non-wildfire season (November 1st to April 30th). We arrived at the reasoning behind this set of dates by referencing a similar study which analyzed wildfire-specific particular matter, using these dates to distinguish wildfire season from non-wildfire season. 19 In order to interpret the data, we plotted the mean, median, and maximum PM 2.5 AQI value trends using linear regressions during the wildfire season and non-wildfire season for each San Francisco Bay Area county.

c6acfc8461b7de0e1eafa54e2e97a0d6baff41b6,AC 2009-2157: FACILITATING LIFELONG LEARNING SKILLS THROUGH A FIRST-YEAR ENGINEERING CURRICULUM,"Engineering accreditation criteria, as well as the Engineer of 2020 report, list lifelong learning as a critical attribute of future engineers. While exercises can be embedded in engineering curricula that promote independent learning, assessing the level at which lifelong learning has been achieved is difficult. The first year engineering curriculum at Louisiana Tech University provides activities that support development of lifelong learning skills. Examples include the requirement of student attendance at professional society meetings or service functions and independent research into global and societal issues that are likely to influence their careers. Our project-based curriculum requires skills beyond those imparted in the classroom. For example, students must learn with little or no classroom instruction to create parts and assemblies with a 3D modeling tool, to diagnose technical problems with their projects, and to learn to implement sensors as part of their design projects. By analyzing student questionnaires and curricular content, we measure the numbers of activities that promote lifelong learning as well as the extent to which these activities are completed independently. This paper will provide an overview of our first year engineering experience as well as the assessment results that help us measure the extent of lifelong learning. Background and Introduction Criterion 3H (Program Outcomes) of the 2008-2009 ABET EAC requires that engineering programs instill within their students “a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning”. Though all engineering programs recognize the need for providing their students with tools to continue to learn new tools and strategies throughout their professional career, many experience difficulty determining methods to measure how well their curricula instill lifelong learning attributes. The Engineer of 2020 discusses “the imperative for engineers to be lifelong learners,” noting that technology changes rapidly and that engineers frequently change careers. Litzinger et al. noted that lifelong learning can occur in two modes: formal and informal. The formal mode includes university courses, and the informal mode refers to learning that takes place naturally as an individual learns to accomplish a task. We believe that project-intensive educational experiences provide fertile ground for practicing both modes of lifelong learning. Nelson described a general education class targeted to engineering and technology students. The primary objectives of the class were to provide students with the opportunity to think reflectively on merits and drawbacks of technology in a personal as well as global and societal context and to promote lifelong learning and skills. Assignments and discussions that help students develop their own opinions and attitudes regarding the impact of engineering and technology on global and societal issues instill a passion for learning in some students. Most people naturally want to do something in their lifetime that benefits society, so discussing “the bigger picture” can be an important motivator for sustained lifelong learning. P ge 14619.2 Gustafson, McCaul, and Soboyejo conducted a survey of 280 alumni during the academic year 2000-2001. Asked how their undergraduate experiences could have better prepared them for their professional careers, their top four responses included: ≠ Changes in the content of engineering courses, including the use of current technology and software, more industry interactions, and real-world context; ≠ More involvement in professional organizations; ≠ An increased use of trade/professional publications within the curriculum; and ≠ Increased focus on professional skills, including ethics, teamwork, and communication. Several have reported the need to teach and encourage students to use library resources such as trade publications and journals as well as electronic databases to find information for help with projects or research papers. In some cases, alumni have strongly encouraged their universities to incorporate the use of such resources, realizing that they themselves would have benefited from an earlier introduction to using these resources. Several studies have evaluated the role of confidence as a facilitator of or inhibitor to learning. McElhoe, Kamberelis, and Peters found that in teaching computer skills to non-traditional students, the confidence that the students gained in using computers was more important to the students than the actual skills that they learned. Norman and Hyland examined the role of confidence in lifelong learning with a group of student teachers. They determined that a lack of confidence influenced the student teachers to be more self-critical of themselves and anxious, leading to an avoidance of some tasks. On the other hand, persons with increased levels of confidence were able to adapt to new situations more quickly, enjoy learning more, and interact with others more easily. The student teachers developed confidence in part through discovering and practicing new teaching methods, self-management, and interactions with others, particularly to gain help. Our approach to encouraging the development of lifelong learning skills and attitudes is to couple practice in self-learning with an innovative classroom spirit. This paper describes a first year engineering curriculum that seeks to instill an attitude of lifelong learning in our students by ≠ Including project based educational experiences that provide formal and informal modes of lifelong learning; ≠ Coupling engineering and technology with discussions on global and societal issues to motivate lifelong learning; ≠ Requiring that students attend professional society meetings on campus to provide an avenue for self-learning as they enter their careers; and ≠ Incorporating current technology and open-ended design to promote self-learning and most importantly, confidence. We first provide an overview of our freshman experience and then discuss our strategies for promoting and measuring lifelong learning. The First year Engineering Curriculum: “Living with the Lab” All engineering students at Louisiana Tech enroll in an integrated curriculum designed to incorporate many of the educational practices of the National Science Foundation Educational Coalitions. Students complete three engineering courses (ENGR 120, 121 and 122) which are P ge 14619.3 implemented as combined lecture / laboratory classes and which meet twice each week for ten weeks for 110 minutes per meeting, as shown in Table 1.Our freshman integrated curriculum includes differential and integral calculus courses, basic chemistry lecture and laboratory courses, and a calculus-based physics course; students also typically enroll in several nontechnical courses during the first year. The first year integrated courses are taken in “blocks” so that classes of 40 students take the same sections of each mathematics, science and engineering course during each quarter. The topics presented in the mathematics and science courses are coordinated to some degree with the topics presented in the engineering courses to motivate student learning and to provide for content overlap. Table 1. First-year technical courses.

Our first year experience boosts experiential learning through student ownership of a “laboratory” platform in a new curriculum that we call “Living with the Lab.” Approximately 800 first year students enrolled in the new curriculum between the fall of 2007 and the winter quarter of the 2008-09 academic year. The Living with the Lab Concept. Our faculty members have found that when teaching traditional laboratory and shop classes, making certain that all necessary equipment and supplies are ready before class can be difficult. Sustaining this effort with large numbers of students over time may not be feasible. Assignment of projects to students or student groups who have purchased their own robotics kits makes it possible for the “laboratory” or “design platform” to travel with the students to the places where they spend their time – their dorm rooms or apartments, or even the local coffee shop. When students control and maintain their own hardware, significant increases in experiential learning is possible; students are Living with the Lab. The end result is more hands-on student activity without an excessive investment of faculty time. The Hardware Platform. The major aim of the Living with the Lab curriculum is to create innovative students with a can-do spirit through a project based curriculum where students repeatedly apply technology and fundamentals to solve problems. The new curriculum boosts experiential learning by putting the ownership and maintenance of the “lab” into the hands of the students. Each student must purchase a robotics kit (~$110) with a programmable controller, sensors, servos, and software, along with a toolkit (~$70) that together provide the basis for a mobile laboratory and design platform. A basic tenet of the curriculum is that student-owned labs motivate student learning and broaden the spectrum of projects and design topics that can be addressed, thus facilitating innovation. We have adopted the Boe-Bot platform sold by Parallax, in part because the kit comes with an excellent tutorial and activities for increased self-directed learning.

880d48a952017a817ac2d26bc50934da0133abd6,Preface,"The International Conference on Applied Sciences Mathematics and Informatics (ICASMI) is a biennial event hosted by University of Lampung that brings together academics, scholars and researchers from around the world to meet and exchange the latest ideas, networking, opening collaboration research and discuss issues concerning all fields of sciences, mathematics, informatics and their application. It also allows representatives of industry, government employers and postgraduate students to have an opportunity to discuss with experts on some issues they concern. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this time the conference was held virtually. This conference was held from 3rd to 4th of September 2020, in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Lampung, Bandar Lampung, Indonesia. Zoom Meeting was utilized as a means of the conference. Each keynote speaker was given 30-minutes for his/her presentation with 15 minutes discussion, while for the oral presentation was held in a parallel session of three or four speakers where each participant was given 10 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes for panel discussion. The participants came from across several institutions and universities from 4 countries. Our initial target participants were 150, fortunately, on the closing date of registration, there were 178 participants who registered from 5 main fields of natural sciences. The main drawback of such virtual conference was the internet connection. A few numbers of speakers had this problem, so they were unable to give their best presentation, however, this drawback did not affect much the quality of this conference. The theme of this year’s conference is “Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Informatics in the Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0 toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” The conference will provide researchers and scientists from mathematics and computer science, researchers from various application areas such as physics, chemistry, life sciences, and engineering, as well as in education and social fields, to discuss problems and solutions in the area, to identify new issues, and to shape future directions for research. We would like to acknowledge all of those who have supported the 3rd ICASMI. Each individual and institutional help were very important for the success of this conference. We would like to thank the keynote speakers who are competent in their field of study and come from different countries, such as, Japan, Malaysia, Turkey and Indonesia, and the organizing committee for their valuable advice in the organization and helpful peer review of the papers. We hope that this conference would be a forum for excellent discussions that put forward new ideas and promote collaborative research. We are sure that the IOP proceedings publication will serve as an important research source of references and the knowledge, which will lead to not only scientific and engineering progress but also other new products and processes.

0d5c617634e26f612042d09d9f05e5a2ee24bbb1,The Onchocerciasis Vaccine for Africa—TOVA—Initiative,"New supportive health intervention technologies, including a vaccine, may be required in order to achieve onchocerciasis (river blindness) elimination targets. A new transatlantic partnership has been established to develop and test an onchocerciasis vaccine for Africa. 
 
This year marks the 40 year anniversary of a partnership between the World Bank’s Africa Region, the World Health Organization (WHO), Merck & Co., and several other key nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and agencies who have led global efforts to control onchocerciasis (river blindness) [1]. By almost any measure, the partnership has achieved extraordinary public health successes. It began as the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) in West Africa, which from 1974 to 2002 initially employed vector control through aerial spraying of insecticides before initiating ivermectin distribution in 1989 [2]. According to WHO, through OCP, tens of millions of onchocerciasis cases were prevented, including an estimated 600,000 cases of blindness [2]. Moreover, OCP successes allowed 100,000 square miles (25 million hectares) of land to be reclaimed for agriculture use [2]. 
 
As OCP wound down, a second major initiative, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) began in 1995, focusing on community-directed mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin in 19 countries. According to a recent analysis in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, between 1995 and 2010, APOC averted more than 8.2 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and will more than double that number by 2015 [3]. Moreover, the costs of these health benefits are below $500 million, or approximately $27 per DALY averted [3], such that APOC has emerged as one of the world’s most cost-effective global public health programs. 
 
These analyses and evidence that the partnership’s activities led to the elimination of onchocerciasis in endemic foci in two African countries—Mali and Senegal [4]—have fueled great interest and optimism in advancing beyond control and perhaps one day eliminating onchocerciasis from Africa [5]. Indeed, APOC may transition to the Programme for the Elimination of Neglected Diseases in Africa (PENDA) in 2016 with the goal to eliminate onchocerciasis by 2025. This is an ambitious goal that will face a number of challenges. 
 
MDA using ivermectin alone may not be sufficient to achieve onchocerciasis elimination. There are several key barriers. First, a known deficiency of MDA programming is the fact that ivermectin cannot be used in areas coendemic to loiasis due to the risk of severe adverse events (SAEs) [6]. Communities in areas coendemic for both onchocerciasis and loiasis often do not receive treatment [6]. This situation both blocks elimination efforts in Loa-affected communities and also creates reservoir onchocerciasis infections that potentially could promote the reintroduction of onchocerciasis in neighboring communities under MDA treatments [6]. In response, Cameroon has implemented programs of post-treatment surveillance and management in areas where loiasis is coendemic with onchocerciasis, but this practice may not always be feasible elsewhere. In addition, it is common in many areas of sub-Saharan Africa to not implement onchocerciasis MDA programs in areas of hypoendemicity, which could also lead to reintroduction in areas undergoing MDA. 
 
Of even greater concern is the potential widespread emergence of partial or complete drug-resistant Onchocerca volvulus, which poses a threat to the long-term effectiveness of using ivermectin alone in all areas [7–9]. 
 
Finally, Turner et al. have recently pointed out that success in achieving onchocerciasis elimination would ultimately require irreversible reductions in O. volvulus microfilariae production by 30–35% following each annual round of ivermectin [9]. However, there is great uncertainty around such estimates [9]. Additional disease modeling studies have suggested that, depending on compliance and levels of parasite transmission, it may not be possible to achieve onchocerciasis elimination even after 50 years of annual ivermectin treatments, thereby necessitating the adoption of biannual treatments, opening the MDA program up to additional logistical and financial challenges [10]. 
 
The development and implementation of new tools (such as drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines) may be required if we are to ensure onchocerciasis elimination. Such products could be used to potentiate or enhance the efficiency of ivermectin treatments and address the identified deficiencies of current MDA programming. Examples of such products include the use of moxidectin in MDA programmes inasmuch as its effect in suppressing microfilaria production for prolonged periods [11]; the development of a macrofilaricidal drug or an antibiotic that targets adult parasite bacterial endosymbionts [12]; the development of a new diagnostic for loiasis infection with improved sensitivity and specificity; and the development of a prophylactic and/or therapeutic onchocerciasis vaccine [13]. 
 
The Sabin Vaccine Institute Product Development Partnership (Sabin PDP) and academic partners in the United States (New York Blood Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Louisiana State University, Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine); Europe (Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Bonn, Imperial College London, and the Natural History Museum of Paris); and Africa (University of Buea, Cameroon, Cameroon Academy of Sciences, and Kwame Nkrumah University, Ghana), have established The Onchocerciasis Vaccine for Africa (TOVA) Initiative, which is pursuing development of an onchocerciasis vaccine (Fig. 1)(S1 Text).

TOVA Initiative traces its origins to initial support of more than $20 million during the 1980s and 1990s from the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, as well as continued support from the European Union to develop molecular reagents, preclinical (laboratory animal) models, understand the effects of infection on the host immunity, and identify key protective antigens across several laboratories in the US, Europe, and Africa. Ultimately, more than a dozen candidate vaccine antigens were identified using small animal models, of which eight were tested in bovines challenged with Onchocerca ochengi [14]. Subsequently, these activities continued with the support from NIAID/NIH, together with the European Union (through its Directorate-General for Research and Innovation). 
 
Based on this past research, there are compelling reasons to believe that an onchocerciasis vaccine may be an effective tool. To date, three candidate antigens have proven to be efficacious in three different filarial animal model systems and in three independent laboratories. A recently published study showed feasibility of eliciting significant protective immunity in mice using selected recombinant Onchocerca volvulus antigens produced in yeast or bacteria, including Ov-103, Ov-RAL-2, and Ov-CPI-2M [15]. Moreover, the Brugia malayi homologous recombinant antigens also elicited protective immunity in gerbils [16] (Klei et al., unpublished). Furthermore, immunization with DNA plasmids carrying the gene encoding Lg-CPI-2M protects mice from patent infection with Litomosoides sigmodontis [17]. 
 
There are at least two potential target product profiles (TPPs) to consider for the development of an onchocerciasis vaccine for Africa. They include the development of a preventive vaccine for use in children five years of age or less, who do not receive ivermectin, or a therapeutic vaccine (targeting either adult worms, microfilariae, the causative agents of pathology and transmission, or both) for children and adults with O. volvulus infection. These TPPs are not mutually exclusive, and they could potentially also include coadministration with ivermectin or even one of the newer macrofilaricidal agents under parallel development [18]. Modeling studies have shown that an onchocerciasis vaccine could have substantial impact in a range of endemicity settings, and when used as a preventive vaccine, could markedly reduce host microfilarial loads in children and adolescents (Turner HC et al., unpublished). 
 
TOVA Initiative is now establishing a roadmap for developing a vaccine to meet one of the two described TPPs, with plans to take at least one candidate forward to phase two trials (proof-of-concept trial for efficacy) by 2020. Among the key activities envisioned for TOVA Initiative is a program of confirmatory preclinical testing, optimization, and down-selection in the O. ochengi–cow model under conditions of natural exposure, together with scale-up process development, pilot manufacture, toxicology testing, regulatory filing, and phase one clinical testing. Indeed, TOVA Initiative is poised to lead on the development of this important new tool to aid in the elimination of onchocerciasis. 
 
An onchocerciasis vaccine for Africa would build on past investments in OCP and APOC and support future investments planned under PENDA to help achieve elimination of onchocerciasis [19]. TOVA has begun to explore innovative financing mechanisms from major foundations, governments in North America, Europe, and elsewhere, as well as some of the major development banks committed to poverty reduction in sub-Saharan Africa. We strongly encourage the global public health community to embrace the prospect of an onchocerciasis vaccine and to incorporate plans for a vaccine’s development into future public policy and strategic plan considerations.",PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,2015.0,35,"{'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003422&type=printable', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4310604, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

dcd1d276be32fc77a9e78744bb0d5e2ad8266d3b,Early Requirement for Bioinformatics in Undergraduate Biology Curricula,"As the world unravels its most impactful event of the century so far – the COVID-19 pandemic, billions of people turn on televisions, tune into radios, and browse websites trying to understand what the epidemiologic graphs are saying; and in most cases, they turn to media and friends asking to explain what these graphs mean. The COVID-19 pandemic has confirmed: there are huge gaps in the ability for the general population to interpret statistical analyses and graphical representation of biological data (Andrew, 2020; Leybzon, 2020; Tracy, 2020). In the current situation, understanding data being a prerogative for only data specialists is gone; every health care professional, biologist, chemist, or any natural scientist have taken on the responsibility for the evaluation of massive amount of the pandemic data and delivering the conclusions to their friends and families. But are we really prepared for such work and responsibility? As classically trained in US biologists, we were never required by undergraduate college programs to dive deep into the quantitative analysis world (Cheesman et al., 2007). We were dealing with enzyme kinetics graphs in biochemistry, but not once did we touch “big data”–with exception to some of our friends who were brave enough to enroll into a biostatistics class as an elective. Only later, in graduate school, some had an opportunity to take bioinformatics courses such as computational biology, systems biology, or statistical programming. Today, there is enough data generated by sequencing, gene expression, bench work on DNA, proteins, and metabolites, thus bioinformaticians have plenty of work to do in phylogenetics, gene expression analysis, genome analysis or an interactome prediction (Hagen, 2000; Gauthier et al., 2019). Many of bioinformaticians either have a computer science background or learned computational analysis in their graduate programs. With the overwhelming amount of data that is available today on any topic, including ecology, biodiversity, epidemiology, we believe that all biologists should receive mandatory training in bioinformatics during their undergraduate years, just as they receive training in organic chemistry or physics. For almost two decades, it has been documented that there is need for undergraduate life science majors to graduate with competency in bioinformatics to help not only scientific progression, but students’ careers as well (Bialek and Botstein, 2004; Pevzner and Shamir, 2009; Levine, 2014; American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2015; Sayres et al., 2018), with attempts to implement data science across life sciences curriculum (Dill-McFarland et al., 2021). However, there are still barriers preventing successful inclusion of bioinformatics into undergraduate life sciences education, including lack of student interest, overly full curricula, lack of student preparation, and faculty members belonging to underrepresented groups (Williams et al., 2019). Here, we discuss our opinions and experiences regarding the inclusion of bioinformatics early in undergraduate life science curricula at Kean University, a Hispanic-serving Institution (HSI). Courses that cover bioinformatics skills should be offered as early as sophomore year, immediately after students complete two semesters of general biology courses and introductory Edited by: Hugo Verli, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil",Frontiers in Bioinformatics,2021.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2021.656531/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9581004, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The largest manufacturers and exporters of textile products are identified. Trends in production capacity changes in the industry over the past years are analysed. The place and role of textile industry development in the context of the implementation of the circular economy principle in line with the EU priorities are substantiated. The main directions of perspective development of the textile industry are identified. Two main national documents that have been developed in Poland which set out the current development directions of the country in the field of sustainable development and environmental protection: Strategy for Responsible Development until the year 2020 (with the perspective until the year 2030) and National Waste Management Plan elaborated in the year 2014. The article provides a detailed analysis of the development of regional industry, including the textile industry based on the city of Lodz (Poland). The identified areas of smart specialisations of the Region of Lodz include the following sectors of economic activity: modern textile and fashion industry; advanced building materials; medicine, pharmacy, and cosmetic industry; power generation (including Renewable Energy Sources); innovative agriculture and agricultural and food processing; computer science and telecommunication. The paper proposes the main directions of the textile industry development in the example of Poland: 1) generation of minimal waste in the production process (1R - with application of the most innovative technology), 2) its maximum re-use (2R), 3) application of the third method within the three R formula (reduce, reuse, recycle) which is recycling (3R), the awareness of the importance of which among producers and citizens in many countries is systematically growing.",Journal of Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University,2019.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.15330/jpnu.6.3-4.67-76', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15330/jpnu.6.3-4.67-76?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15330/jpnu.6.3-4.67-76, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

At its broadest, blended learning describes the introduction of computer labs, interactive whiteboards, and educational software to the learning process. When making recommendations for teaching at higher education institutions in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic with the application of anti-epidemic measures, among the important recommendations was the use of a hybrid learning model for students. Teachers were able to adjust the course of all forms of higher education only after determining that students, given the material and technical conditions and computer skills, can carry out certain activities at a distance. The research implicitly indicates which type of hybrid learning model proved to be the most effective in mastering the course outcome and successful implementation and realization of teaching during COVID-19. The research was conducted at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Osijek (Croatia), at the graduate and postgraduate level from 21st April to 28th June of the academic year of 2020. It was N = 73 respondents. An online questionnaire was conducted via Docs forms. This research will also try to answer whether learning outcomes are more achieved with blended learning.The results showed that most students wanted to have real-time instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic via the Big Blue Button rather than via the Google Classroom, and 94% thought they would better adopt course outcomes than the classic hybrid teaching model. The possibility for the student to organize his / her own workspace, but also to cooperate with other students and teachers in acquiring knowledge, and can be achieved with a precisely designed hybrid model of learning. It is the research that indicates the improvement of the quality of learning and the possibility of active participation of students in the learning process, which thus improves the learning outcomes.",European Journal of Teaching and Education,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://dpublication.com/journal/EJTE/article/download/818/550', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33422/ejte.v4i2.818?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33422/ejte.v4i2.818, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Early in life he came to London, where he pursued his higher education. In 1986, this culminated in his being awarded an M.Sc. in computer science from Birkbeck College, and in March of that year he began his life’s professional career with British Telecommunications plc (BT). He undertook for BT various roles associated with commercial computer project development and management until his early retirement in 1994. Outside of his professional career, Brian had a keen and active interest in bryophytes and was a member of the British Bryological Society (BBS) for more than half a century, having joined in 1963. Post retirement, apart from occasional computer-related consultancies, Brian turned his attention to bryology almost full time. In June 1999, he became a scientific associate at the Natural History Museum, working with the bryophyte collections. Here, he enthusiastically assisted in curatorial matters, from databasing the undigitised bryophyte collections to preparing newly acquired material for incorporation into the British Museum (BM) herbarium. Most recently, while coping with deteriorating health, he processed several thousand specimens donated to BM by the now late Rod Stern, and consequently Rod’s enormous personal herbarium was secured and made accessible to researchers around the globe. Over his bryological career, including during his association with BM, Brian authored more than 145 publications (Appendix 1), both as sole author and in collaboration with other worthy bryologists such as Howard Matcham and the now sadly late Martin Wigginton, Benito Tan and Jan-Peter Frahm. His especially significant collaboration with Martin Wigginton on the African bryoflora is commemorated in a photograph of Martin and Brian that can be found in Martin's own obituary (Hodgetts, 2020). As well as working with fellow veteran researchers, Brian was keen to involve the less experienced in the arts and science of bryology; to this end, he participated in society workshops and authored useful guidance manuals for beginners. Brian, a committed vegetarian, was of a benevolent, calm disposition and enthusiastically sociable. With museum colleagues, he welcomed and entertained members of the international bryological community visiting London and BM, happy to enjoy a glass of wine and evening meal with these many friends from around the globe. His hospitality was often reciprocated when he shared bryological adventures hosted in the visitors’ home countries. In the final few years of his life, ill health, which compromised his powers of memory, kept him away from the museum, and his subsequent death has left a large gap in the life and activities of the BM bryophyte herbarium.",Yearbook for Traditional Music,1882.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': 'CC0', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6908084, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d8150e86319cfc18abf86e6405f1a3c4d7ea2baf,Secondary STEM Teacher Preparation as a Top Priority for the University of the Future:: The UTeach National Replication as a Strategic Initiative,"National calls, such as the National Academy of Science’s Rising Above the Gathering Storm, and President Obama’s Educate to Innovate and 100Kin10, caution against the detrimental effects that a lack of math and science literacy pose to the health of the nation’s economy and call for immediate action to increase the nation’s science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) talent pool by increasing the number of K – 12 STEM teachers. A growing number of universities are responding to this challenge by adopting the UTeach program, making secondary STEM teacher production a university-wide priority through a unique cross-college collaboration. The University of Texas’ UTeach program offers both a STEM degree and secondary certification to teach math, science, or computer science in just four years. UTeach combines rigorous content preparation, pedagogy, and early field teaching experiences into four-year STEM degree plans. The UTeach Institute was established to support the implementation of the UTeach model at universities across the country and currently partners with 35 universities implementing UTeachbased programs in 17 states across the United States. As of Spring 2013, approximately 1,600 UTeach graduates have been produced and that number is expected to rise to 9,000 by 2020. Initial results indicate that UTeach implementation is creating institutional change and establishing programs that are making headway in bringing STEM teacher preparation to the forefront of each university’s mission. This article examines this scale-up experience as an example of a successful model for strengthening university-based STEM teacher preparation. Specifically, we review the implications for the university of the future, and address the necessary institutional changes required for successful program implementation. Our experience shows that successful program implementation in a university setting requires a balanced approach. Clear articulation of operational and instructional program components, structured implementation support, explicit program benchmarks and continuous evaluation of progress must be paired with an awareness of the local context and opportunities for adaptations and innovations to the model.",,2014.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18848/1835-2030/CGP/V06I04/56835?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18848/1835-2030/CGP/V06I04/56835, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1fa0e4bd514d20df44d89db075819c0b132ae857,Aircraft Engine Technology for Green Aviation to Reduce Fuel Burn,"Abstract The NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program Subsonic Fixed Wing Project and Integrated Systems Research Program Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project in the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate are conducting research on advanced aircraft technology to address the environmental goals of reducing fuel burn, noise and NOx emissions for aircraft in 2020 and beyond. Both Projects, in collaborative partnerships with U.S. Industry, Academia, and other Government Agencies, have made significant progress toward reaching the N+2 (2020) and N+3 (beyond 2025) installed fuel burn goals by fundamental aircraft engine technology development, subscale component experimental investigations, full scale integrated systems validation testing, and development validation of state of the art computation design and analysis codes. Specific areas of propulsion technology research are discussed and progress to date. Introduction In 2006, an Executive Order was signed by the President of the United States issuing a National Aeronautics Research and Development Policy and Plan (Ref. 1), part of which was aimed at addressing environmental concerns in the U.S. Aviation System. Goals and objectives were established for reductions in fuel burn, noise and NOx emissions for future aircraft to address their environmental impact. The NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) established the Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP) to develop advanced technologies to address these goals. Four distinct projects were created, one of which was the Subsonic Fixed Wing Project ( SFW), part of whose mission was to develop advanced propulsion technologies for subsonic aircraft in a five to fifteen year timeframe, also known as N+1 to N+2 generation. Today, the SFW Project, together w ith research partners from Industry, Academia, and other Government Agencies, is focusing on developing technologies for the N+3 generational timeframe, or beyond 2025 (Refs. 2 and 3). These are fundamental technologies in the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 1 to 3 range (definition of T echnology Readiness Levels are given in the Appendix) that show potential benefits to address the Project environmental goals when incorporated to systems level applications. The SFW Project is also tasked to develop and validate computer prediction tools at both the component and system level application for future application to advanced aircraft system designs. The NASA ARMD subsequently also established the Integrated System s Research Program (ISRP) to carry forward to large scale, integrated system demonstrations the technologies developed under SFW that show potential benefit for addressing the environmental goals. The Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project (ERA) was created in 2009 to develop those integrated system demonstrations to the TRL range of 4 to 6 in the 2020 to 2025 timeframe, or N+2 generation of aircraft systems (Ref. 4). In order to accomplish these complex demonstrations, ERA too relies strongly on successfully meeting the environmental goals by conducting research with Industry, Academia and Government Agencies through cost share partnerships, research collaborations, and NASA Research Announcements. In Figure 1, the Subsonic Transport System Level Metrics are shown, outlining the environmental fuel burn, noise and emissions reduction goals, the time frame for achieving them, and the baseline defined for comparing with new technologies.

cf39cbb271ccb9fd1a52f435036c5456b4878faa,The Effects of COVID-19 on Faculty in the College of Engineering at San Jose State University,"This paper reports on a survey of all engineering faculty at San José State University (SJSU) in Spring 2020. The purpose of the survey was to determine the impact of the shelter-in-place on faculty. Overall, 104 faculty completed this survey. Based on the number of COE faculty in Spring, 287, this equates to a confidence level of 95% with a margin of error of 8%. Because of this low margin of error, we can be fairly confident that this survey is representative of the faculty teaching in the College in Spring 2020. The majority of the respondents who answered the question about rank were lecturers (58); there were fewer tenure-track (18), tenured (13), adjunct (1), and Teaching Associates (1) responding. Of the faculty who responded to identify their gender, 66 were men and 27 were women. It is interesting to note that there were more responses from newer faculty; 45.1% of the faculty responses were from faculty with five or fewer years teaching at SJSU. The responses of the faculty show that they worried about the health and well-being of their families, friends, and students. As well, they worried about doing their job well despite the changes made to classes when the classes moved 100% online. Most faculty (60%) took training to learn about online tools; the most common training was for audio or video conferencing tools, Canvas, controlled testing environments, and online videos or tutorials. The tools used by faculty after the shelter-in-place was different than before with inperson classes. More faculty used audio and video conferencing tools (90.6%), webcams (77.3%), online videos or tutorials (68.8%), and YouTube (50%). Faculty reported that students indicated they had issues with several digital technologies after the classes moved 100%. More than 2/3 of students have problems with Internet connectivity either always or sometimes during Spring 2020. Also, more than 50% of the students had issues with a physical space for studying and webcams. Review of the Literature In Spring 2020, after COVID-19 forced most colleges and universities to change quickly to 100% online instruction, the Higher Education Data Sharing Consortium (HEDS) surveyed students, faculty and staff across the U.S [1] about their experiences. 4,000 faculty from 28 different colleges and universities participated in this study that assessed responses from faculty in four areas: Worries and stress, experiencing a lack of control, communication and support from their institutions, and factors that impacted their stress and worry. The HEDS survey found that over 50% of faculty worried often or very often in six of the eleven areas in the survey. The results were that faculty worried about • Health and well-being of your students (75% of faculty) • Health and well-being of your friends and family (74% of faculty) • What the future holds for this institution (70% of faculty) • Doing your job effectively despite changes in work environment (56% of faculty) • Health and well-being of your colleagues (52% of faculty) • Your health and well-being (51% of faculty) The HEDS survey also asked faculty about stress related to the spread of COVID-19. In this question, faculty reported higher stress levels than staff—45% of faculty reported some stress while 49% of faculty reported a great deal of stress. Faculty also noted that they felt overwhelmed by work and felt the pressure from deadlines with more faculty reporting that they often or very often felt overwhelmed. Specifically, 61% of faculty felt they had too many things to do, 55% felt that they were in a hurry, and 51% felt under pressure from deadlines. This result agrees with a study conducted by The Chronicle of Higher Education [2]. The Chronicle survey included responses from 1,122 faculty at 2-year and 4-year institutions. The Chronicle survey found that the levels of stress among faculty had increased dramatically when compared to a prior survey in 2019. 69% of faculty in Fall 2020 reported feeling extremely or very stress compared to only 32% in 2019. The increased stress levels appear to lead to faculty feeling overwhelmed: 74% of women faculty and 63% of men faculty reported that their work-life balance had deteriorated and 82% of women faculty and 70% of men faculty reported that their workloads had increased. Tyton Partners, in conjunction with Every Learner Everywhere [3] completed another survey of faculty. This survey targeted faculty in 2-year and 4-year institutions. 4,798 faculty from over 1,500 institutions responded to this survey (1,102 from 2-year and 3,623 from 4-year institutions). They found that 91% of faculty transitioned their in-person courses to online in Spring 2020. Of these faculty, less than half had taught online before. The most significant challenge that faculty had was engaging and motivating students after the move online (63% of faculty at 2-year and 60% of faculty at 4-year institutions). This agree with the students who responded to an ASEE study of engineering faculty, administrators and students [4]: 61% of the students in the ASEE study agreed with the statement “It is difficult to remain engaged and motivated while working/studying from home.” The Tyton Partners survey [3] also found that faculty who used a wider range of instructional techniques were more satisfied with the student learning in their now-online classes. This finding was replicated in the Suddenly Online study by Digital Promise and Langer Research Associates [5] which surveyed a randomized nationwide sample of 1,008 undergraduates, 717 attending four-year colleges and 271 attending two-year colleges, whose classes were converted from inperson to online after the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The Suddenly Online study by Digital Promise and Langer Research Associates study found that student satisfaction dropped after the move online. 51% of students were very satisfied with their course pre-COVID-19. This number dropped to only 19% of students saying they were very satisfied after the move online. The Tyton Partners study [3] found that most faculty had never used video conferencing tools before the move online: the survey reported that only 21% of faculty had used video conferencing before COVID-19. An additional 49% of faculty started using video conferencing after the courses moved online. There are few studies that assessed the experiences of engineering faculty. The Tyton Partners study [3] looked at science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty because these faculty had unique experiences compared to faculty in general. 46% of STEM faculty in the survey taught a course with a lab component, taught introductory courses (70%), taught large classes with over 100 students (40%) and taught gateway classes (70%). STEM faculty had difficulties transitioning courses with a lab component to a 100% online environment. The survey reported that STEM faculty made these adjustments to their lab courses in Spring 2020: worksheets or readings for students to learn the material (49%), simulations (42%), YouTube or publicly available labs for students to watch (31%), held live labs over video conferencing (26%), implemented distant in-person labs (13%) and eliminated the labs from the class (11%). ASEE conducted a survey of more than 207 faculty, administrators and students in June and July 2020 [6]. This study also found that the loss of lab and hands-on instruction was the leading problem faced in engineering because of the move online due to COVID-19 with 120 of the respondents mentioning this issue. Another university similar to SJSU, CSU Long Beach, conducted a survey of engineering after the move online in Spring 2020 [7]. They received completed surveys from 110 faculty and 627 students from six engineering departments at CSU Long Beach. The researchers found that faculty had several challenges with the online instruction during Spring 2020. “Close to 15% of the faculty had issues with software license or no access to personal computer/tablet. About 20% of the faculty did not have access to microphone/headset or printer/scanner. 23% of faculty had no reliable internet connection, while 32% had no access to webcam or camera for the online instruction. Finally, 47% of the faculty indicated that they had no access or technical difficulties with online writing tools” [7, p. 3]. Computer Science faculty were surveyed in June 2020 by Bizot et al [8]. 450 faculty responded to the survey which had been distributed to the Computing Research Association (CRA) and the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) mailing lists. The faculty reported that they changed their pedagogical techniques after the move online. Before moving online, 250 faculty had used active learning in their classes. After moving online, 34.9% discontinued active learning, 43.4% made minor changes and 21.3% made significant changes. Collaborative projects and labs were also impacted by the move online. Of the 180 faculty who used collaborative projects, 13.9% discontinued them, 71.7% made minor changes, and 14.4% made significant changes. Of the 166 faculty who had courses with a lab component, 9.1% discontinued the lab, 64.6% made minor changes and 26.2% made significant changes. The faculty also reported more concerns about academic integrity issues: 23.1% of the faculty observed more integrity issues than under normal circumstances after the move online. The Computer Science faculty felt higher levels of stress in shifting online. When asked if shifting to online teaching was difficult and stressful, 24.8% strongly agreed and 41.6% agreed. Most faculty reported challenges while teaching online. 74.6% of faculty felt it was hard to implement their preferred teaching style and 65.6% of faculty felt that it took a lot more time teaching than in a normal semester.",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37856.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37856?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37856, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d24a6558cff67bcc5f5263ae270ac39b3ccaa86f,Conducting STEM Industry Internships while Sheltering in Place: The Biotech Partners Experience,"Before the shelter-in-place orders began, Biotech Partners (BP) was already engaged in contingency planning with its school and industry partners in an effort to mitigate potential disruptions caused by the looming health crisis. For 25 years prior, BP had successfully mentored and prepared underrepresented high school students to complete professional internships at diverse STEM institutions. Often working in a laboratory or pharmaceutical manufacturing setting, the internships allowed students to apply bioscience, biotechnology, and professional career skills developed in school within the context of a professional workplace. The promise of paid internships in a cutting-edge industry creates an incentive to motivate and maximize student learning in rigorous academic training and workforce preparation. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, most industry sites cancelled their 2020 participation, putting the summer internships in jeopardy. BP rapidly shifted. Collaborating with new and longstanding industry partners, the internship program was modified from in-person to remote work and learning environments. This case study examines the pedagogical challenges and opportunities of conducting remote STEM internships amid a global pandemic. This paper illuminates the role of industry partnerships, student outreach, personalized mentoring, and wrap-around support services to broaden students’ awareness of, interest in, and preparation for careers in the STEM workforce. INTRODUCTION When the school shutdowns and stay-at-home orders began in March 2020, Biotech Partners (BP) was already engaged in conversations with industry partners about the public health crisis and potential impacts on school-based learning and summer internships. For 25 years prior, BP had successfully coordinated industry internships for high school students predominantly underrepresented in STEM to work at private or public sector STEM institutions, such as, Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Buck Institute for Research on Aging, East Bay Municipal Utility District, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. For six to eight weeks each summer, rising 12th graders enrolled in a BP Biotech Academy, based at one of four Bay Area high schools, have the opportunity to apply for paid positions, working 20 hours per week for 6-8 weeks, usually in a research lab or pharmaceutical manufacturing role. The internships allow students to expand their emerging biotechnology lab skills, knowledge of bioscience subjects, and professional career skills developed in school through on-the-job training under the guidance of a professional mentor. Throughout the school year, students participate in BP’s hands-on curriculum that embeds biotechnology content in career technical education, preparing them in molecular biology, microbial cell culture, biochemistry, lab tools and equipment, computer and other skills, including over 40 Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) labs. The curriculum is reviewed annually by participating teachers and industry partners to ensure core biotech concepts align with evolving industry standards and science education frameworks. BP staff collaborate closely with the classroom teachers to prepare labs and curricular materials, provide instructional support in the classroom, and offer students personalized mentoring and tutoring in a range of subjects to support their academic learning and social-emotional development. The incorporation of paid industry internships helps engage youth and motivate them to persist in rigorous academic training and professional preparation for the workplace. In the winter of 2020, things changed dramatically. While the region reeled from the immediate medical and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, BP rapidly shifted to conConducting Internships while Sheltering in Place – Gurn et al. Vol. 4, Issue 4, October 2021 Journal of STEM Outreach 2 ditions on the ground. As the pandemic unfolded, most past industry sites began cancelling 2020 participation. Facing the prospect of interrupted summer learning opportunities, BP responded early, collaborating with new and longstanding industry partners to rethink and expand the internship program. BP managed to secure internship placements for all students who applied. Doing so required quickly designing new internship solutions. Host sites needed assistance to structure and implement internships virtually. Students applied for mostly remote/virtual internships that extended their academic learning to professional practices within life science/biotech fields. One partner site (Agenus West LLC) hosted in-person internship experiences for a small cohort of students. Working closely with scientists across three organizations (BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Data Carpentry, and The Jackson Laboratory), BP developed and led a data science internship track consisting of virtual bootcamp workshops in data science concepts, Python coding, and bioinformatics, followed by mentored projects exploring data related to cancer research, immunology or COVID-19 in real-time. Pivoting to support students’ distance learning and pilot virtual internships for the first time required BP staff to increase its direct support for youth participants and industry partners. Host sites needed assistance to structure and implement internships using digital and remote learning strategies. For many students, socio-economic uncertainties, emotional and mental health needs, and family financial obligations expanded during the pandemic, creating pressures on some students to work “under the table” or essential jobs. Despite continued restrictions on in-person learning, BP maintained regular communication with students and provided wraparound services when needed to address housing and food insecurity or mental health issues. This case study reflects on the unique challenges and opportunities of transitioning from in-person STEM internships to virtual learning environments. With a focus on the pedagogical context of training and mentoring high school students, we present multiple stakeholder perspectives through extended interviews with youth, industry partners, mentors, and biotech educators. By assessing the complex constraints of conducting remote internships in the midst of a pandemic, this paper illuminates the importance of industry partnerships, individualized student support, and other promising strategies to motivate students to become aware of, interested in, and prepared for careers in the STEM workforce. Conceptual Framework: Industry Internships with “At Promise” Youth. BP’s biotech workforce training model combines academic and career technical education programming with extensive wrap-around student support. The program connects high school students, predominantly youth from demographics underrepresented in STEM fields, to bioscience professionals and organizations through both school-based academic and workforce preparation and industry-based internships. By building relationships across public schools and STEM industry partners, BP creates personal-professional connections between individuals and institutions that do not frequently intersect without intervention (Austin and Seitanidi, 2012; Seitanidi and Ryan, 2007). Through laboratory-based coursework, personalized supports, professional learning workshops, and paid industry internships, students develop interpersonal, academic, and career-oriented learning experiences in and out of school. Key constituents of BP’s internship program include: • Culturally and socio-economically diverse students at partnering high schools and community colleges who apply to participate in specialized biotechnology coursework and industry internships, • Classroom bioscience teachers who design and lead coursework and engage in teacher learning to support students’ preparedness for internships, • Industry professionals at biotech and science institutions across private and public sectors who volunteer to create or supervise student internship experiences, and • BP program coordinators and administrative staff who collaborate with and support participating students, teachers, and industry mentors. BP program coordinators play especially critical roles to understand the unique needs and strengths of the students and the school community. With one or more program coordinators embedded in each school, these educators provide key supports to build and maintain student engagement through BP’s rigorous school-year academic programming and the summer internship placements. In contrast to educational research and policy that frame underrepresented students and communities as “at risk,” BP intentionally views young people as “at promise,” capable of great things when given the opportunity and adequate support for personal and academic growth (Drake, 2017; Whiting, 2006). As one BP administrator explained, the notion of youth as “at promise” reflects a conscious language choice and conceptual focus on the resilience, persistence, and potential of all learners when they are supported appropriately. Rejecting deficit models of learning that situate student achievement solely or primarily within individuals’ choices and behaviors, BP tackles the socioeconomic obstacles and educational conditions that enable or constrain student achievement (Ladson-Billings, 2006). BP educators create supportive learning environments and provide wrap-around services to help students overcome obstacles that affect access, readiness, and participation in education. BP’s mentorship approach relies on the development of Conducting Internships while Sheltering in Place – Gurn et al.

371512a54d28450332a4a9b42dc96d3c3a9eba70,CHEERS to 30 Years of PharmacoEconomics,"PharmacoEconomics celebrates 30 years of publishing this year. The journal was launched as an Adis journal in January 1992 and was the first international peer-reviewed journal to exclusively promote and publish research on the practical application of economics to pharmacotherapy. Originally intended as a monthly subscription review journal, it also accepted research articles as there was insufficient research to provide enough material for review articles. Today, the journal continues to publish both reviews and original research. The first editorial reported that 700 articles containing the terms ‘drugs’ and ‘economics’ had been published between 1966 and 1990 [1]. In October 2021, there were almost 22,000 articles within this classification in MEDLINE alone. However, adding ‘cost effectiveness’ as a keyword expanded this to 1.5 million articles, and including ‘quality of life’ added another 330,000. The field has broadened since the early days and now covers analytical methods, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, medical devices, and aspects of health policy, as evidenced by the current scope of PharmacoEconomics. There were over 400,000 downloads of the journal’s articles in 2020, and the journal has a current 5-year impact factor of 5.733. Like all sciences, the discipline of pharmacoeconomics was initially a collective human activity of the privileged, favouring affluent countries with well-established centres of learning, government, and industry. This suggests why articles in the journal have predominantly been from the UK, USA, and Western Europe, accounting for three-quarters of the papers published in 2020. Although the journal has published relatively fewer articles from Eastern Europe, Asia, the Indian subcontinent, South America, Africa, and Oceania, we do see this gradually changing. We might even see an article on the economics of healthcare during wintering over in Antarctica. The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (better known as ISPOR) has over 80 regional chapters across all regions of the world, reflecting the global interest and use of health economics (https:// www. ispor. org/ membergroups/ globalgroups/ regio nalchapt ers). One of our most popular themed issues was devoted to developing nations. In parallel with this, we would also like to further diversify our editorial board and attract members from Africa, Asia, and South America. A key component in the success of any journal is the quality of the editorial board. We would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank all those who have served on the board for their hard work and dedication to the journal. In particular, we would like to note four members of the current editorial board who have served since the beginning: Lyle Bootman, Mike Drummond, Silvio Garattini, and Richard Milne. We would also like to commemorate those members of the first editorial board who have died, including Alan Maynard, who visited NZ in 1991 to advise the editor; Michael Cooper; John Eisenberg, who wrote the first editorial [1]; and Alan Hillman. In 30 years of publishing, there have been changes in topics and emphasis as many more countries require costeffectiveness analysis to inform decisions regarding reimbursement of healthcare interventions. Cardiovascular disease, antibiotic therapy, and antidepressants were some of the initial targets for economic analysis in the journal. Many of the earlier studies were simple cost analyses, assessments of resource utilisation and humanistic burden, economic evaluations alongside clinical studies with small sample sizes (often retrospective chart reviews), and simple models with limited deterministic sensitivity analysis. However, we soon published the first Markov model with a lifetime horizon [2], followed in 1998 by the seminal article on Markov modelling [3]. The development of computer technology has allowed the field to become ever more complex and sophisticated, with increasing reliance on statistical methods (such as value-of-information methods and econometrics) and complex models such as discrete-event * Richard Milne richard.milne@hoa.co.nz",PharmacoEconomics (Auckland),2021.0,2,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40273-021-01111-9.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8683310, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

171828282b592bfc5aada57ff22c1f4b5c6eacd5,Power of Enumeration -- BDD/ZDD-Based Techniques for Discrete Structure Manipulation,"Summary form only given. Discrete structures are foundational materials for computer science and mathematics, which are related to set theory, symbolic logic, inductive proof, graph theory, combinatorics, probability theory, etc. Many problems are decomposed into discrete structures using simple primitive algebraic operations. A Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) is a representation of a Boolean function, one of the most basic models of discrete structures. After the epoch-making paper [1] by Bryant in 1986, BDD-based methods have attracted a great deal of attention. The BDD was originally developed for the efficient Boolean function manipulation required in VLSI logic design, however, later they are also used for sets of combinations which represent many kinds of combinatorial patterns. A Zero-suppressed BDD (ZDD) [2] is a variant of the BDD, customized for representing a set of combinations. ZDDs have been successfully applied not only to VLSI design, but also for solving various combinatorial problems, such as constraint satisfaction, frequent pattern mining, and graph enumeration. Recently, ZDDs have become more widely known, since D. E. Knuth intensively discussed ZDD-based algorithms in the latest volume of his famous series of books [3]. Although a quarter of a century has passed since Bryant first put forth his idea, there are still many interesting and exciting research topics related to BDDs and ZDDs [4]. One of the most important topics would be that, Knuth presented an extremely fast algorithm ""Simpath"" [3] to construct a ZDD which enumerates all the paths connecting two points in a given graph structure. This work is important because many kinds of practical problems are efficiently solved by some variations of this algorithm. We generically call such ZDD construction methods ""frontier-based methods."" The above techniques of data structures and algorithms have been implemented and published as an open software library, named ""Graphillion""[5], [6]. Graphillion is a library for manipulating very large sets of graphs, based on ZDDs and frontier-based method. Graphillion is implemented as a Python extension in C++, to encourage easy development of its applications without introducing significant performance overhead. In order to organize an integrated method of algebraic operations for manipulating various types of discrete structures, and to construct standard techniques for efficiently solving large-scale and practical problems in various fields, A governmental agency in Japan started a nation-wide project: ERATO MINATO Discrete Structure Manipulation System Project in 2009. The project was successfully finished in this year, and a successor project, JSPS KAKENHI(S), is now running until 2020. Many interesting research results were produced in the last ERATO project, and some of topics are still attractive to be explored more. In this talk, we first show an overview of our research project, and then explain the basic techniques of BDDs and ZDDs used for various discrete structure manipulation. We also present a brief history of the research activity related to BDDs and ZDDs. We then show an overview of the frontier-based method for efficiently enumerating and indexing the solutions of combinatorial problems. We also present several topics on various applications of those stateof- the-art techniques.",IEEE International Symposium on Multiple-Valued Logic,2016.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ISMVL.2016.49?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMVL.2016.49, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Educational practitioners are greatly concerned about this continued underrepresentation. It is also of deep concern to A Better Chance, Inc. (ABC), a 27-year-old national nonprofit talent search and referral organization that identifies talented minority children from predominantly inner-city families for placement in some of the country's most selective independent preparatory schools and a few select public secondary schools. At ABC we view competence in mathematics and science as a sure route to career opportunities in such fields as aerospace technology, architecture, chemistry, computer science, engineering, environmental sciences, and physics. We recognize that such increased opportunities for minorities will help America remain competitive in an increasingly internationally oriented society where technological skill is the major currency. According to the 1980 U.S. Census, by the year 2000 one of every three Americans will be a member of a minority group. Between 1989 and 2020 the combined population growth rate for Blacks and Hispanics is estimated at 50 percent while that of all other ethnic groups is expected to decline by 23 percent. These changes will rapidly increase the number of minorities in the workforce. Clearly, if the overwhelming majority of minority workers is technologically incompetent, America's position as a technological leader is in jeopardy. In the face of this impending reality, new and innovative methods of identifying, recruiting, and educating all minority youth in mathematics and science must be sought and supported. The work of A Better Chance has long been based on the hypothesis that a pool of broadly talented minority students exists whose abilities are best identified by criteria additional to the quantitative measures traditionally employed for student assessment, mainly standardized testing. To confirm this hypothesis ABC conducted two studies which revealed the following: (1) The success of ABC students in ABC schools is not necessarily predicted by standardized test scores.",,1990.0,24,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2307/2295574?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2307/2295574, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

71d44a25145d411b353ca57cc29ee862c02a4a01,Innovative and Timely Approaches to Suicide Prevention in Medical Education,"There has never been a timelier moment to focus on suicide prevention. Science is providing new answers about risk and prevention, the public is more interested than ever in mental health and suicide prevention, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only furthered the need to protect the resilience of patients and health professionals. The June 2021 issue of Academic Psychiatry features innovative approaches to training related to suicide prevention and support for trainees. Public interest in suicide prevention has been growing exponentially. Attitudes toward mental health and suicide were already evolving in positive ways pre-pandemic: more than 90% of US adults viewed suicide as generally preventable and mental health as or more important than physical health [1]. During the pandemic, attitudes shifted toward an even greater sense of urgency and concern about suicide. Twenty-five percent of Americans reported accessing mental health care in some way during the pandemic, including through technological and virtual means [2]. An unprecedented number of legislative acts related to mental health and/or suicide prevention have been passed into law in 2020: 5 federal and 27 state laws [3], which speak to advances in the science and many people speaking out, elevating the experiences of suicide loss and lived experience, culminating in tremendous political will and culture change. In short, especially now during the COVID-19 pandemic, the USA has great societal resolve to address this leading cause of death [4]. But even while US culture has been opening up to the critical importance mental health plays in life, the national suicide rate has been increasing, by 35% from 1999 to 2018 [5]. On December 22, 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released 2019 data showing the first year-over-year decrease in 20 years [4]. Thus, during the period when attitudes were progressing and stigma diminishing, suicide rates were rising; attitudinal shifts are important, even necessary, but clearly not sufficient to prevent suicide. Public interest must progress to action—in the form of implementation of interventions that have been demonstrated to save lives. These interventions, developed for community and clinical settings, need to be scaled widely enough to reach those whose risk may be escalating, an ever-changing subgroup within the larger population. Interventions can also be developed for various points along the continuum of suicide risk, from universal primary prevention efforts to more targeted approaches even during the moment of acute crisis. Upstream interventions in suicide prevention refer to universal approaches that, like the Good Behavior Game, a classroom management system for early elementary school, can increase protective factors like coping and self-efficacy and reduce risk factors that later could increase suicide risk [6]. Targeted interventions provide opportunities for risk reduction by identifying individuals with higher suicide risk and providing them with specific interventions. Only in recent years has the field of suicide science developed and evaluated such approaches, producing a body of new tools and evidence, growing each year. A nationwide initiative called Project 2025 [7] focuses on implementation at a broad scale, with the ultimate goal of decreasing the US suicide rate by 20% by 2025. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention conducted a modeling exercise based on the best suicide preventive science, which pointed to three settings where missed opportunities could be replaced with evidence-based risk-reducing interventions to save the most lives: health systems (e.g., primary care, emergency departments, and behavioral health), correctional settings, and firearm-owning communities. Health care settings loom large in this data-driven suicide prevention initiative, as the 20% by 2025 goal can only be reached through health system change and by training health care professionals in the best ways to detect and reduce suicide risk. * Christine Yu Moutier cmoutier@afsp.org",Academic Psychiatry,2021.0,8,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40596-021-01459-2.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8099389, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3439ad24f931ab4984c789a8f3effc38ca166cd5,‘We are the (simulation) champions – evaluating the role of simulation champions to enrich the diversity of simulation practice placements within higher education institutions undergraduate healthcare programmes’,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant impact on undergraduate healthcare practice placement education [1]. In response, the Scottish Government, committed to ensuring Adult and Mental Health Nursing, Midwifery, and Paramedic Science students have adequate provision to student placements, awarded Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) funding to develop simulation placements. Within our HEI a Clinical Skills and Simulation Team (CSST) has been created comprising 3 Lecturers, a Simulation Technician, and a Digital Technologist. The team then built a Simulation Champions group (n=30) through fostering working relationships, to help promote simulation-based education (SBE) pedagogy across the HEI. The purpose of this study is to explore whether creating a simulation champions group has any impact on the delivery of simulated practice placements within undergraduate healthcare programmes.
 The Simulation Champions are a diverse group comprised of internal academic faculty and external National Health Service (NHS) partners (such as practice education facilitators) who are passionate educators in SBE. Each external partner has a contact within the HEI, aligned to their area of clinical expertise. Through an agreed Terms of Reference, their aim is to enhance, resource, and assist the delivery of high-quality, high-fidelity simulation placements to students by working collaboratively in line with the relevant professional body standards and proficiencies [2]. The CSST oversee the Simulation Champions, providing strategic direction, leadership, following the HEI strategy [3], and support the delivery of Simulation Placements. The group meets every quarter to discuss simulation practices, explore Continuous Professional Development (CPD) opportunities, and share knowledge and learning. The impact of this team will be measured through staff and student reflection using a framework to objectively analyse scenario diversity, achievement of learning outcomes, and alignment to professional body proficiencies.
 Following ethical approval, a group of Year 1 Adult Nursing students (n=60) will have completed a 40-hour Simulated Practice Placement designed and delivered by Simulation Champions (n=10).
 This study will then evaluate and conclude whether there is a need to create and develop a diverse, multi-professional Simulation Champions Group before successful Simulated Practice Placements can be achieved. It will also help determine if securing strong working relationships ensures a smooth transfer of knowledge and skills from clinical practice to the simulation setting within a HEI, and if all of this enhances the student experience.

c58e8e6bf1d1655cbb6be7192d9c849f25ea1bb8,Editorial 2022,"A new year brings exciting changes to Molecular Ecology Resources including additional issues and opportunities to further reach underrepresented groups in the community. After many years of publishing six issues per year, Molecular Ecology Resources has increased the number of issues to eight per year. These two additional issues per year will enable accepted papers to reach final publication more quickly and create opportunity for more special issues. An enthusing addition to the journals this year is the option for authors to submit an abstract in their native language in addition to the English abstract. This provides a great opportunity for authors of all backgrounds to submit their work to Molecular Ecology Resources and reach audiences in their native areas. The Editorial Board of Molecular Ecology Resources expects that efforts to reach a broader audience will create global opportunities and continue to enhance studies in ecology, evolution, and conservation. The journal consistently ranks high among journals in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology based on impact metrics from citation year 2020 including Web of Science (Impact Factor = 7.09), Google h5 index (69), and Scopus CiteScore (11.6). Molecular Ecology Resources aims to publish high quality resources for broad use in the community including computer programs, statistical and methodological advances, and extensive molecular tools. Sequencing and assembly technology continues to advance rapidly which enables powerful studies with broad genomic resources beyond descriptive genome assembly for single species. Thus, the journal no longer accepts manuscripts that provide genome assembly for single species unless the study offers exceptional biological insights or substantial methodological advances. Molecular Ecology Resources will encourage submissions that provide broad genomic resources (e.g., assembly of multiple individuals within or among clades, multiple species, pangenomes) along with demonstrated application to questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation. In support of both open data and benefit sharing best practices, Molecular Ecology Resources requires authors to include a Data Accessibility and BenefitSharing section with their publications. Data for all publications must be archived and the Data Accessibility Statement must be completed with information such as database accession numbers for all data from the manuscript before the manuscript can be published. Further, the journal offers Open Data Badges through a partnership with the Center for Open Science. The Open Data Badge recognizes researchers who make their data publicly available, and these badges are further incentive for authors to participate in the Open Research movement and thus to increase the visibility and transparency of their research. Molecular Ecology Resources also encourages authors to include a BenefitSharing Statement within their Data Accessibility and BenefitSharing section. The BenefitSharing Statement should disclose benefits generated commensurate with the Nagoya Protocol (Marden et al., 2021).",Molecular Ecology Resources,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/1755-0998.13572?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13572, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

03137b213df9dd53f105b360f0729149bcb0da46,"Call for emergency action to limit global temperature increases, restore biodiversity, and protect health","The UN General Assembly in September 2021 will bring countries together at a critical time for marshalling collective action to tackle the global environmental crisis. They will meet again at the biodiversity summit in Kunming, China, and the climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow, UK. Ahead of these pivotal meetings, we—the editors of health journals worldwide—call for urgent action to keep average global temperature increases below 1.5°C, halt the destruction of nature, and protect health. 
Health is already being harmed by global temperature increases and the destruction of the natural world, a state of affairs health professionals have been bringing attention to for decades.1 The science is unequivocal; a global increase of 1.5°C above the pre-industrial average and the continued loss of biodiversity risk catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse.2,3 Despite the world’s necessary preoccupation with covid-19, we cannot wait for the pandemic to pass to rapidly reduce emissions. 
Reflecting the severity of the moment, this editorial appears in health journals across the world. We are united in recognising that only fundamental and equitable changes to societies will reverse our current trajectory. 
The risks to health of increases above 1.5°C are now well established.2 Indeed, no temperature rise is “safe.” In the past 20 years, heat related mortality among people aged over 65 has increased by more than 50%.4 Higher temperatures have brought increased dehydration and renal function loss, dermatological malignancies, tropical infections, adverse mental health outcomes, pregnancy complications, allergies, and cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity and mortality.5,6 Harms disproportionately affect the most vulnerable, including among children, older populations, ethnic minorities, poorer communities, and those with underlying health problems.2,4 
Global heating is also contributing to the decline in global yield potential for major crops, falling by 1.8-5.6% since 1981; this, together with the effects of extreme weather and soil depletion, is hampering efforts to reduce undernutrition.4 Thriving ecosystems are essential to human health, and the widespread destruction of nature, including habitats and species, is eroding water and food security and increasing the chance of pandemics.3,7,8 
The consequences of the environmental crisis fall disproportionately on those countries and communities that have contributed least to the problem and are least able to mitigate the harms. Yet no country, no matter how wealthy, can shield itself from these impacts. Allowing the consequences to fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable will breed more conflict, food insecurity, forced displacement, and zoonotic disease—with severe implications for all countries and communities. As with the covid-19 pandemic, we are globally as strong as our weakest member. 
Rises above 1.5°C increase the chance of reaching tipping points in natural systems that could lock the world into an acutely unstable state. This would critically impair our ability to mitigate harms and to prevent catastrophic, runaway environmental change.9,10 
Global targets are not enough 
Encouragingly, many governments, financial institutions, and businesses are setting targets to reach net-zero emissions, including targets for 2030. The cost of renewable energy is dropping rapidly. Many countries are aiming to protect at least 30% of the world’s land and oceans by 2030.11 
These promises are not enough. Targets are easy to set and hard to achieve. They are yet to be matched with credible short- and longer-term plans to accelerate cleaner technologies and transform societies. Emissions reduction plans do not adequately incorporate health considerations.12 Concern is growing that temperature rises above 1.5°C are beginning to be seen as inevitable, or even acceptable, to powerful members of the global community.13 Relatedly, current strategies for reducing emissions to net zero by the middle of the century implausibly assume that the world will acquire great capabilities to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.14,15 
This insufficient action means that temperature increases are likely to be well in excess of 2°C,16 a catastrophic outcome for health and environmental stability. Critically, the destruction of nature does not have parity of esteem with the climate element of the crisis, and every single global target to restore biodiversity loss by 2020 was missed.17 This is an overall environmental crisis.18 
Health professionals are united with environmental scientists, businesses, and many others in rejecting that this outcome is inevitable. More can and must be done now—in Glasgow and Kunming—and in the immediate years that follow. We join health professionals worldwide who have already supported calls for rapid action.1,19 
Equity must be at the centre of the global response. Contributing a fair share to the global effort means that reduction commitments must account for the cumulative, historical contribution each country has made to emissions, as well as its current emissions and capacity to respond. Wealthier countries will have to cut emissions more quickly, making reductions by 2030 beyond those currently proposed20,21 and reaching net-zero emissions before 2050. Similar targets and emergency action are needed for biodiversity loss and the wider destruction of the natural world. 
To achieve these targets, governments must make fundamental changes to how our societies and economies are organised and how we live. The current strategy of encouraging markets to swap dirty for cleaner technologies is not enough. Governments must intervene to support the redesign of transport systems, cities, production and distribution of food, markets for financial investments, health systems, and much more. Global coordination is needed to ensure that the rush for cleaner technologies does not come at the cost of more environmental destruction and human exploitation. 
Many governments met the threat of the covid-19 pandemic with unprecedented funding. The environmental crisis demands a similar emergency response. Huge investment will be needed, beyond what is being considered or delivered anywhere in the world. But such investments will produce huge positive health and economic outcomes. These include high quality jobs, reduced air pollution, increased physical activity, and improved housing and diet. Better air quality alone would realise health benefits that easily offset the global costs of emissions reductions.22 
These measures will also improve the social and economic determinants of health, the poor state of which may have made populations more vulnerable to the covid-19 pandemic.23 But the changes cannot be achieved through a return to damaging austerity policies or the continuation of the large inequalities of wealth and power within and between countries. 
Cooperation hinges on wealthy nations doing more 
In particular, countries that have disproportionately created the environmental crisis must do more to support low- and middle-income countries to build cleaner, healthier, and more resilient societies. High income countries must meet and go beyond their outstanding commitment to provide $100bn a year, making up for any shortfall in 2020 and increasing contributions to and beyond 2025. Funding must be equally split between mitigation and adaptation, including improving the resilience of health systems. 
Financing should be through grants rather than loans, building local capabilities and truly empowering communities, and should come alongside forgiving large debts, which constrain the agency of so many low-income countries. Additional funding must be marshalled to compensate for inevitable loss and damage caused by the consequences of the environmental crisis. 
As health professionals, we must do all we can to aid the transition to a sustainable, fairer, resilient, and healthier world. Alongside acting to reduce the harm from the environmental crisis, we should proactively contribute to global prevention of further damage and action on the root causes of the crisis. We must hold global leaders to account and continue to educate others about the health risks of the crisis. We must join in the work to achieve environmentally sustainable health systems before 2040, recognising that this will mean changing clinical practice. Health institutions have already divested more than $42bn of assets from fossil fuels; others should join them.4 
The greatest threat to global public health is the continued failure of world leaders to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5°C and to restore nature. Urgent, society-wide changes must be made and will lead to a fairer and healthier world. We, as editors of health journals, call for governments and other leaders to act, marking 2021 as the year that the world finally changes course.",American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,2021.0,6,"{'url': 'https://jhpn.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s41043-021-00262-x', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8488871, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

22c87ec0dae36c2b3259841863c7b709ccfcabc3,"AC 2009-1405: FIRST-YEAR DESIGN EXPERIENCE: ASSEMBLING THE ""BIG PICTURE"" THROUGH INNOVATIVE PRODUCT DESIGN","As part of the freshmen engineering curriculum at Louisiana Tech University, students develop novel solutions to problems that “bug” them. During the spring quarter, students are asked to spend several weeks compiling bug lists – noting products or situations that they think could be improved. The students form teams and decide on which of their bugs they want to address. A creative problem solving approach is demonstrated to the students who generate and evaluate concepts for their solution. The teams then construct increasingly refined prototypes of their new product idea. Serving as the culmination of the experience, a Freshman Design Exposition is held in which the general public, other students, and judges view and provide feedback to the students’ inventions. During the following academic year, the best projects are asked to enter their designs in an Idea Pitch competition which leads to the Top Dawg business plan competition where their ideas can be more formally explored. This paper will discuss our process for Freshman Design, how it fits into the rest of our freshman curriculum, and how this project addresses the NAE’s Engineer of 2020 report. Specifics include: developing the bug list, incorporating the IDEO design process, appreciation of different personality types, brainstorming, engineering decision making, design journals, and prototyping. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative data from the first two Freshman Design Expositions will be presented along with data on the effectiveness of the multidisciplinary nature of the student teams. Background and Context In engineering education, a consensus is forming that passive, lecture-based instruction should be replaced or supplemented by active, integrated, project-based learning. 1 In the United States, the movement toward project-based freshman engineering curricula began in the 1990s due in large part to the National Science Foundation Engineering Education Coalitions. 2-5 This movement towards hands-on freshman engineering programs with a significant design component continues today at universities across the United States. 6-8 A vast body of literature on the subject clearly shows the benefits of incorporating project-based instruction with design early and often. There is no one-size-fits-all freshman engineering design experience. These experiences range from nothing at all, to product dissections, to team-based competitions, to open-ended “product” design, and a host of other approaches. Several papers have attempted to describe and categorize freshmen engineering design experiences in the United States. 2, 9 It is not the intention of this paper to describe the multitudes of programs and their various merits and difficulties. This paper aims to describe an approach to an open-ended product design at the freshman level. At Louisiana Tech University, we began our own engineering curriculum reform in 1995. We created an Integrated Engineering Curriculum (IEC) in an attempt to provide a hands-on, activelearning environment for our freshmen and sophomore engineering students and with support from NSF fully implemented this new curriculum in 1997. 10 The program was successful in P ge 14633.2 increasing retention and graduation rates in our engineering disciplines. Recently, we updated the IEC in order to address several factors described by the National Academy of Engineering’s report: The Engineer of 2020. 11 The newly implemented curriculum relies on a concept entitled Living With the Lab (LWTL). The Living with the Lab Concept In the traditional laboratory and shop settings, faculty members or technical staff must ensure that the required equipment is ready and that supplies are on hand so that project activities can be performed and/or data can be collected. While it’s possible for energetic faculty members to guide students through creative design projects and laboratory experiences in a classroom or laboratory setting, sustaining this effort over a long period of time and with a large number of students is difficult and is sometimes not possible. Our curriculum diffuses this potential problem by transferring ownership of the equipment from the university to the student. Assignment of microcontroller platforms (in the form of easy to use BOE-Bot kits www.parallax.com) to students or student groups makes it possible for the “laboratory” or “design platform” to travel with the students to the places where they spend their time – to their dorm rooms and apartments or to the local coffee shop. Tufts University reports that students appreciate the freedom to work anywhere on their projects; further, they are able to solve the majority of their hardware problems either on their own or with a few tips. 12 When students control and maintain their own hardware, significant increases in experiential learning are possible; students are ""living with the lab"". The end result is more hands-on student activity without the excessive investment of faculty time. This Living With the Lab curriculum has been in full implementation at the Louisiana Tech since Fall 2007, with pilot programs extending back to 2004. Again, NSF funding partially supported the creation and implementation of this new curriculum. The LWTL curriculum is based on seven threads derived from the National Academy of Engineer's ""The Engineer of 2020"" report published in May of 2004. For more information about the Living With the Lab curriculum (including previous publications, syllabi, course schedules, notes, and homework assignments) visit www.LivingWithTheLab.com. Living With the Lab Courses Our original Integrated Engineering Curriculum established connections between freshman and sophomore mathematics, science, and engineering courses. Students were required to take courses in blocks. This block scheduling effectively established learning communities of approximately 40 students in each of the six to seven blocks. This block schedule has been retained and enhanced in the new Living WITH the Lab curriculum. The freshman engineering portion of Living With the Lab consists of a sequence of three courses: ENGR 120, 121, and 122. Students are grouped into cohorts of 40 students in an engineering, math and science courses. Each of the LWTL engineering courses is a two (semester-credit) hour course that meets 20 times during the quarter for one hour and fifty minutes per class. The courses are held in two newly constructed classrooms that are specifically P ge 14633.3 designed for an active, group-based learning environment. Each team of four students is assigned a work table and a work station. The workstations provide access to precision fabrication equipment and a small selection of hand tools for in-class use. Additionally, students are required to purchase various small tools for their own use (multimeters, screwdrivers, calipers, . . .). LWTL course sections are typically serve 40 students (or 20 students in an honors section). A picture of the 1,800 square-foot 40 student classroom can be seen in Figure 1. Figure 1. Panoramic view of freshman engineering classroom. ENGR 120 The first LWTL course introduces the new engineering students to a variety of topics and tools including (but certainly not limited to) circuits, conservation of energy, computer aided solid modeling, Microsoft Excel, computer programming, milling, and soldering. These introductions are made through small projects such as building a centrifugal pump. In order to enroll in this course, students have either scored a 26 on the math section of the ACT, completed a college algebra (or higher) math course, or otherwise proven that they are ready for our first engineering calculus course. ENGR 121 The second course in the LWTL sequence expands on the skills and knowledge gained previously by incorporating a systems level thinking approach. Students are challenged to build a control system that will effectively control the temperature and salinity of a small volume of water. In this course, the students expand their skill set to include topics such as photolithography, conservation of mass, and more in-depth computer logic. Students must complete ENGR 120, and MATH 240 (our first engineering calculus course) with a “C” or better in order to enroll in ENGR 121. ENGR 122 The third course in this sequence is the focus of this paper. There are typically three sections of 40 students each and three honors sections of 20 students each. Along with the design topics, students learn basic statics and engineering economics. The students are also enrolled in the third engineering Calculus course and the first Physics course. As part of the design aspect of this course, students are allowed to demonstrate their mastery of their new skills through an open ended design project. Students are given the task of identifying a problem that ""bugs"" them. By the end of the quarter, the students have imagined concepts, built prototypes, and constructed a product that offers a solution to this problem. This project serves to tie the seven threads of the Living With the Lab curriculum allowing the students to effectively assemble the “Big Picture.”",,2009.0,7,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/5334.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--5334?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--5334, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fa11997769317f431048a4fa2e62221e5e7d3c87,ELECTRONIC LEARNING MATERIALS OR TRADITIONAL- WHICH IS PREFERABLE?,"We live in a world of modern technology. Information technologies surround us at every step, helping us, making our life easier, and providing many benefits. This modern lifestyle is also changing the way we perceive information technology. Few people today can imagine working and learning in everyday life without a computer, laptop, smartphone, or Internet access. The use of electronic teaching aids is a new, modern approach to education. Previously, the use of e-learning materials was the prerogative of distance learning. The main reason was the very limited possibility of personal contact between teachers and students. The issue has become even more urgent given the epidemiological situation around the world. In connection with the massive spread of the new coronavirus infection, students and schoolchildren all over the world were forced to switch to electronic educational resources to continue their studies. In connection with the introduction of similar approaches as in universities and schools, it is very important to prepare future teachers for the correct use of these technologies. Targets and goals. Explore: 1) whether the students are familiar with the electronic teaching aids and whether or not they are satisfied with them; 2) whether students prefer to learn more through traditional printed learning materials or e-learning materials and whether these preferences differ depending on the field of study; 3) Whether students of technical and mathematical specialties prefer electronic teaching materials to traditional printed materials; 4) what sources of information students use in their research work, and to what extent; 5) the advantages and disadvantages of both electronic teaching aids and traditional printed teaching materials. The research focuses on the opinions of 560 students (of which 280 are women and 280 are men) of the Chuvash Pedagogical University about electronic teaching materials and traditional printed teaching materials. The study was conducted from March to November 2020. The survey was aimed at first-year students of various undergraduate disciplines in full-time education in the following specialties: mathematics, physics and information technology, preparation of primary school teachers, history and social science, biology and chemistry, Russian language and literature, Chuvash language and literature, German language and literature, English language and literature. Next, we divided students in accordance with the kinship of areas into 4 groups: a) mathematics + technical and information education, b) training of primary school teachers, c) philology d) social sciences. We used our own questionnaire as a research method. The following methods were used to process the data: analysis of variance, correlation, and Chi-square test. The study showed that freshmen of the Chuvash State Pedagogical University mainly use ready-made methodological developments, the Internet, their own notes, and books as sources of information for their studies. 50% of students are familiar with the concept of e-learning materials, and 32.14% of students became familiar with them in high school or university. The difference between these two data is due to the fact that the concept of e-learning materials was unknown to some students, but when filling out the questionnaire they found that they used this type of materials during their studies. Average student satisfaction with e-learning materials and traditional printed learning materials is almost the same. In addition, it turned out that 65% of students prefer to study using traditional printed materials. It was determined that students studying mathematics and information technology, more than other students, either prefer to learn through e-learning materials or do not prefer one particular type. The most common form of e-learning materials that students have encountered is the LMS. The respondents see the advantages of e-learning materials as consisting of accessibility, clarity, quick access to information, low cost, paper savings (resulting in environmental protection), and interactivity. Although students stated that they prefer to use traditional printed teaching materials, 83% of respondents would like to continue using e-learning materials during their studies.",IJASOS- International E-journal of Advances in Social Sciences,2021.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.18769/ijasos.876356', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18769/IJASOS.876356?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18769/IJASOS.876356, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

832cb3864cecd1575c146373daca0f938c3f6dd0,Pittcon 2019 Report – Pittcon celebrated its seventh decade at Philadelphia,"The 70th annual Pittcon Conference and Expo was held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center from 17 to 21 March (https://pittcon.org/pittcon-2019/). The convention this year marks a number of milestones, with the number of attendees increasing to over 12,500 participants. Pittcon is the world’s biggest conference and expo in analytical chemistry and applied spectroscopy: it covers almost all fields in analytical chemistry including chromatography, mass spectrometry, electroanalytical chemistry, sensors, microfluidics, plasmonics in analytical chemistry, etc. In addition, techniques in applied spectroscopy focuses on infrared (IR), near infrared (NIR), Raman, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), and fluorescence spectroscopy with popular applications in the fields of biomedical and clinical sciences; applications in other fields including nanoscience and technology, pharmaceutical science and engineering, process analysis, food and agricultural engineering including food safety, environmental science, and forensic science also garnered significant attention. This year, Nobel Prize Laureate Professor Fraser Stoddart held the Wallace Coulter Lecture titled, ‘‘Serendipity Stokes Discovery: Disrupting Established Industries,’’ and Dr. Fenella France held the Plenary Lecture, ‘‘Preserving and Revealing History – Challenges of a Cultural Heritage Scientist’’; both lectures were enthusiastically received by full-house audiences. Beyond the keynote lectures, Pittcon offered award symposiums, organized contribution sessions, oral sessions, workshops, poster sessions, and short courses, allowing participants a chance to engage in numerous state-of-the-art presentations. This year, 713 companies from around the world had booths at the Pittcon Expo, including 40 newcomers. The booths displayed topics ranging from computer software to lab equipment custom manufactures, with several companies also hosting Exhibitor Seminars. Beyond the functional discussions, events such as the St. Patrick’s Day Welcome Reception & Poster Session and Pub Pittcon ‘‘Happy Hour’’ allowed participants a chance to unwind from the bustling activity, with the pub alone attracting over 400 people every night with live music and karaoke. Each year, Pittcon presents a variety of distinguished awards for outstanding work in analytical chemistry and applied spectroscopy, including the Pittsburg Spectroscopy Award, the Pittsburg Analytical Chemistry Award, and the Pittsburg Conference Achievement Award to name a few. The Pittsburg Spectroscopy Award—presented annually to only one awardee—has a particularly prestigious history of over 60 years. The list of past recipients counts three Nobel Prize Laureates—Herzberg, Zewail, and Moerner—in addition to a host of other luminaries (Zare, Van Duyne, Pimentel, Hirschfeld, and Griffith) among its rank. This year Yuki (Yukihiro) Ozaki of Kwansei Gakuin University in Japan received this esteemed award for his long-term contributions tomolecular spectroscopy, particularly inNIR,Ramanand far-ultraviolet spectroscopy. His pioneering work in the field includes studies of basic principles, instruments developments, proposals of spectral analysis methods, and applications to various other fields.

97e09e96b0fafd5e5ea4c464f7a159ec87b57b82,Supervised Cytometry,"THERE was long time ago a saying by someone whose name I cannot recall at the moment: “Trust is good but control is better” (Or in other words: Доверие это хорошо. Контроль лучше). This is particularly true for quantitative science and I have addressed this and the relevance of computational tools (1) in several of my previous editorials. Concurrently, a special issue dedicated exclusively to Rigor and Reproducibility guest edited by Peter Lopez and Ruud Hulspas is scheduled for the beginning of the next year. For this September issue, I have collected some publications that are in some way connected to control or supervision. Seeking the support of computers to identify and understand cell populations and their interrelations by flow or image cytometry has a long history in cytometry. Exactly 20 years ago, in an attempt to automatically identify phytoplankton populations from environmental samples artificial neural networks, Frankel and colleagues (2) employed a very early example to apply computing tools for identification of populations in complex cytometric data. Automated ways for data analysis since then have developed substantially, and we will plan to publish in early 2020 a special issue on Machine Learning guest edited by Yvan Saeys and Greg Finak. For quantitative analysis of nuclear distribution of images obtained by image cytometry, Chiabrera and colleagues employed computing tool even earlier, in 1980 (3). In this publication, you find a very early if not the first mention (and coining) of the term Image Cytometry as a way of identifying and quantifying individual cells from microscopic images, an approach that steadily improved and could soon find its way into clinical diagnosis (4). In flow cytometry, a one-shot comprehensive phenotyping of circulating blood cells is with at least 28 simultaneously measurable colors nowadays reality (5,6). The drawbacks of manual analysis of these highly complex data are not a secret, and there is a substantial growth in computational tools for automating population identification. In particular in clinical diagnosis a high level of reproducibility as well as reduction of work load are critical. In this issue, Reiter and colleagues (this issue, pages 966–975) used Supervised Machine Learning combined with multiple Gaussian Mixture Models to identify minimal residual disease (MRD) in pediatric patients with B-ALL. The authors show that their approach is outperforming many presently available supervised methods giving the hope that in an unpredictable but hopefully not too far future implementations into clinical diagnosis are at reach. In image cytometry (7), cell recognition of digital images is a key aspect of quantitative analysis. The most common ways in which this is done by proprietary or open access software such as the Cell Profiler is the identification of cell nuclei in cultured cells or in tissue sections and then using them as Kernels to outline the whole cell or cell section. Here, Caicedo and colleagues (this issue include pp.) employed supervised deep learning to improve cell nucleus recognition. In conclusion, the authors report a remarkable improvement in accuracy in the deep learning approach over classical segmentation algorithms. Importantly, they critically mention two limitations of supervised deep learning compared to classical methods: 1. Manual annotation of the training data is substantially more time demanding and 2. Computational costs and time are much higher than with the classical methods. Supervision is naturally also of high importance at the bench and the flow cytometer. Improved methodologies for their evaluation and instrument comparison are frequently improved and upgraded (7).

d62fe06df173b586c3e5a0b0c7b4967e8c7dab62,Dynamic Tourism Information System Using the Semantic Web,"The semantic web is one of the most promising and emerging areas of computer science. Its ability to make information that is only human understandable to be understood and processed by machines increases its relevance and time efficiency. In this paper we present a semantic web application that contains a dynamic knowledge base holding hotel related information, which is updated at every run from the information provided in the hotels' websites, and a natural language querying platform where the user can enter his free form natural language queries. DL Query is used as the engine that performs the retrieval of data from the ontology. A simple user experiment shows that the system is time effective and helpful in decision making. The area of tourism is one that already uses all the available internet technologies very extensively. The area is ver y dynamic because it is one of the world's largest industries and its growth shows an increase every year. It has been predicted by the World Tourism Organization (2) that by 2020 the tourists travelling around the globe will have increased by more than 200%. Almost all of the travelers rely entirely upon the internet to search out information about their destination, airfares, hotels, areas for sightseeing or shopping etcetera. In (3) it is shown that about 95% of Web users use the Internet to gather travel related information and about 93% indicate that they visited tourism Web sites when planning for vacations. This increase in usage is what has brought about this great rise in tourism information systems present on the World Wide Web, offering structured tourism related information. However, this information is normally isolated from each other and rarely includes details. One can not predict the nature or background of the traveller or his internet search skills. Nevertheless, he has to search each requirement separately, open several web pages, compare information, and then draw his conclusions. The burden of finding data and connecting it to relevant information is placed entirely upon the user. The semantic web is a solution when it comes to reliable searching since it adds meaning to data that the web contains and becomes machine processable, enabling precise and in-depth searching. The application presented in this paper is a dynamic portal for the hotel selection parameter of tourism, based on semantic web standards. Queried information is extracted from the actual websites of the hotels and stored in the dynamic ontology, where from the information is formatted and presented to the user.",,2013.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5963/IJCSAI0303005?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5963/IJCSAI0303005, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

But several months ago, the supercomputer expert and deputy director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in California did just that. He bet Thomas Lippert—a German colleague—$2000 that supercomputer makers wouldn’t create an exascale computer by the beginning of 2020. If built, this next major milestone in supercomputing will be capable of carrying out 10 fl oating-point operations per second, or an exafl op. That’s 57 times as fast as today’s fastest supercomputer, Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Titan, which runs at 17.6 petafl ops (10 fl ops). Such intense computing power could vastly improve everything from climate models to the engineering of engines to work with advanced biofuels. A quick glance at supercomputing trends would suggest that Simon’s bet is a bad one. The improvement of high-performance computers (HPC) has been on an unvarying upward trajectory. The industry marched from the fi rst terafl op (10 fl ops) machine to the fi rst petafl op machine in just 12 years. Extrapolate this steady rate of progress, and supercomputers should reach exascale computing in 2018. But troubles are brewing. Supercomputer experts agree that scaling up existing technology won’t get supercomputers to the exascale level. Intel, IBM, and other hardware makers say they won’t pursue exascale computers without government backing. The United States, China, Japan, Russia, India, and the European Union are all fl irting with exascale plans. But to date, governments have balked at committing the hundreds of millions to billions of research dollars likely to be needed to create the new technology. Just a year ago, supercomputer experts were confi dent that the industry would cross the exascale threshold between 2018 and 2020 (Science, 27 January 2012, p. 394). Now, that confi dence is slipping. “There was a fair amount of traction with exascale,” says Jack Dongarra, a supercomputing expert at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who closely tracks international supercomputing trends. “Some of that is gone now. That’s a big disappointment,” Dongarra says. John Hengeveld, the HPC segment marketing director for Intel in Hillsboro, Oregon, is more upbeat: “I don’t think there has been any setback on the path to exascale.” However, he adds, “there is a question about national will.” For Dongarra, Hengeveld, and many others, the key question is which country will step up to create the fi rst exascale computer. The answer will determine more than who gets bragging rights for leading high-performance computing technology into the future. Because the effort is expected to revolutionize the design of everything from computer logic and memory to the interconnections and software that make them all run, the race could determine which country’s high-tech fi rms are likely to dominate computer technology in the decades ahead.

Now the age of Information Revolution based on intelligence has arrived. In this critical period, the completion of the digital process in the energy sector, the realization of the Information revolution, will directly affect the development of the energy sector Information revolution. The power grid is the basic platform of energy development and utilization, and the State Grid enterprises assume the important social responsibility. Through the construction of the power grid, the Internet of things will be integrated into the digital economy, complete the ""Made in China 2025"" and welcome the arrival of the ""Industry 4.0"". 1. The role of industrial revolution in China In the history of the development of modern human society, there have been three industrial revolutions, each revolution will push the human society to a new height of development. Of course, the world's Lion China also benefited from the rapid development The widespread use of Watt's steam engine in Britain in the 1860s also had an indirect impact on China as it opened its doors to the world and learned advanced science and technology from the West. The development of the Self-Strengthening Movement, the dispatch of foreign students, the establishment of new schools, the planning of coastal defense, the establishment of Jiangnan Machinery Manufacturing Bureau, the rise of various types of enterprises in China, and so on, lead to the development of isolationism China. This industrial technology revolution is known as ""Industry 1.0"" and it was the age of the steam engine [1]. From the 1960s to the early 20th century, electricity replaced steam as an important energy source, marking the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution. At this time, China's domestic and foreign troubles, world capitalism began to develop from liberal capitalism to monopoly capitalism. Imperialist aggression against China shifted from the production of goods to the production of capital, controlling the lifeblood of China's economy. This era is known as ""industry 2.0"" and it is the age of electrification [1]. The third new scientific and technological revolution came in the middle of the 20th century. Represented by the application of atomic energy technology, space technology and computer technology, major breakthroughs have been made in scientific theory and scientific and technological innovation, accelerating the development of the world economy. This is both an opportunity and a challenge for China. With China's reform and opening up, it adjusted the direction of development in time, caught up with the trend of the times, so that China's economy began to take off. This era is known as ""industry 3.0"" [1]. At present, the technological revolution based on artificial intelligence, clean energy, robotics, quantum information technology, virtual reality and biotechnology is rising quietly Known as the ""Industry 4.0, "" this is an era of intelligence in which information technology is used to transform industries, and its arrival will dramatically alter existing modes of production and living. In April 2013, at the German Hannover Messe, the German government officially launched the concept of ""Industry 4.0"" to speed up the process of intellectualization and increase its competitiveness worldwide. In March 2015, Premier Li Keqiang presented the first ""Made in China 2025"" grand plan in the NPC'S report on the work of the government.

The influence of industrial revolution on China's electric power industry Since the mid-1980s, China's power system has undergone three major reforms. The first is reform of the investment system. From relying solely on government investment to introducing foreign investment, encouraging private capital to invest in power construction, solving the problem of power construction funds, has greatly promoted the development of power supply. Second, the separation of factory and network reform. In 2002, the State Council issued document No. 5, which clearly proposed that the former state power companies should be divided into seven according to the principle of ""separating plant networks and bidding on the Internet"", and establish two power grid companies and five power generation groups. This reform adapts to the rapid growth of the national economy and the surge of the demand for electricity, which makes the construction scale of the power grid reach an unprecedented level. The third is a separate reform of resettlement. At the heart of this reform is the dismantling of grid companies in the power production, transport, trade and consumption chains. Power sales, regulation of natural monopoly, liberalization of non-natural monopoly, introduction of competition mechanism, market determines the allocation of power resources. These three reforms have a far-reaching impact on the development of the electric power industry and the national economy as a whole [3]. Every reform faces changes in management systems, models and processes. Prior to the first reform, the power companies were managed in accordance with government management functions and were managed and developed as functional units. GOVERNMENT-ENTERPRISE MERGER MODEL, provincial, municipal and county-level power companies relatively independent, investment and construction funds shortage. After the reform and opening-up, the power investment channel is strengthened, the power grid construction strength is strong, the power grid scale is expanding day by day. With the second reform of the power system, China's power industry has formed a unified power management industry dominated by the two major power grid companies and the five major power generation groups, making the management of the power industry more standardized, professional, and also adapt to modern enterprises. The management request has formed the consummation management business process, the province, the city, the county electric power management department has changed from the function management to the process management. 3. Basic function of electric network In the process of digitalization developing to intelligentization, a new technological revolution will be set off. This year, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) proposed the comprehensive construction of the ""ubiquitous power internet of things"", which is part of the ""Made in China 2025"" and an important strategic layout for SGCC to go to China and realize the ""Industry 4.0"". After more than 140 years' development, China's power industry has realized Regional Power Grid Operation Structure and regional balance of China's power energy. The Electric Power Industry has become an important basis for China's energy transformation and upgrading. Information, digital and smart devices and technologies will be widely used in the power industry. One end of the grid is connected to energy production, and energy consumption is the basic platform for energy development and utilization [5]. It will closely link energy production and energy consumption, lead the pace of the industrial revolution in the energy field, become the forefront of the process of power digitalization and information, will become the leader of the Digital Economy Era.

4eb6dc235b99bb456aac120252c5039e385e30ed,"Stop‐and‐go science: By better understanding traffic flow, researchers hope to keep down highway congestion","W elcome to Los Angeles. The year is 2020. The traffic is, well, worse. Average commuting times are twice what they were in the 1990s. Drivers endure a stop-and-go crawl over almost half the miles they travel. Peak speeds on the region's roads have tumbled. The average rush-hour, roadway speed is 24 miles per hour. These bleak predictions from the Southern California Association of Governments may paint a more troubled picture for L.A. than what's expected for many metropolitan areas. However, the rest of the world's cities won't be far behind. Officials at all levels of government are sorting through a queue of proposals to lessen congestion. They include, for example, better mass transit systems, new road-use fees to influence driver choices, and construction of separate highways for cars and trucks. Meanwhile, scientists and engineers around the globe are trying to figure out how to cram more vehicles onto the existing roadways without putting highway speeds into a nosedive. ""We can't just build more and more roads, so basically we have to try to use the existing capacity more efficiently,"" says Peter Molnar, a traffic scientist at Clark Atlanta (Ga.) University. It's a two-pronged undertaking in which researchers are generating mathematical and computer models of traffic flow and at the same time devising ways to reduce congestion. Some of the new mathematical models, advanced mainly by physicists, deDict traffic as more comDlex and unpredictable than traditional traffic experts, mainly civil engineers, believe it to be. These models have sparked intense controversy. Other, relatively simple models, which are based on computer simulations rather than differential equations, are winning acceptance for their ability to generate artificial traffic networks that behave like real ones. Researchers have also begun applying their findings in new ways, such as combining simulations with actual traffic data to predict and avert delays. In the next few years, traffic-forecasting systems linked to intelligent highway controls, such as on-ramp metering lights, will become more common, the scientists say.

3f1eeffd7289a55b429891bb7d0bd178faaaf7bc,"Foresight brain science, addiction and drugs project","Sir David King, the Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government, leads the Office of Science and Technology’s Foresight programme. It began in 1994 and the current phase was launched in April 2002. Foresight’s aim is to produce challenging visions of the future to ensure effective strategies now. It does this by providing a core of excellence in science-based futures expertise, and access to leaders in government, science and business. Some of you may be aware of the recent Foresight initiative on Cognitive Systems with its balanced input from computer and brain scientists. An important output of Foresight is to bring together experts from different disciplines so facilitating new collaborative insights and enduring research groupings. The Foresight Brain Science, Addiction and Drugs project reports over the summer of 2005 after a 20-month study that has involved experts from as diverse a range of disciplines as history and economics through to genomics and imaging. Like all Foresight projects, the Brain Science, Addiction and Drugs project has a Stakeholder Group. The group is chaired by Lord Warner, Minister for the Department of Health and has representatives from the Home Office, police, Medical Research Council, Wellcome Trust and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics as well as other organizations that have a great interest in this area. To assist with the development of the project’s scope, Foresight gathered together experts to brainstorm the evolution of their own technologies over the next 20 years. From this, several novel issues relating to addiction emerged such as what will be the place of cognitive enhancers (modafinil and sequelae) in 2025 and to what extent gambling and other forms of behavioural addiction share brain processes with drug and alcohol addiction. In the next stage of the project a series of ‘State-of-Science’ reviews was commissioned. Fifteen of these have been completed covering all elements of brain science, addiction and cognate disciplines – these will be available as 12000-word papers on the Foresight website (www.foresight.gov.uk). They provide an invaluable resource for anyone wishing to easily update their knowledge on the current state of play in addiction and brain sciences related to it. The outputs from these reviews feed into the project’s Horizon Scanning activity where ‘best guesses’ of future trends and achievements are made. This process also involves other relevant knowledge groups such as the pharmaceutical and drinks industries, as well as individual insights into non-drug addictions such as gambling. Finally, the future is explored using scenarios – a process of growing sophistication and robustness that allows a range of different futures to be estimated and explored in the context of current knowledge and possible future technologies. This brings in wider-ranging perspectives such as the effect of changes in political and regulatory attitudes. What are the findings of this Foresight project? These can be found on the website, so I give here a sample of the discussion that is particularly relevant to the readers of the Journal of Psychopharmacology. What will be the state of psychoactive substance use in 2025? This is hard to predict as so many unknowns determine it – ranging from political ideologies through use-fashions and the possible discovery of new drugs. It seems likely that most of the currently abused drugs will still be around, though there may be a few newcomers. Of the few certainties, one is that brain science will continue to grow as a discipline and so we shall have a much better knowledge of the brain mechanisms of addiction and hopefully better approaches to treatment. Especial hope for treatment is given by the rapidly emerging knowledge of the processes of memory which leads to the potential for interventions that help addicts to ‘unlearn’ addiction. However, translating these advances in neuroscience into new therapeutics is potentially difficult and may require a new paradigm in drug regulatory and pricing systems. For instance it may be unclear whether certain drugs would be treated as therapeutic or for enhancement for normal function. The uncertain nature of risk–benefit in the field of drug treatments is also of concern especially in the area of regulating drugs for addiction where the users have higher rates of other illnesses and also usually use other drugs. The possibility that Europe might consider setting up partnerships between the EU and pharmaceutical companies to share the risks in this field may be one way to progress this. Other areas for possible cooperation include facilitating availability of novel compounds into academia. As a footnote it may be worth noting that the BAP has had a significant role in this Foresight programme.

f794956696abce8e09c76dda1a3f29a93196fde4,Hot air or cool heads?,"The advent of Trumpism raises concerns among environmental scientists and resource managers that critical decisions about the global future will be based on political hot air and empty policy rather than good science. The risk is that this will accelerate the rate of climate change and destabilise worldwide efforts to curb emissions negotiated at the Paris COP21 (2015). Significant international agreements that consider needs of both developed and developing countries, and inter-disciplinary efforts to understand social, environmental and economic implications of climate science and adaptation, are now threatened by diplomatic (not just Trump-type physical) walls. In Australia, similar turbulence is evident. Australia’s commitment to the Paris Agreement came into force on 9 September 2016. We are increasingly confronted with severe weather impacts from bushfires and floods, winning records for the hottest or wettest year. Yet, the federal government has reduced its renewable energy targets and is supporting foreign investment in additional coal mining development through public expenditure on infrastructure. This flies in the face of the Productivity Commission’s recommendations that all Australian governments put in place best practice governance arrangements so that decisions about the provision of public infrastructure are ‘undertaken in the public interest, taken to be the wellbeing of the community as a whole’ (PC 2014, p. 39). As we write this editorial, the Federal Court announced that the Australian Conservation Foundation lost its appeal against the lawfulness of government’s approval of Adani’s Carmichael coal mine. This was Australia’s first case to proceed to court arguing against a development based on the fact that burning of coal will have an impact on global warming. It seems that IPCC advice on the urgent need to reduce emissions does not weigh well against the pursuit of more ‘jobs’. Surely stronger reliance on evidence-based policy would produce greater net public benefits. Garnaut (2011) claimed that putting a price on carbon would increase the profitability of investment in innovation and that transforming the electricity sector is at the heart of Australia’s transition to a low-emissions economy. Yet, we have seen direct employment in renewable energy activities in Australia fall from 19,220 full-time jobs in 2009–2010 to 11,150 jobs in 2015–2016, a decrease of 42 per cent (ABS 2017). In spite of this, jurisdictions still strive for more sustainable energy. South Australia aims to deliver battery storage on a grand scale, and the Australian Capital Territory plans a transition to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2020 aided by the country’s largest community-owned solar farm. Many communities and individuals are also doing their bit. It is hard to argue with the cold logic of those close to the ground, who bear the brunt of pollution and extreme weather impacts resulting from unmitigated emissions. But policy alignment among jurisdictions is necessary to facilitate reaching global targets. New Zealand has the inherent advantage of hydropower, which contributes up to 60 per cent of the country’s electricity. With over 80 per cent of electricity currently from renewable sources, a target of 90 per cent by 2025 seems feasible. The increase is expected to be made up by wind power.

4ba28eb99c4d0351a78e346839fb18a0317c78c0,Implications for Undergraduate Education of Two Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences: Biochemistry and Biophysics,"Dear Editor: 
 
As CBE—Life Sciences Education readers know, modern biology has become more quantitative and mechanistic rather than qualitative and phenomenological. Indeed, the American Society for Cell Biology (2010) notes that “biology learning encompasses diverse fields, including math, chemistry, physics, engineering, and computer science, as well as the interdisciplinary intersections of biology with these fields.” Because of this, interdisciplinary biology courses are increasingly critical for preparing undergraduates for further education and careers in the life sciences. The problem is that many institutions do not reflect this in their undergraduate course offerings. In this letter, we show that the growth of two biological disciplines, namely biochemistry and biophysics, can be described in terms of their representation in the research literature. On this basis, we make predictions about the future trends of research in these disciplines and the implications of these trends for undergraduate education. 
 
The most widely taught interdisciplinary biological science is probably biochemistry. Many undergraduate biology and chemistry departments recognize its importance and offer it as a core course in their curricula. Biophysics is another interdisciplinary biological science. Although it is not as popular as biochemistry, the growing importance of the subject should be recognized by teaching institutions and reflected in their course offerings. Unfortunately, it seems that the number of institutions that have noticed the demand for it is limited. For example, out of 34 undergraduate institutions in the University of Georgia System (2010) , only 5 offer an undergraduate biophysics course or related courses, such as physical biochemistry. In contrast, 8 of the top 10 universities listed in U.S. News and World Report (2010) teach biophysics or physical biochemistry. 
 
Here, we offer a brief analysis of the primary life sciences literature to support our argument for widespread teaching of biophysics at the undergraduate level. Specifically, we used the number of papers indexed by PubMed (National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2010 ) as a measure of subject importance. We searched PubMed with search terms “biochemistry OR biochemical” for biochemistry and “biophysics OR biophysical” for biophysics with a limit of the search to title/abstract for each year from 1950 to 2009. We then normalized the number of papers for each subject to the total number of papers in each year. We recognize that there are limitations to this approach. For example, the DNA structure paper by Watson and Crick (1953 ) is not counted as either a biophysics or a biochemistry paper because it does not contain the search terms in its title or abstract. Yet we believe that this metric reasonably represents the activity of the subjects relative to one another. 
 
Figure ​Figure11 shows the normalized number of papers of biochemistry and biophysics, from which we draw three conclusions. First, biochemistry has been continuously growing, with a large increase between 1974 and 1975. This growth may explain why biochemistry is now widely taught. Second, the normalized number of biochemistry publications approaches an asymptotic value suggesting saturation (Figure ​(Figure1A),1A), although we cannot rule out the potential for major transitions in biochemistry research to prompt new growth in the field in the future. Third, although the discipline of biophysics is younger than that of biochemistry, it has been growing exponentially (Figure ​(Figure1B).1B). This feature can be more clearly seen in Figure ​Figure1C,1C, where the number of biophysics papers was normalized to that of the biochemistry papers. Figure ​Figure1C1C indicates that the relative importance of biophysics was ∼12% in year 2009, but if the trend of the last 25 years is maintained for the next 10 years, it will be ∼20% in year 2020. Current biology seems to be facing the same “cultural transition” that chemistry faced ∼100 years ago when it started including physics-based approaches in education and research. This incorporation of physics in chemistry resulted in physical chemistry, one of the core areas in chemistry today (Servos, 1996 ).

Proportion of biochemistry (A) and biophysics (B) papers in PubMed and their ratio ( = biophysics/biochemistry) (C). Extrapolation of the fitting equation is shown as a dashed line (C). Nonlinear curve fitting was performed using SigmaPlot (version 11; ... 
 
 
 
This analysis reveals the major upswing in biochemistry publications that occurred between 1974 and 1975. We offer a hypothesis to explain this phenomenon: the introduction of a great textbook. We propose that Biochemistry by Lehninger (1970) , which has been widely recognized since its initial publication (Sable, 1971 ), is the original modern biochemistry textbook. Perhaps groundbreaking instructional resources such as this can trigger a quantum leap in research in the discipline. Unlike biochemistry, biophysics suffers from the lack of consensus on the standard topics and skills that should comprise an undergraduate course. This is an issue that biologists and biophysicists need to solve together. 
 
In conclusion, if training future biologists is one of the goals of undergraduate biology education, then our analysis indicates that we need to make biophysics a standard component of the curriculum, similar to biochemistry.",CBE - Life Sciences Education,2011.0,13,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1187/cbe.10-09-0124', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3105913, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

For the global climate change target “to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” [1], China needs to peak CO 2 emissions by 2026 at the latest, and action a deep cut in CO 2 emissions [2]. Previous studies on emission scenarios show that it is possible for China to peak CO 2 emissions by 2030 if strong policies are adopted, but with a relatively high cost. Peaking CO 2 emissions before 2025 is therefore a very big challenge for China. A modeling study by IPAC on the 2°C target suggests that it is still possible for China to reach peak CO 2 emissions before 2025, but several preconditions are needed, including optimizing economic development, further energy-efficiency improvements, enhanced renewable energy and nuclear development, and CCS [2]. The rapid increase in energy-intensive product output in the last several years is a major driving force for fast energy demand growth. Energy-intensive industry accounts for more than 50% of the energy use in China, and for more than 70% of newly increased power output [3]. Further growth trends in energy-intensive industry are a key factor for energy and CO 2 emissions in China. The development of energy-intensive industry should, therefore, be limited. The quick change in the pattern of economic development means a much higher social energy conservation rate. Scenario ana lysis shows many energy-intensive products outputs will reach peaks before 2020, with a much slower growth rate compared with that in the 11th Five-Year Plan and, therefore, will significantly change the pathway for energy demand and CO 2 emissions [4]. This would happen either through positive policy action to optimize economy structure change, or passively by market oversupply; China’s output of many raw materials and final consumption goods are approximately half of global output. The rate of infrastructure increase is large enough to support economic development and residential demand in China, despite high GDP growth rate, income increase rate and urbanization rate. Exports were one of the major driving forces for energy increase; however, the large share of Chinese products in the global output shows limited space for further increases of the share [5]. Energy efficiency should be further promoted.

In order to promote the professional quality and practice ability of electrical engineering and its automation for teachers in higher education institutions, they cultivate excellent engineer, understand the latest education teaching trends, and improve the education teaching ability. Under the background of outstanding engineers, this paper introduces the practice on the training mode, the aim, the curriculum system, the teaching model, the teachers and the other aspects. In order to adapt to the comprehensive quality and practical ability which enterprises require, the ministry of education proposed ""outstanding engineers training plan"" in 2010. Excellence program is based on “National medium and longterm education reform and development plan outline (20102020)”and “National medium and long-term talent development plan (2010-2020)”, and it is a teaching innovation project for engineering discipline. Electrical engineering and its automation is the third group to open ""outstanding engineers’ class” which ministry of education approved. Keywords-excellence; formatting; curriculum; styling; insert (key words) I. THE ORIGINAL CURRICULUM SYSTEM AND THE PROBLEMS EXISTING IN THE TRAINING MODES. A. The curriculum focuses on the theory, and pays the limited attention to the experiment and practice. The courses divide into basic course, professional basic course and specialized course curriculum. Theory courses include Advanced Mathematics, Probability and Mathematical Statistics, Complex Function, University Physics, Physics Experiment, Basics of Computer Application, Programming Language, Microcomputer Principle and so on. Professional basic courses include Circuit Analysis, Analysis of Circuits Experiment, Digital Electronic Technique, Analog Electronics Technique, Electromechanics, Principle of Automatic Control, Signals and Systems, Electronic Technology, Electrical Measurements, Electric Power Engineering and so on. Above of courses, only Physical Experiment and Circuit Analysis Experiment are separate experiments, the other experiment courses are opened in class. Less course exercises, engineering practice and comprehensive practice training are provided. There is a problem about focusing on teaching and theory, underestimating application and practice. B. Teaching methods are not flexible enough. Theory teaching of teachers is close to the traditional teaching method, there is a lot of cramming system in the International Conference on Education, Management, Computer and Society (EMCS 2016) © 2016. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 1138 teaching process. In class, teachers often teach more, students participate in discussions and communication less. Therefore, the classroom atmosphere is depressing and unfavorable to arouse the enthusiasm of students. The single teaching method limits the students‟ way of thinking and their innovative ability. C. Training mode has no advantage to cultivate applied talents in 4 years of university. While in this four years, university also opened a experiment for students to simulate the scene, and at the end of each year also arranged for a certain time to enterprise practice. Students can understand the theory and enterprise site better in these experiments and internships. After all, it is a limited time to practice in the enterprise, and it is not really working in the enterprise. Companies don't really make internship students operate something. Students may observe more and operate less. Most importantly, not really working in the enterprise can't be realized the environment. D. Less considering that the students experience sciencehumanities division in high school. Students whose major is electrical engineering and its automation are all science students, so they are short of literacy. In stage 4 years study in university, less of the humanities and social sciences courses, just like Management and Finance, can be arranged except ideology and politics courses. It is unfavorable to cultivate engineering and technical students. E. The practice and the international quality of teachers needs to be improved. Almost all the teachers in the university are academics, they come from college to college, and they don’t have enterprises working experience and practical experience. So it is very difficult for the teachers who don’t have a lot of practical experience to combine theory with practice. In the teachers, few of them return from abroad, proportion of the teachers who have overseas experience is also very small. It is hardly conducive to outstanding internationalization requirements of the plan in such conditions. II. TRAINING GOALS OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND ITS AUTOMATION UNDER THE BACKGROUND OF EXCELLENCE ENGINEERS Excellence engineers plan is a kind of teaching reform constitutionally, it is a comprehensive reform for teaching of education major, and it is also a operational systems engineering. On one hand, it involves the reform of the current training scheme, training mode, course system, teaching model, teaching method and so on. On the other hand, it refers to the reform of faculty. Two aspects of reform conduct at the same time, it can achieve the goal to cultivate applied and innovative talents. This major needs to cultivate the students who satisfy the needs of the development of modern science and technology and economic construction. They have a sound personality, good humanistic attainment and moral cultivation, they own the broad natural science foundation, strong electrical engineering foundation and professional skills. They are rich in innovative spirit and strong ability in engineering practice. They can show their strong communication and team cooperation ability. They can work on engineering design, system analysis, information processing, scientific experiment, research and development, economy or science and technology management in the area of electrical engineering or related major, just like system operation, automatic control, industrial process control, electric system, electric machines and electric apparatus, power electronic technology, detection and automation instrument, electronics and computer application. Cultivating goal can summarize as the following five items: 1) They must have the sound personality, the good humanistic attainment and moral cultivation. 2) They need to have the broad natural science foundation, the strong foundation of electrical engineering and professional skills. 3) They own the innovative spirit, the strong ability in engineering practice. 4) They have the strong communication and the team cooperation ability. 5) Be qualified for technology and economic management position in the field of electric engineering. The training requirements show as follows: 1) Knowledge: Grasp the broad natural science foundation, master theoretical knowledge, just like Circuit Theory, Principle of Electromagnetic Field, Analog and Digital Electronic Technology, Principle of Automatic control, Fundamentals of Computer Technology, Signal Analysis and Processing. 2) Capability requirement: Grasp the method of the analysis and experiments of system and equipment, the basic ways of science and technology development and engineering design. Have the ability of analyzing, designing, developing about electronic information and electrical engineering. 3) Engineering requirements: Receive the basic training of circuit technique, electronic technique, application of computer technology and network, scientific research and engineering design. Understand the guidelines, policies, laws and regulations of the country about production, design, research and development, environmental protection in the field of electrical engineering and its automatization specialty. III. TEACHING REFORM OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND ITS AUTOMATION UNDER THE BACKGROUND OF EXCELLENCE ENGINEERS A. Optimize the curriculum system and strengthen courses integration Curriculum system is the baton of teaching. The traditional electrical engineering education in colleges and universities has the problem about inconsistent curriculum structure, being lack of cohesion between courses. These problems make the students have no professional knowledge system. But if you want to pass the exam of register electrical engineer, you must have strong professional and comprehensive abilities. In order to adapt the requirement of the registered electrical engineer, electrical engineering curriculum system of college should",,2016.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.atlantis-press.com/article/25848816.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2991/EMCS-16.2016.280?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2991/EMCS-16.2016.280, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9f7935aae3aca09f0672a50e2ba0b3aceb444a0f,Research on Development of Integrated Digital Teaching Platform in Civil Engineering in Higher Vocational Colleges,"In the teaching practice of civil engineering, the Binzhou Polytechnic adheres to the principle of “deriving from school, and serving for the school”. It has exploited teaching resources by using BIM technology all at once, built a “3+3” teaching system consisted of “three-stage teaching” and “three-level teaching platform” taking physical buildings on campus as a carrier, shared teaching resources by means of mobile Internet technology to make the teaching reform of civil engineering in higher vocational colleges. 1. Research background Building Information Modeling (BIM), is a three-dimensional architecture model based on all information data in the constructional engineering project to stimulate all real information of the architecture virtually by digital information. In August 2016, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China issued the Outline of informatization development of construction industry 2016-2020, proposed that it is necessary to promote the popularization of BIM application, and advance the “Internet Plus” cooperative working model. And currently, the “Internet+BIM” technology has become a hotspot in the construction industry. More than 10 higher vocational colleges in Shandong has opened the BIM modeling curriculums, and BIM games and certification tests are held regularly each year in the province dominated by modeling. In the construction of IT teaching platform in colleges, inconvenient resource access often causes low rate of usage, and the teaching platform provided by professional 3D stimulation development companies also has some defects, for example, teachers cannot upgrade or maintain the resources in the model independently. BIM technology boasts imitativeness, visualization, which can be integrated with IT teaching building of schools. The “Internet+BIM” technology can not only upgrade the teaching resources, but transform the teaching management method as well as the assessment criterion of students. 2. Research objectives 2.1 Deriving from school and serving for school The author has selected three typical buildings on campus, and constructed a comprehensive integrated digital teaching platform modeling with Revit of BIM software and working drawing, construction organization design, settlement data, photos and videos in practical construction. The integration of teaching resources is conducive to classroom teaching and the self-learning after class. In the process, students can enter the buildings, combine physical buildings with 2D drawings and 3D models, learn deeply by accessing teaching resources via computers and tablet computers. The integrated digital teaching platform not only serves for teaching, but realizes virtual exhibition of campus environment utilizing the advantages of BIM technology. Students, thus, can know campus building environment, repair and maintenance of electromechanical pipelines of campus building and smart campus by virtual tour, and teachers can access resources to take part in IT teaching skills contest, Micro-course contest, guide the technical innovation projects of college students. 339 Copyright © 2018, the Authors.

9920e2232c80661b82b10bd81bba81e59cbc1955,Research on Improving the Informatization Teaching Ability of Civil Engineering Teachers in BIM Environment,"With the rapid development of information technology, the degree of informatization in the construction industry has also been greatly improved. Particularly, the development of BIM technology and assembly construction technology as well as the development of green building leads to the upgrading of the construction industry. This requires teachers to master the information products of the new era to be qualified for the teaching work. Based on the principle of "" post ability, teacher first "", this paper puts forward a spiral-upgrading teacher's ability upgrading plan to deal with the transformation and upgrading of construction industry. Teachers' ability is promoted through teacher training, enterprise training and building network learning platform. In March 2016, the ""two sessions"" and the Fourth Session of the Twelfth National People's Congress were held. The meeting adopted the “13th Five-year” plan for economic and social development. The plan clearly puts forward that talent training in vocational education should be based on enhancing morality and respecting teacher education. We should carry out professional layout and industrial needs docking, curriculum content and professional standards docking, teaching process docking with production process, graduation certificate and vocational qualification certificate docking, vocational education and lifelong learning docking. The establishment of BIM building information model is a revolution in the field of architecture and it will become a powerful tool for project management. The mastery of BIM technology can help us develop better in the construction industry. The construction of green building is the mission of every practitioner, and it is also the responsibility of the construction industry. On November 14, 2015, the Ministry of Housing and Construction issued the “Outline for the Modernization of the Construction Industry”. It is planned that by 2020, the percentage of prefabricated buildings will account for more than 20% of the newly-built buildings, and by 2025, prefabricated buildings will account for more than 50% of the new buildings. The birth of new technology in the construction industry has caused the upgrading of the construction industry and brought new opportunities and challenges for teachers of the construction industry. At the same time, it also puts forward new requirements for the professional teachers in the construction industry in the new knowledge and new skills. And requires teachers to grasp the information products in order to be competent for teaching. Since 2010, our research group has investigated the mastery of new knowledge and skills for professional teachers in higher vocational colleges. The investigation found that teachers know that the upgrading of the construction industry is not comprehensive and unsystematic, and their practice ability of the new technology is not very good. It is urgent to improve the ability of professional teachers of civil engineering in higher vocational colleges to form a systematic implementation plan. 1. Construction ideas It is very important to carry out the national and provincial document spirit,which is related to the development of vocational education and the development of teachers. The demand for teaching is taken as a guide. The improvement of the quality of teachers' double quality, the training of all 588 Copyright © 2018, the Authors. Published by Atlantis Press.

d75a5198657da15495d50bae9e10b6e2220ca19b,Abstract A14: Digital health information access among Asian Americans,"Background Access to health information is essential to patient-centered healthcare. Healthy People 2020 recommended three key strategies for improving health outcomes and narrowing health disparities. One of the key strategies is to provide equitable access to health information. Digital technology holds great promise in helping to reduce health disparities. In fact, recent studies indicate that the “digital divide” is narrowing between racial/ethnic minorities and the general population. The question remains, however, on whether or not all groups have equal access to digital health information. Asian Americans (AAs) are the fastest growing minority group in the U.S. More than 65% of AAs are foreign-born, and greater than 30% have limited English proficiency. Non-English speaking AAs were not specifically targeted in previous digital technology ownership and usage surveys. However, such information is important to ensure equal access to digital cancer control information and other health information. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine (1) the most common channels that AA immigrants use to obtain health information, and (2) factors predicting the ownership and usage of computers, as well as the use of the Internet to obtain health information. Methods This study used a cross-sectional design and quota sampling. Participants were recruited through seven community-based organizations and from six Asian subgroups (Cambodian, Chinese, Filipinos, Korean, Laotian, South Asians and Vietnamese) . Participants were asked where they usually received helpful health information. They were also asked whether they had a computer at home and knew how to use it, as well as whether they used the Internet to obtain health information. Surveys were conducted in participants9 native language. Only data from participants who were foreign-born were used in the statistical analysis. Results 403 participants completed the survey and 395 (98%) were foreign-born. 49% had family income $20,000/year (p $20,000/year (p Conclusion Despite a narrowing racial/ethnic “digital divide”, disparities still exist, particularly among Asian immigrants with low social economic status, less years of education and limited English proficiency. New interventions are needed to target underserved AA subpopulations and help them to gain access to digital health information and develop information seeking skills.

69883b362c4007521ed9ea0f6acd31b3c820f299,Editorial,"This first issue in Volume 27 of the Australasian Journal of Engineering Education presents five papers, and a heartfelt piece in memoriam of Lyndal Parker who will be deeply missed by members of the Australasian Association for Engineering Education. Authors contribute to understanding how to teach online, how to enhance work placement experiences, how to develop multidisciplinary capabilities, and how to teach school students science concepts that they will need for engineering education. Universities have now been adapting to COVID-19 for 2 years. The Australasian Association for Engineering Education Conference 2020 in Sydney was themed ‘Disruptions in Engineering Education’. The first two papers in this issue are aligned with this theme and will be valuable to educators considering online teaching and learning, and guiding transitions in the mode of curriculum delivery. We have learned much about online delivery. Although health risks due to the virus persist, educators are designing future curricula taking advantage of expanded capability to teach and learn online, and evidence of success of teaching and learning remotely. Caldera, Desha, and Dawes (2022) in ‘Applying Cynefin framework to explore the experiences of engineering educators undertaking “emergency remote teaching” during the COVID-19 pandemic’ interviewed six engineering educators about the transition to emergency remote teaching. The results reveal opportunities for readers interested in increasing the numbers of students studying engineering. Valentine, Belski, and Hamilton (2022) in ‘Influence of using a pen-and-paper or computer-based approach on engineering students’ self-efficacy during idea generation’ tested paper-based and online modules designed to enhance students’ creativity, and report that students’ idea generation and self-efficacy were as strong for the students who completed the learning activities online as for those who used pen and paper. The Australasian Journal of Engineering Education publishes research that informs development across the lifespan of an engineer. Ladachart, Chaimongkol, and Phothong (2022) in ‘Design-based learning to facilitate secondary students’ understanding of pulleys’ demonstrate efficacy of their approach with 25 eighth-grade students. Ngonda, Shaw, and Kloot (2022) in ‘The pitfalls of work placement learning: perceptions of mechanical engineering students from a South African university’ report studying the work placement experiences of 34 students. Ngonda and co-authors’ findings about the importance of the allocated responsibilities, quality of supervision, and attributes of students, and the authors’ recommendations to enhance students’ and supervisors’ preparation for placements, are consistent with the international literature on work integrated learning. Irvine et al. (2022) in ‘A multidisciplinary approach to authentic learning experiences for nature-based solutions design: broadening the monkey cheeks’ share their experience of multidisciplinary designbased engineering education involving landscape architecture and environmental engineering students. The capabilities for multidisciplinary practice are developed in too few engineering programmes. This paper will be inspiring and informative for educators rising to the challenge of designing and implementing multidisciplinary learning activities for students.

58b55eb3154c7f9e7909917fb4acc139a45b86a8,Why Girls with an Interest in IT in High School Do Not Choose IT Careers – An Extended Study,"The study attempts to investigate the reason of why girls with an interest in IT in highschool do not choose career in IT. Here we present qualitative results from the focus group interview. The focus group consisted of eight young women, who were actively involved in extra curriculum education in IT area during their final years at school, but have chosen different profession after. As a result of the interview we have identified the following factors influencing respondents’ decision for not choosing career in IT: selfperceived lack of aptitude to succeed in IT, unwillingness to deal with numbers, selfperceived insufficient knowledge for admission for IT degree, parental influence, stereotypes of IT profession, unattractive image of IT specialist, uninteresting subjects of the IT program. Finally we have suggested actions. Introduction There is a great need for IT specialists in the world in general and in Russia in particular. By 2020, Russia plans to employ at least 600,000 IT specialists. At the same time, existing Russian universities graduate only about 25,000 students in the IT profession every year and are not able to quadruple the capacity at once. It became clear that Russia needs a new effective university specifically dedicated to education in the IT area. In 2012 the first Russian IT university – Innopolis University – was established near Kazan. The university will become the heart of an innovation city – Innopolis City – which aims at providing high-quality living and working conditions for 150,000 people, a special economic zone for existing IT businesses and a supportive environment for new IT start-ups. Innopolis University will be a key source of highly-qualified IT specialists for Innopolis City and for Russia. It is quite a challenging mission. In order to achieve the goal the University has to attract the best candidates across the country. The difficulty is that approximately 90% of the high-school graduates in Russia are already admitted to established universities. Therefore, in order to populate the new University we need to attract applicants from other professions. For example, one should be able to convince students applying for a degree in economics, physics or mathematics to apply for an IT specialty since the requirements are very similar. Another alternative could be to reach out to the students interested in linguistics, logic or art and encourage them to pursue a career in IT. However, in this paper we propose yet another potential source for future IT specialists – women. Background A. Previouse findings In the fall of 2013 Innopolis University conducted an extensive survey of groups of stakeholders on what competencies they consider important for IT specialists. More than 900 respondents participated in the survey. The groups of stakeholders included highschool students with an explicit interest in IT, students of IT specialties, IT professionals, top management of IT companies, and owners of IT businesses. By “explicit interest” in IT we mean that high-school students attend extra-curricular classes in IT (often for extra fees), for example, in programming, web and virtual design, robotics, etc. It was discovered among respondents over 18 years old, which represents students of IT specialties and IT professionals of all kinds, the fraction of respondents who are female is about 10% and quite stable across the range from 18 to 45. Among high-school students the fraction of girls with an explicit interest in IT is over 30%, see Figure 1. This finding implies that women, who chose IT as a specialty at the University stay in the profession. However, although many girls demonstrate an interest in IT area they do not choose a career in IT. Why and where have all the girls gone? Figure 1. Distribution of women in IT by age group. The plot at Figure 1 is just a snapshot for one year of the survey. For rigorous analysis one should conduct such survey for several year to prove the pattern. Unfortunately we don’t have such option in hand and have to rely on side indicators to justify our assumption. Firstly, we checked statistics on high-school girls taking extra-curriculum classes in IT in our partner institution Unium. This is a biggest player on a marked of extra-curriculum education in Russia. However, it is just one of many. We have an access to data since 2006. In the last 7 years the percentage of girls in IT classes gradually decayed from 24% to 19%. From this fact we may formulate an assumption: total percentage of young women interested in IT back in 2006 was at least as high as our observation on 2013. Secondly, we refer to reported data from the Computing Research Association, where it is indicated that fewer than 12% of Computer Science BS degrees were awarded to women at US institutions in 2010-11. This number matches our findings at the age group 23-26 (usual age for obtaining university degree). Another reference source is data collected by Google on percentage of female engineers in 84 IT companies. The report indicates 12.33% on average, which again resonates with our data. These facts support our assumption that the discovered pattern is representative for several years. The	  detected	  behavior	  is	  more	  typical	  for	  Russian	  or	  broader	  Western	  European education	  system,	  where	  students	  chooses	  the	  path	  just	  before	  entering	  the university	  and	  not	  before	  high-­‐school	  level10. B. Overview of current study The study is focused on the follow-up survey of high-school girls who took extra classes in programming and programming related subjects. A large private Russian company Unium, specializing in extracurricular pre-university education has provided us with the data, which have been collected over 8 years. We identified the girls, who took classes in programming in addition to their school program and followed up with them to investigate whether they entered university for IT specialty and/or work in IT at the moment. Those women who have not chosen a career in IT were invited to participate in a focus group for one-to-one interviews, where young women reflected on the reasons behind their decision not to continue in IT. Here we present qualitative results of the survey. 31 10	   11	   8	   3	   10	   0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 under	  18	   18-­‐22	   23-­‐26	   27-­‐29	   30-­‐35	   36-­‐45	   46-­‐60 % W om en in IT Age	  group Percent	  of	  women	  in	  IT	  by	  agegroup Methodology For the follow up survey we utilized the database of clients who enrolled in extracurricular courses in IT from Unium. We have been provided with data going back to 2007. From the broad range of educational courses offered by Unium we have focused only on those that are IT-related, namely: Web-design, computer flash graphics, and programming in C/C++. We limited the selection pool to over 900 pupils satisfying those criteria, including 142 girls. We aimed to form a group of 8-10 young women for a focus group interview. To achieve this we first designed a questionnaire to be used for an effective phone-survey for the initial identification of the young woman who did not choose to continue in IT. We then contacted over 100 of them by phone. During the process we faced the following challenges: • The contact information was outdated. • The participant was not willing to participate in the survey. • The participant was not willing or able to attend the focus group interview. We also aimed to have a diverse group for interviews, not just participants of Unium courses. In order to do so we engaged a professional marketing agency with many client contacts, including those in the pre-university education area. The agency provided us with contacts of several young women who satisfied the criteria but were taking extracurricular IT courses with other companies (all courses require a fee). The final focus group consisted of 8 girls: 4 graduates from Unium and 4 from other educational centers. The interview with the focus group lasted for over 2 hours and was conducted by a professional interviewer provided by the marketing agency we engaged. The guide for the interview was designed in the following way: • Confirmation of prior education in IT. • Current occupation. • Identification of the reasons not to continue studying/working in IT. The English version of the interview guide is provided in Appendix I. The interview was video and audio recorded. The audio record has been subsequently transcribed and translated to English. In order to ensure trustworthiness of the respondents, they were not informed about the goal of the interview. Instead they were invited for a talk as part of the marketing survey to speak about their experience during taking extra-curriculum classes. The interviewer gradually shifted topic of the discussion to career choice and reasoning behind not choosing career in IT. Results and Analysis Participants of the focus group interview*: Young woman A, 19, studies restaurant business administration and works parttime at the restaurant Young woman B, 19, studies literature Young woman C, 23, studies economics Young woman D, 22, studies food technology Young woman E, 20, studies art Young woman F, 23, graduated with a degree in linguistics, works as an English/Spanish interpreter Young woman G, 23, graduated with a degree in tourism administration, works in a travel company Young woman H, 20, studies geography Below we present the qualitative results of the survey. A. Initial interest in IT All young women who participated in the focus group interview demonstrated clear interest in IT during school period. When asked about the source of that interest the participants provided the following answers: 1) Inclination towards IT Many respondents referred to passion for computers since the early childhood: “Since the moment I started sitting at a computer, I got interested.” 2) Keeping up with tec",,2015.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.18260/p.25074', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/p.25074?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/p.25074, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b8f42e5cc012bc02d5eed909cc0e24bbae5eeb50,Transformation of a Large Civil Engineering Department Curriculum using the ASCE BOK2,"Texas A&M’s undergraduate civil engineering curriculum has been re-designed and founded on the 2nd edition of ASCE’s Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge (BOK2). The curriculum transformation work involved a team of civil engineering faculty and students as well as a pedagogical expert and occurred over a deliberate two year timeframe. The process was made explicitly analogous to an engineering design process with data-driven analysis in order to build faculty consensus. The team adapted the BOK2 outcome statements and defined comprehensive rubrics to specify expectations of student performance for multiple indicators under each outcome at multiple levels in the curriculum. A curriculum map was then developed to identify how specific courses would introduce, reinforce, and demonstrate program outcomes as students advanced. The size of the program (in terms of available elective plans as well as personnel) required enhanced attention to potential student course plans, empowerment of course coordinators, and inclusion of representative stakeholders. Beyond the expected work of revising courses, the effort led to: a novel mid-curriculum zero credit hour course incorporating a highimpact learning practice and reflection, extensive cooperation with external departments to enhance non-departmental courses, and cataloging of resources for students to address knowledge gaps between courses. Lessons learned focus on how the expansive nature of the BOK2 outcomes require a process that values deliberation, inclusion, and creativity. Introduction The civil engineering department at Texas A&M University (approximately 1000 undergraduate students and 60 faculty) decided to undertake a curriculum transformation project based on concerns of conceptual gaps and redundancies in the degree program and the significant time that had elapsed since the last comprehensive curriculum restructuring. This curriculum redesign was noteworthy because it was among the first to incorporate the outcomes from ASCE’s Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge for the 21st Century: Preparing the Civil Engineer for the Future, 2nd Edition (BOK2)1. Other efforts to incorporate the BOK2 holistically into curricula have been documented at the Universities of Alabama, Arkansas, and Texas-Tyler2 and Lawrence Technological University3, with BOK2-driven curriculum analysis and change proposals discussed at Rose Hulman Institute of Technology4, Montana State University5, University of Louisiana6, Northern Arizona University7, and North Carolina State University8. The curriculum transformation process has many goals, three of which will be explained in this paper: 1. Redesign the civil engineering curriculum of a large research university using the ASCE BOK2 as a basis. P ge 26599.3 2. Develop program learning outcome rubrics for each BOK outcome using pedagogical resources (ABET webinar, AAC&U rubrics, etc.) and a rigorous editing process. 3. Create a curriculum map based on program learning outcome rubrics and survey data. Use program learning outcome rubrics and curriculum map to design or revise individual courses. This paper discusses the motivation behind using the ASCE Body of Knowledge 2 outcomes as program learning outcomes, the process used to facilitate the curriculum transformation, and best practices for creating and refining program learning outcome rubrics and a curriculum map. It also presents draft versions of the program learning outcome rubrics and curriculum map. Curriculum Transformation Process A curriculum transformation team (CTT), consisting of 13 civil engineering faculty, 3 students, a pedagogical expert, and a graduate assistant, was formed to re-evaluate the civil engineering curriculum and recommend changes that could make the program more relevant to the needs of today’s engineers while addressing the gaps and redundancies in the current curriculum. The pedagogical expert was key because she provided a curriculum redesign process for the team to follow that was adapted from existing models9, 10 and the process is outlined in detail in a separate paper11. The process began with identifying the need for a curriculum redesign and gathering data on the program’s strengths and weaknesses11. The next step was to identify the attributes that an ideal graduate of the program would have. These ideal attributes were articulated through program learning outcomes and through rubrics that define each program learning outcome in terms of measurable performance indicators. The program learning outcomes and rubrics were used to create a curriculum map that identifies the level at which courses will incorporate each of the program learning outcomes. Courses can be linked to a program learning outcome at the progressive levels of “Introduce,” “Reinforce,” or “Demonstrate.” As a final step, individual courses were designed or revised to incorporate the program learning outcomes at the level identified on the curriculum map. An important component of this final stage is to ensure that students learn the desired outcomes by designing assessment measures that are closely linked to both course and program learning outcomes. The BOK and motivation... In January 2004, the American Society of Civil Engineers published the first version of the Body of Knowledge in accordance with ASCE Policy Statement 465, which was originally created in 1998 and calls for attainment of a body of knowledge as a prerequisite to professional licensure. Since then, ASCE has released a second version of the BOK (ASCE Body of Knowledge Committee 2008, hereafter “BOK2”) that more accurately accounts for “stakeholder input and P ge 26599.4 recent developments in engineering education and practice” [BOK2, p.2]. Many of the driving factors for changes to the BOK are articulated in “The Vision for Civil Engineering 2025”12 and in NAE “Engineer of 2020” reports13. These driving factors focus on the quickly-changing, global engineering landscape, with examples such as the increasing need for lifelong and selfdirected learning, trends towards sustainability, and emphasis on professional skills in addition to technical knowledge. The civil engineering department at Texas A&M decided to incorporate the BOK2 outcomes into the undergraduate curriculum because, unlike the program’s existing ABET-based outcomes, the BOK2 outcomes are more focused toward civil engineers and are accompanied by Appendices with detailed descriptions of each outcome. When the Body of Knowledge document was first shared with the CTT, there was significant pushback from team members that did not understand the value of reading such a long document and were hesitant to adopt 24 outcomes in place of the 12 existing program outcomes. Several measures were taken to encourage CTT members to accept the BOK2 outcomes, but there were still some members who did not see the benefit of these outcomes until the curriculum mapping phase. The first measure taken was to refocus efforts from course-level details to the big picture of the curriculum as a whole. This was accomplished by comparing the curriculum redesign process to a civil engineering design process, wherein both are iterative and require background information as inputs to a conceptual design that is then used to guide the final design. In this analogy, reviewing the BOK2 and other sources of data corresponds to the background information stage, program learning outcomes and associated rubrics are the conceptual design, and the curriculum map and individual course design are performed in the final design stage. This analogy was presented graphically in a separate paper11, and can be found at https://sites.google.com/site/cttgraphic/. The second measure taken to encourage civil engineering faculty to consider the BOK2 was mapping the program’s existing outcomes, the required ABET outcomes, and the 24 BOK2 outcomes, as shown in Figure 1. This document helped to illustrate that the BOK2 outcomes were not significantly different from ABET requirements. In most cases, additional BOK2 outcomes were created by splitting long, compounded ABET outcomes into separate pieces. For example, ABET outcome (a), “an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering”, is addressed by four outcomes in the BOK2: (1) Mathematics, (2) Natural Sciences, (5) Material Sciences, and (6) Mechanics. By separating one outcome into four, it is easier to assess each area within “math, science, and engineering” individually; therefore, in many cases, the BOK2 does not add additional requirements, but instead adds detail and specificity. There are, however, a few instances, (13) Project Management, (22) Attitudes, (12) Risk/Uncertainty, and (15) Technical Specialization, of outcomes that were included in the BOK2 due to input from civil engineering stakeholders and represent areas that were not P ge 26599.5 explicitly addressed in the ABET requirements. This mapping was largely done in the BOK2 report [Appendix H and p. 101] -there to compare ABET, BOK1, and BOK2 -but the CTT’s step of explicitly modifying that work to include the specific program’s curriculum was crucial. Other authors have discussed the tension between an increased number of program-level outcomes in the BOK2 and constrained or decreasing numbers of credit hours in baccalaureate engineering degrees2, especially if faculty view new outcomes as being “practitioner-driven” from a viewpoint of the B.S. degree of 30 years ago with more available credit hours. In the case of Texas A&M’s effort, this tension was managed in two ways. First, surveys were conducted to determine perceptions for each of the 24 BOK2 outcomes of comparative importance and preparedness of new graduates. The surveys were given to separate populations of recent graduates (less than 5 years after graduation) and industry employers (typically 20-30 years after graduation). Survey results from the two populations were very similar across the outcomes",,2015.0,5,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.18260/p.24935', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/p.24935?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/p.24935, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2fe5dd3e1f96cd263ae5e21b968d1efbef3ae944,Integrated 3D Multimedia Web Based Application in Biology: A Prototype,"Since the middle of 1990s, Malaysia has already showed its commitment and emphasis on the idea of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) is being developed in order to satisfy the country's ambition to achieve the fully developed status by the year 2020. Recent studies showed that online learning for secondary students had become more established and accepted as a standard way of learning nowadays. Educators are always being encouraged to incorporate technology into their classroom teaching. 3D interactions with multimedia elements relatively allow the learners to learn and grasp the lessons being taught much faster than in a normal classroom. The use of computer training tools where the student can interact with a computer model can give good feedbacks. 3D analytical approach is especially useful in determining the fundamental molecular events using a Web-based, visually-oriented system that allows efficient querying of gene expression. The implementation of VRML is perceivably efficient and effective method for conveying molecular models over the net. In molecular science, 3D impressions and conceptions are elementary in order to transfer and understand further complex structural information. A prototype of an interactive 3D multimedia learning tool in Biology was created in order to provide users with a 3D element multimedia study environment in Biology subject. The prototype contains three main divisions which are the 3DiC, animations and tutorials.

9c808b3ba0d19ab3e288c1b08a1b8e96ae6c01d8,Work in Progress: FLEx—Iowa State University’s Mobile Technology Classroom,"This proposal describes the FLEx (Forward Learning Experience) program, a mobile learning environment in a 16-foot trailer designed to deliver advanced technology outreach to students around the state of Iowa. A joint effort of Iowa State University’s College of Design, College of Engineering, and Extension and Outreach, the FLEx has engaged 35,000 K-12 students, educators, and families in 171 events since the fall of 2014. The trailer provides hands-on experiences with virtual reality, immersive visualization, prototyping, augmented reality through an Oculus Rift, interactive circuit building, a Makerbot for 3D printing, and a CNC (computer numerical control) router for complex precision material cutting. The FLEx utilizes learning theories such as constructivist, experiential and situational learning, universal design and game theory, and supports tinkering, play, and self-directed exploration. An early informal program review showed that Design and STEM interest among grades 3-8 increased 72% due to exposure to the FLEx. The FLEx is a groundbreaking program which improves a land-grant university’s potential to reach its state constituents in a novel and focused manner. The program has received national awards, recognition, and interest in its early and initial configuration. Future work will partner with University Extension and 4-H to build capacity to increase exposure and provide this experience to many more students across the state, with a particular focus on supporting rural students and underserved communities. Research is ongoing and being formally proposed to show the educational benefits of the program through workshops and longterm positive outcomes in partnership with state-level educational task forces. Introduction The Forward Learning Experience (FLEx) program is a mobile learning environment for advanced design technology outreach at Iowa State University. The first prototype was created as part of an Industrial Design graduate studio in the summer of 2014. The ideas combined universal concepts about design and design thinking, learning theories for informal environments, concepts about problem solving, Makerspaces, the Internet of Things (IoT), STEM and STEAM. The small studio of nine graduate students and one instructor worked on these aspects, looked to the Iowa Core1 for educational connections, and incorporated 21st Century Skills and the Universal Constructs (4 C’s) into the design. Deeper researching and ideating recognized major differences between 20th Century approaches to education and new opportunities for learning and solving problems. Today, digital technology is pervasive with mobile devices and the internet providing an abundance of information, knowledge and opportunity. According to Richardson2, by 2020 more than half the US workforce will be “freelancers, consultants and independent workers.” This lines up with today’s workforce trends where many individuals work multiple part-time jobs. Richardson also notes a shift in students needing to master content to being able to master learning. This aligns with a base concept Brown3 has put forward describing, “agency” as active participation, creating and building. A 21st century strategy for learning by design encourages agency with each individual actively experiencing new technologies tools for creating and communicating in a combination that supports deeper experiential learning. Equipment Two types of experiences and tools emerged from the development of this project, which overlap in concept but actively engage the participants individually and directly. The two types of experiences and tools encompass the ideas of “SEE” and “MAKE”. These focal points have also been described as “visualization” and “fabrication” in the Industrial Design Department at Iowa State, and the two parallel the ideas of “digital prototyping” and “real prototyping,” which is also part of iterative thinking in design and STEM. Table 1Inventory of FLEx equipment The SEE module primarily involves two sets of virtual reality headsets. One presents a serene Italian Tuscany Villa Oculus Rift demo, where orientation and navigation in a virtual world is self-directed and non-threatening. A keyboard and mouse augment the headset for movement and orientation around the space in a manner very similar to computer games such as Minecraft with the interface remaining very simple and unobtrusive. The Villa, highly textured and realistic, creates an easy opportunity for being introduced to virtual reality. The second headset is programmed with a custom virtual roller coaster on central campus at Iowa State a familiar setting to many Iowa residents. This ride requires only the headset and provides a very visceral virtual reality experience with the roller coaster rushing between and through buildings and careening up, down, and around central campus. This is often a highlight experience of the FLEx, as the feeling of being there is heightened by the perceived action of the roller coaster. The SEE module is also an opportunity to present smartphone virtual reality like Google Cardboard or augmented reality experiences through tablets, which are more easily replicated at schools or homes due to the lower cost of entry. Figure 1 Student reaction to the Oculus Rift headset The MAKE module realizes a more physical space of interaction with a small 3D fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive printer. Previously completed 3D prints (such as Pikachu or Iowa State’s campanile) serve as examples, and a real-time 3D print with the printing software and digital model resources are displayed. Videos showing a variety of current real-world and authentic 3D printing solutions such as buildings, chocolate, medicine, prosthetics, circuits, car chassis, and biological matter are also shown, and these examples let the technology demonstrate tangible opportunities to FLEx participants. Additionally, the MAKE module offers hands-on, creative modular circuit building. Little Bits are color-coded modules that magnetically snap together for straightforward assembly, manipulation, and experimentation. These electronic building blocks are pre-assembled, so students simply snap them together like Legos instead of first learning to wire up electronic components on a breadboard. Students have to option of following along to create pre-built circuits from a workbook, or they may choose to experiment and make their own creation. This becomes an entry point to introduce the concepts of programming, which can be expanded in longer term workshop engagements using a Little Bit Arduino board. By allowing the logic of circuits to be physically manipulated in simple terms, the ideas of input, output, sliders, switches, splitting, loops, and sensors begin to have real meaning. 3D printing in the same space as circuit bending allows a crossover of prototyping objects and electronics which is an important learning connection to the emerging internet of things. All equipment is transported to the site in a 16’ trailer (Figure 2); the program can be held in and around the trailer if needed, or the equipment can be offloaded into an interior environment for a more traditional classroom or lab-like experience. Funding The initial funding was done in conjunction with the Industrial Design department at Iowa State, utilizing some initial startup funds provided by the University Provost for an “experimental classroom.” In addition, the department has provided partial appointments and a graduate student as additional support since the inception of the project. External funds were provided by Baker Group from Ankeny, Iowa to purchase the trailer used primarily for transportation but also as an outside classroom during fair weather opportunities, housing one module with tents over the other two modules. One additional grant for a design outreach studio was used in the summer of 2015 for some equipment, maintenance, and travel costs. In the summer of 2016, a formal partnership between Iowa State Extension and the College of Design provided a 3-year contract for a shared faculty appointment and funds for travel, Figure 2 FLEx trailer at an event in Van Meter, IA maintenance, and upgrades to the program with the the goal to be self-sustained and/or supported in large part by external funds and grants. Session Overview As of June 2017, FLEx has delivered a total of 171 sessions both on campus and around the state of Iowa (Figures 3 & 4). The number of sessions have continued to increase each year, with 2017 poised to exceed 2016’s previously record total. Notable sessions and locations include the Iowa State Fair, 4-H, Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE), Precollegiate Programs for Talented and Gifted, Upward Bound, and Science Bound. Sessions begin with a short 15-minute presentation on design thinking, STEM, 21st Century Skills, Industrial Design, and the possibilities of advanced and emerging technology. Students are asked what they think Industrial Designers do, and are then given examples of things this profession may have been designed (such as toothpaste, airplanes, chairs, etc.) These concrete, everyday, familiar examples help to put the students at ease and broaden their thinking and range of possibilities from just “art.” The presentation also emphasizes how young people will likely be expected to interact with tools that are considered cutting-edge today (VR, augmented reality) as part of their routine professional lives in the near future. The sooner students can be exposed to a real life, physical example of emerging technology and see the implications and applications, the better. Technology will of course be much more advanced when students enter the workforce in 5-15 years, but getting a baseline and early feel for the tools will help them adjust and relearn whatever is coming in the future. The presentation concludes with a short description and walkthrough of each piece of equipment the FLEx prov",,2017.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.jee.org/27829.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--27829?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--27829, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1b50efd59237dccb9acf777578668b8478dfac7e,"PBJ ranks higher, despite publishing more original articles, very few editorial materials and offers free global access","Welcome to the first issue of the eighteenth volume of the Plant Biotechnology Journal. PBJ has successfully transitioned from a subscription-based journal to number one open-access plant science journal. This transition has resulted in enhanced free global access to all our readers, although the open-access fee burden is borne by the authors. Scopus CiteScore ranks PBJ first among 320 Agronomy and Crop Science journals. Excluding review journals in plant sciences, CiteScore ranks PBJ third (6.88) behind New Phytologist (7.17) and Molecular Plant (7.15) but above Nature Plants (6.65) and the Plant Cell (6.88). Citescore metrics address some of the major limitations of the Impact Factor, which excludes certain article types (Letters, Commentaries, Editorials) that decrease the number of citable items but contribute citations. PBJ receives the lowest number of citations from editorial items (21 citations, 1.4%) that are not counted towards the Impact Factor, when compared to other plant science journals (e.g. 430 citations, 29% of Molecular Plant). PBJ increased Impact Factor from 6.32 to 6.84 this year, ranking higher than Plant Physiology (6.30) and the Plant Journal (5.72). PBJ ranks #5 among plant science journals publishing original research articles. Based on my current evaluation of citations, PBJ is likely to reach >8.0 Impact Factor and CiteScore in 2019 because of exceptionally high citations, with ~15% of highly cited articles that are ranked within the top one percentile of articles published in plant and animal sciences. Irrespective of the method of citation analysis, PBJ is building on the strength of high impact original inventions reported by our authors and critically evaluated by our editors/reviewers. Therefore, I convey my greatest appreciation to our authors for submitting their best research and our editors/reviewers for their critical evaluations. I look forward to your continued support in 2020. Since I started as the Editor in Chief in 2012, submission of manuscripts has almost tripled, despite transition to an openaccess journal few years ago. PBJ received a record number of manuscripts from 58 countries representing all continents around the globe in 2019, especially with more submissions from Asia, Europe and Australia. I am deeply grateful for thousands of critical evaluations received from reviewers and their generous time commitment. Timely reviews have significantly decreased the average turnaround time, rewarding our authors with timely decisions on their submissions. Considering PBJ is still a very young plant science and biotechnology journal, these are very impressive accomplishments. PBJ has increased social media activities in 2019 under the exceptional leadership of Ms. Hannah Qualtrough, Senior Marketing Manager at Wiley. Professor Shuangxia Jin (PBJ Associate Editor, Huazhong Agricultural University, China) has successfully launched the PBJ Wechat account on 1 March 2019 publishing 1,123 news articles including 364 original articles written by his students and 759 articles cited from other social media sources. This has resulted in 18,150 Wechat accounts of plant scientists, with 1,341,024 hits from 806,283 computers, 5967 hits/day and 1,750 hits per PBJ news release. In order to increase such global outreach, PBJ will start publishing foreign language abstracts to enhance outreach in their countries through the social media. Therefore, authors are encouraged to submit abstracts in English and their local languages, which will be edited by PBJ Associate Editors or editorial board members with representation from all continents. I request that authors provide Twitter titles at the time of manuscript submission. Posts from PBJ Twitter account had 32,515 impressions. In addition, I encourage authors to share news releases on their articles with the PBJ editorial office so that they are included in Wiley Plant Science tweets @PlantSciNews, which currently has >15,000 followers. I convey my sincere thanks for the excellent service offered by all our Associate Editors who have served more than ten years (Profs. Dominique Michaud, Malcolm Campbell) or in the past few years (Profs. Neal Stewart, Dave Edwards, Stephen Streatfield, Johnathan Napier, Xiao-Ya Chen, Nicola Patron, Martin Parry, Rajeev Varshney, Kan Wang) or joined recently (Drs. Caixia Gao, Zuhua He, Franc ois Belzile, Shuangxia Jin, Jihong Liu-Clarke, Marco Maccaferri). In 2020, PBJ website will feature brief biographies of editors and videos to introduce their research areas to our readers and authors. Without the outstanding leadership of Mr. Jim Ruddock – Managing Editor and Ms. Rosie Trice – Senior Publishing Manager and Ms. Lauren Dawson Editorial Assistant at Wiley, Oxford, PBJ will not be able to function and I convey my deepest appreciation. I thank Ms. Maricar Dumlao – PBJ production editor at Wiley, Manila for efficient and timely production and release of PBJ every month. PBJ is now compatible with mobile platforms, tablets, iPads and iPhones and offers several new options to evaluate the shortand long-term impacts of published articles, including Altmetric scores, article readership and citations.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.24321/0019.5138.201902 Malaria, a life-threatening protozoal infection and continues to be a global public health concern. India is also a malaria endemic country, which constitutes the highest malaria burden in the South East Asia Region. Since the major outbreak of malaria occurred in Mewat region in 1996, few studies have been carried out enumerating various factors associated with malaria prevalence and persistence in the traditionally known epidemic belt of the north-western plains of India. The purpose of the present KAP study was to determine the community perceptions in terms of malaria cause, prevention and control. A community based cross-sectional survey was carried out in four malaria endemic villages in two PHCs of district Nuh of Haryana with 190 respondents to know respondents knowledge about the disease, its prevention and control in terms of acceptance of Indoor Residual Spray. Data collected were analysed statistically using STATA version 10. Chi-Square test was used for comparison of characteristics between data collected from four villages. There was significant difference in the disease awareness between male and female, illiterate and literate and low and high income group population. 92% respondents were aware of malaria disease, 44.4% of the respondents reported as rainy season and 31.4% post rainy season and others did not know. On asking about the causative agent of malaria, 82% of the respondents associated malaria with mosquitoes which was significantly associated with the awareness and prevalence of diseases in the region. Mosquito nets, coils and repellents were commonly used as protective practices by the respondents but the difference was not found significant except for mosquito net (P<0.05) in both the study areas. The study indicates about little knowledge, less awareness and inadequate practices of respondents on various aspects of malaria 7 Thapar R et al. J. Commun. Dis. 2019; 51(1) ISSN: 0019-5138 DOI: https://doi.org/10.24321/0019.5138.201902 Introduction Malaria remains one of the most serious global health problems and is not only a major cause of morbidity and mortality, but also the cause of many socioeconomic problems.1 As per WHO World Malaria report 2018, there were 219 million cases of the disease in 2017 and the estimated global tally of malaria deaths reached 435,000. Approximately 70% of the world’s malaria burden is concentrated in just 11 countries-10 in sub-Saharan Africa and India.2 These high-burden nations are home to an estimated 151 million cases of malaria and 275,000 deaths. The Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030 (GTS) calls for reducing malaria cases and deaths by at least 40% by 2020, at least 75% by 2025 and at least 90% by 2030. In 2017, of all the 11 highest burden countries globally, African countries reported increases in malaria cases over the previous year, but only India marked progress in reducing its disease burden, registering a 24% decrease compared to 2016. The confirmed cases of malaria in India have decreased from 75 million in 1950’s to nearly 1 million in year 2017. The case loads in the country, though steady around 2 million cases annually in the late nineties, has shown a declining trend since 2002. The Slide Positivity Rate (SPR) has also shown gradual decline from 3.50 in 1995 to 0.87 in 2016. The reported Pf cases declined from 1.14 million in 1995 to 0.71 million cases in 2016. However, the Pf % has gradually increased from 39% in 1995 to 65.53% in 2016.3 Malaria is a unique disease and has roots deep within human communities. Beliefs and practices of malaria are often related to culture which can influence the effectiveness of control strategies. Thus, local knowledge and practices related to the disease are key to implementation of culturally appropriate, sustainable and effective interventions.4 Community perception, beliefs and attitude about malaria control, symptom identification, treatment, and prevention influence efforts to address malaria and are often overlooked in control efforts5 and vary from one region to other region and among individual households. Failure to consider community’s knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) about malaria may contribute to the inability of the program to achieve sustainable control.6 Hence, KAP can be an important step in developing strategies aimed at controlling malaria. In India, Malaria is transmitted by six Anopheles species of mosquitoes which are primary vectors of malaria.7 There are some other mosquito species playing a limited role in malaria transmission and recognized as secondary vectors of malaria. The control of malaria and other vectors borne diseases mainly depends on application of insecticides, Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) and use of Insecticide-Treated bed Nets (ITN)/ Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN). As very scantly information is available from the study area, the present study was carried out in four villages of malaria endemic blocks of district Nuh of the State of Haryana where malaria has been a serious public health problem. The region in the past has reported 1300 deaths due to malaria in 1996.8 Therefore, this study was planned to find out the knowledge, attitude, awareness and prevention of malaria in the selected area.

The EU Survey on R&D Investment Business Trends was carried out by the EC’s Joint Research Centre and the Directorate General for Research and Innovation. The results are based on the responses of 187 companies, most of them large and all of them chosen for their relatively heavy investment in R&D. Taken together, the 187 companies are responsible for almost V45 billion, representing around 40% of the total R&D investment by the 1,000 EU-based companies in the 2011 Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard. According to the Commission, the findings of the survey demonstrate the importance these companies assign to R&D as a key factor in their future growth and prosperity, despite the current economic difficulties. The front runner is the software and computer services sector, which expects R&D investment to grow by 11% per year on average. In-house R&D is seen as the most significant driver of innovation in the companies surveyed, followed by market research and related activities for new product innovation. ‘The positive trend for corporate R&D investment is essential for European competitiveness,’ said Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science. ‘These companies are the main drivers in making the European economy more knowledge-based and smarter. Our future research and innovation programme, Horizon 2020, will give a further boost to innovative enterprises.’ When asked about the impact of policies and external factors on their innovation activities, the companies surveyed stressed the strong positive effects of fiscal incentives, national grants, EU financial support and public–private partnerships both at national and EU levels. On the other hand, the time required to obtain intellectual property rights protection and the cost of such protection were seen by many of the companies as major obstacles to their innovation activities. The companies were also asked about various means of sharing knowledge. Collaboration agreements with other companies emerged as the most important. For companies in sectors with high R&D intensity, this was followed by licensing in or licensing out with other companies, and then by agreements with higher education institutions and other public research organizations. For companies in sectors with medium or low R&D intensity, collaboration agreements with higher education institutions and other public research organizations were seen as more important than licensing.

There were about 150 participants from the United States and neighboring countries such as the Republic of Palau. The author presented the actual condition of our research and the theory of civilization at the keynote lecture. The contents of our study are clarified in “Possibility of the biophilia rehabilitation.” The theory of civilization has to be considered because of the following idea; it is necessary to solve the problems accompanying the coming demographic transition including great subjects, such as philosophy, industrial environment, a policy, etc. which makes possible for the baby boomers who became advanced age to contribute to the society. The research of the rehabilitation was published at the e-journal of Japan Science and Technology Corporation (State Organization) by five articles from January 31, 2003. The research progress was clarified in this keynote lecture. The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHLW) set the population ratio of the elderly aged 65 and over in 2025 to 1 to 5 by the estimate of population in 1975, and introduced the silver city plan. The author presented own motivation for the study as follows; i) became the Fujisawa municipal assemblyman in 1979, ii) expected the arrival of the aged society by baby boomers' aging, iii) estimated the population dynamics by a computer which new those days, and iv) proposed enforcement of the policy corresponding to it. The estimate of the elderly population ratio in Fujisawa in 2025 was presented to the local assembly the result 1 to 4 or more. Next, the author explained his related content and fact about the rehabilitation for making the aged society expected sustainable. The regulation of the Health and Medical Service for the Aged was introduced in 1987. The city functional training meeting under the regulation was established from April Chigasaki City in adjoining for the disabled elderly of being home in the same year. The Fujisawa City’s one was established by the coordination with a medical association and was established by accepting only the disabled elderly of a disuse sustentation term from October. The Fujisawa’s meeting was ""a functional training meeting in which only those not recovering participate (impairment) "" as a lawmaker understanding from the development. The physiotherapist, Kyoko Takizawa began service at the Fujisawa’s meeting. She rehabilitated the disabled elderly who were diagnosed impairment and was getting for them remarkable results as ""those who found the improvement of condition, those who did the social (place of work) return, and those who hint suicide from disability came to tell hope."" Many patients gained a walk from bedridden in the Nagaoka Bedridden Hospital by her rehabilitation around the same time. The effect was published already 2). Besides, Kyoko Takizawa had worked as the PT of the Fujisawa Citizen Hospital. She had performed rehabilitation of the same method collaborating with two helpers for 15,000 patients every year according to the operating report of the hospital. The author persuaded her that there was a necessity to admit that her performing a rehabilitation was a method. She (the author’s mother) had not understood it for a long time depending on "" my hand is an incantatory hand since I do so that they can walk wholly."" As the years go by, it was important for the author choosing to enforce the research than the future of a politician because the social cognition of a rehabilitation system was required to sustain the aged society.

a5664e58bf0e38dc8c07972b4c503eaaa6713d3d,The Secret of the Kissing Cousins: an ER-mitochondrial tethering protein regulates Ca2+ crosstalk in mammalian neurons,"Commentary on ‘ER-mitochondria tethering by PDZD8 regulates Ca dynamics in mammalian neurons’ by Hirabayashi et al., Science 2017. In cardiomyocytes, large amounts of calcium (Ca2þ) are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the cytosol with each heartbeat. This Ca2þ is directed to sarcomeric structures to initiate muscle contraction. Within the myocytes, Ca2þ is also crucial for various signalling pathways, as it regulates cell metabolism, cell death, and nuclear gene transcription. In an attempt to understand how Ca2þ controls different cellular functions when the heart is continuously subjected to large periodic Ca2þ signals that flood through the cytoplasm and nucleus during each contraction, the concept of subcellular microdomains as highly specialized signalling hubs has emerged. In those spatially restricted spaces, numerous factors including Ca2þ levels, oxygen/glucose availability and kinase/phosphatase activity can be locally altered, yet determining overall cardiomyocyte vulnerability to diverse functional and structural outcomes (i.e. contractile function, remodelling, and apoptosis). One such example that drew significant attention in the recent years is the subcellular space between the mitochondria and the SR. Specific areas in which the distance between the organelle membranes is <30 nm have been described, and the occurrence of such intimate inter-membrane networks was termed ‘tethering’. Tethering has been shown to play multiple roles in cardiomyocytes, thereof the Ca2þ cross-talk is arguably the most important. Advancement of powerful imaging techniques facilitated mapping of the tethering proteins responsible for the three-dimensional association of mitochondrial and SR membranes in mouse ventricular myocardium; yet the molecular identity of the proteins controlling this inter-organelle apposition is still debated. For its enrichment at SR-mitochondrial junctions, Mitofusin2 was suggested to play a critical role in preserving the inter-organelle tethering and Ca2þ transfer. On the other hand, a meticulous study by Filadi et al. showed that Mitofusin2 deletion actually increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria coupling in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in which Mitofusin2 is ablated or transiently silenced, bringing a level of uncertainty to its exact role in securing the tight organelle contacts. The only ER-mitochondrial tethering complex with known molecular composition is the yeast ER-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES). It consists of at least four proteins: the ER-membrane–residing protein maintenance of mitochondrial morphology protein 1 (Mmm1), the cytosolic linker mitochondrial distribution and morphology protein 12 (Mdm12), and the integral outer mitochondrial membrane proteins Mdm34 and Mdm10. From a functional perspective, a specific ERMES ortholog would be largely expected in eukaryotic cells. Hirabayashi et al. recently demonstrated that PDZ domain containing protein 8 (PDZD8) is located at the interface of ER and mitochondrial membranes and serves to zipper them together, as well as that it is essential for Ca2þ transfer from ER to mitochondria in mammalian neurons.

After graduation, she was granted a ‘Hertha Firnberg’ fellowship for exceptional young female scientists (2013–-2017) from the Austrian Science Fund. The project investigating subcellular ion homeostasis and excitation-transcription coupling was allocated at the University of California Davis (USA) and the Medical University of Graz (Austria).

aaa01b3fcead5399f7dc3afdfba5f5cb0edc43f2,Engaging US Engineering Students in Fuel Cell Research at a Foreign Site,"The department of mechanical engineering at Oakland University University was awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) a three year grant to support a group of US undergraduate and graduate engineering student to conduct fuel cell related research at Beijing Jiaotong University in China. The program has run successfully for three consecutive summers between 2010 and 2012. The program aimed to engage the engineering students in the fuel cell research at a foreign site as well as expose them to Chinese culture. A total of 17 students from 11 different universities have taken part in the program. More than a third of the participants were female engineering students. The student participants worked in teams with Chinese students on fuel cell related projects, and participated in other activities such as touring research lab and facilities at Chinese Universities, meeting with Chinese scholars and students, and attending conferences and seminars. Another important element of the program is culture exchange. The student participants took at least 24 hours Chinese language training for an 8-week program and explored many historical sites in Beijing. The purpose of this paper is to share the experience of organizing and running an international research program and to report the program outcomes and some assessments results. We believe that the results from this paper will benefit those who seek to run a similar international program. Introduction Increasing globalization of economy and technology demands more and more college graduates who can take the challenge of collaborating internationally or working abroad upon graduation. Therefore, an international studying and/or living experience will be critical to prepare them for this challenge. For engineers to be successful in an increasing global economy, they must have an understanding and appreciation of culture and technology in other countries. One particularly important country is China, which already graduates three times as many engineers as the United States on a yearly basis. In addition, China has become an international power in the area of manufacturing and alternative energy. It might eventually become center in the world. Fuel cells produce electricity through the electrochemical reaction of an oxidant (oxygen from air) and fuel (methanol, natural gas, pure hydrogen, etc.). They have recently attracted considerable research interest due to their high power density, light weight and low emissions. However, their wide use has been limited due to high capital cost, multiple issues related to poor performance, material durability and availability, manufacturing ability, and design flexibility. Vehicles powered by fuel cells will not be affordable, durable, or available to average consumers until 2010-2020. As an arising energy conversion system, fuel cells have attracted many students’ interest. However, not many universities in US offer fuel cell course or have fuel cell related projects. With combined faculty expertise in fuel cells from Oakland University(OU) and Beijing Jiaotong University(BJTU) in China, the department of mechanical engineering at OU was awarded by P ge 23494.2 2 the National Science Foundation a three year grant to engage US engineering students in fuel cell research at a foreign site in China. The program started on Oct 1, 2009. The objective of the proposed IRES site is to annually provide five U.S. engineering students (four undergraduates and one graduate) with the unique opportunity to work on fuel cell collaborative research between OU and BJTU in Beijing, China. In the past three summers, a total of 17 students (6 females) have taken part in the IRES program. These students stayed in BJTU for 8 weeks and worked on 7 different projects related to fuel cells. An international advising team including both US and China faculty advisors worked closely with each student for the duration of the program. Students are also exposed to Chinese culture through all kinds of arranged culture exchange activities. In this paper we will discuss some of the experience that we gained from organizing this international research program over the past 3 years. Some of the planning, logistics, procedures and outcomes will be described and analyzed based on the results from program survey. Some suggestions to keep the sustainability of the program will be also provided. This type of information will be useful for peers who seek to run a similar program. Application and Recruiting The program ran for eight weeks in each summer of 2010-2012, starting in middle of May and ending in early July. Nine months before the program started, the NSF IRES flyer was prepared and was advertised through different channels including the ASME ME departmental chair email list, the professional society advisors of SWE, SAE, ASME, SME and IHAE and individual faculty members at various institutions. The program was also promoted in the classroom by engineering professors at OU. The previous NSF IRSE fellows were good advocates for the program. A website was created to advertise this program and an on-line application system was created for the convenience of application. The application deadline was usually close to the end of January. This deadline is much earlier than most of other summer REU or internship programs. The reason is that extra time is needed to prepare documents for international travel and logistics and accommodation arrangement. We received more than 70 outstanding applications (the average GPA was 3.7) from more than 60 different universities across the US including top schools such as Princeton University and Northwestern University. Of all the recruiting efforts used, the most effective in the first year were the messages sent to the ASME ME departmental chair e-mail list and previous NSF IRES participants in the second and third years. We have received more than 10 applications from ZZ University. Three of them, i.e. one for each summer, were chosen as the IRES final participants. Each application was very carefully reviewed by faculty committee at OU. The top five were selected as IRES participants. Another five students were on the waiting list. The NSF grant provided funding for five students. However, given the success of the application request and the number of qualified applicants, additional funding was sought and obtained from Oakland University’s Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs to support one additional OU student, bringing the total number of student participants in the first and second year to six in each year. The program director made calls to each candidate to confirm their interest in the program. An official offer letter was sent out to the candidates, and all the students had to return the signed letter to confirm their participation in two weeks. An email was then sent Page 23494.3 3 to notify those applicants who were not selected for the program. A brief profile of the 20102012 NSF IRES Participants is shown in Tables 1. Table 1 – Gender, affiliation, major, class level and ethnicity of 2010-2013 NSF IRES participants Gender Class Ethnicity Major Affiliation 20 10 F Jr. Caucasian ME The George Washington Univ.

The GPAs of the students varied between 3.3 and 3.94. Six out of the seventeen students funded through the NSF were female. Four were graduate students. Two students knew how to speak Mandarin, each in 2010 and 2012; none of the students knew how to speak mandarin in 2011. When selecting final participants, priority was given to those applicants who have no prior international research or travel experience. Among all the final participants, none of the students had prior research experience in China; only two students travelled to China for a short period of time with family member at their childhood. One third of student participants never had any research or internship experience, two students have the international experience of studying in Germany, and others either have an internship or REU experience. Program Structure and Activities The program runs for 8 weeks during the summer. Student participants receive $4000 stipend as well as meal allowance and a free Chinese language training course. International travel expense and lodging are covered by the program as well. Page 23494.4 4 We ran the program in two modes. In the first two years, instead of having an on-site orientation at Oakland University before departure, we met the students at BJTU directly. In the third year, we had students stay at BJTU for the first 3 weeks, then 3 weeks in China, and the last 2 weeks at OU again. From the program survey, students seem to like both modes of program. No matter which mode of the program, here are some things we have to keep in mind while arranging the program that Chinese Universities implement a different academic calendar from US Universities. The summer semester usually ends by the end of July at Chinese Universities. Therefore, our program has to finish before their final exam week (Middle July).

f8041cf08714b9b9ca06ecd26cc6bd3a20c4bbe2,Ahmed El Goresy 1934–2019,"Ahmed El Goresy died at his home in Heidelberg on October 3, 2019, at the age of 85. Ahmed El Goresy was a highly regarded mineralogist with a worldwide reputation. His research focused on minerals and mineral assemblages of extraterrestrial samples. With his major tool, reflected light microscopy, he studied meteorite samples from asteroids, the Moon, and Mars, and lunar rocks and terrestrial impactites. He was a pioneer in complementing his microscopic findings using scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe, and later the ion probe and Raman spectroscopy. He made numerous discoveries of shock-induced high pressure phases in meteorites and samples from terrestrial impact craters; he detected unusual mineral assemblages in a variety of meteorite types and studied their chemistry and isotopic composition. Ahmed El Goresy obtained his BSc in 1955 in mineralogy and petrology at the University of Heliopolis, Cairo, Egypt. In 1961, he received his PhD for work on ore deposits by using ore microscopy. His supervisor was the famous pioneer of ore microscopy Paul Ramdohr at the University of Heidelberg. Ahmed El Goresy was Ramdohr’s last and best student. In 1961, he briefly returned to Egypt taking a research position in Cairo. In 1963, he became research scientist at the Max-Planck Institut f€ ur Kernphysik in Heidelberg. He then spent some months as guest scientist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and at Harvard University before taking a 2-year postdoctoral fellowship at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. After his return to Germany, he became a senior scientist at the Max-Planck-Institut f€ ur Kernphysik in Heidelberg, and later, he was appointed professor at the Universit€at Heidelberg. In 1998, he officially retired from his position in Heidelberg and moved to the cosmochemistry department of the MaxPlanck-Institut f€ ur Chemie in Mainz. After closure of the cosmochemistry department in 2005, Ahmed El Goresy moved to the Bayerisches Geoinstitut in Bayreuth, where he continued his research projects until August 2017. During some 20 years, Ahmed El Goresy worked in close cooperation with Paul Ramdohr at the MaxPlanck-Institut f€ ur Kernphysik in Heidelberg. Paul Ramdohr, the world-leading scientist in opaque mineralogy, began his studies on meteorites only after he had retired from university in 1958. Ramdohr shared his immense knowledge of opaque minerals and his special skills in reflected light microscopy with Ahmed El Goresy. Werner Schreyer characterized Paul Ramdohr with a few sentences that apply equally well to Ahmed El Goresy: “Two keen, extremely observant eyes that could recognize the slightest differences in color or brightness; a memory with the quality of a computer to store the observations made; unlike a computer, however, brilliant intelligence that allowed Meteoritics & Planetary Science 55, Nr 2, 457–459 (2020) doi: 10.1111/maps.13432",Meteoritics and Planetary Science,2019.0,0,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/maps.13432', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/maps.13432?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/maps.13432, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ce3f9b650ecf97282898e5bc7a90eb038690faae,Preface,"5G has been a hot and heated topic all the time. In order to provide a forum for experts and scholars to share and discuss the latest research on 5G, Guangzhou Association for Science and Technology, Guangzhou Internet Society, Guangzhou Computer Society, and AEIC Academic Exchange Information Centre co-organized 2020 International Conference on 5G Mobile Communication and Information Science(MCIS-5G 2020), which was successfully held on June 26, 2020. In light of the significant influence of COVID-19 and the implementation of worldwide travel restriction, MCIS-5G 2020 conducted the form of virtual conference to avoid physical personnel gatherings but to continue to bring together all scholars even when they are in different cities. MCIS-5G 2020 thus provided a flexible platform for academics and practitioners in the field of 5G Mobile Communication and Information Science to disseminate the state-of-the-art research and enhance the collaboration between each other. We are greatly honored to have invited Prof. Bingbing Fan from South China Normal University to serve as our Conference Chair, whose interested research areas lay in Teaching and development of big data management and application, cloud computing, network computing and security. The rest of the committee was composed of nearly thirty privileged scholars from different renowned universities and institutes around the globe. The conference model consists of three sessions, including oral presentations, keynote speeches, and online Q&A discussion. In the session of oral presentations, we invited a bunch of authors to briefly present their main themes and abstracts of the excellent papers, which were selected from the high-quality submissions to this conference. Each author was given 5-10 minute to present. Then in the keynote speeches, three keynote speakers were allocated 30-45 minutes to hold their speeches. Our beloved Conference Chair, Prof. Bingbing Fan was also asked to present his latest research. In addition, we had Prof. Zhihui Zhan, representing South China University of Technology, to give his talk on Intelligent computing. The last speaker, Prof. Zheng Gong from South China Normal University, whose research areas include Cryptographic algorithms, mobile Internet, Internet of things, also shared his marvelous presentation to all audience. Both the oral presentations and keynote speeches were conducted via Zoom, the popular online collaboration tool. Lastly, as the presentations triggered various questions and discussion, we created a WeChat group, the instant communication application, to add all participants to do Q&A, which lasted for about 30-45 minutes. The online platform enabled all participants to join this grand academic event from their own home. In order to vividly present the outcome of this conference, we compiled the proceedings of MCIS-5G 2020, which features the following topics but are not limited to: Mobile communication, 5G technology and standards, Mobile Internet applications, Cloud computing and information science, Computer technology and information science, Computers and blockchain technology, and other related topics. We ensure all the papers have been through rigorous review and process to meet the requirements of International publication standard. In the end, we would like to sincerely thank the Conference Chair, the distinguished keynote speakers, as well as all the participants. We also want to express our gratitude to the publisher for publishing the proceedings. May the readers could enjoy the gain some valuable knowledge from the proceedings. We are expecting you and more experts from all over the world to join this international event next year.

c445e30d3becc2952cb2c31e85ebeb7b7977b5da,Keynote address: computers versus common sense,"Suppose that it is the year 2020, and the ‘enterprise wide knowledge utility’ is a reality. Is it dataor inferenceintensive? Where does it sit on the expressiveness versus efficiency tradeoff curve? What was the “AI bottleneck” and the “DB bottleneck” to building it? How local/guaranteed/distributed/heteroge~leous/parallel is it? Looking back thirty years from now, where should we have spent our limited resources (people and dollars) in the 90’s, to have accelerated its coming into existence? I’ll give representative answers from today’s Data Base and Artificial Intelligence communities, and my own opinions which differ at times from both of those. The upshot of that is a mandate to AI, to roll up their sleeves and begin to build and experiment with very large knowledge bases. I came to this conclusion in 1984, and with no little trepidation took my own advice. I left the field of machine learning to embark on a decade-long effort to construct a Knowledge Base with on the order of ten million assertions, spanning all of human consensus reality, down to some reasonable level of depth. Why that particular KB, instead of, say, one that focused on engineering electromechanical devices? Intelligent behavior, especially in unexpected situations, requires being able to fall back on general knowledge, and being able to analogize to specific but far-flung knowledge. Natural language understanding, even in seemingly narrow domains such as “Wall St. Journal articles about mergers and acquisitions,” also requires broad general knowledge, to resolve word sense ambiguities, elhpses, pronominal referents, and of course metaphors and analogies. And machine learning (automated discovery) occurs at the fringe of what one already knows, hence also would be empowered by such a KB. Aside from the magnitude of the task, the person-centuries it would take to build the KB, my concern stemmed from the dangers of getting stuck on representation thorns along the way (representing and reasoning with time, space, substances, belief, intention, emotion, causality, parts, awareness, contexts, counterfactuals, and so on.) Our approach had to be a pragmatic one: for each of those issues, we found a set of partial solutions which, in aggregate, efficiently covered the common cases. Notice this is a violation of the 1-2-infinity taboo which has so dominated most sciences in the past century (i.e., separately handling 27 special cases of phenomenon x is considered unesthetic, unscientific, etc.) Some of the other interesting issues in building the large KB are: how we decide what knowledge to include; how it accesses, deduces, or guesses answers; how it deals with uncertainty and contradictions; and how we coordinate a large team of knowledge enterers without having them “diverge.” We’ve gotten pretty far along already, in the process of building up an already-large KB (over a million rules and general assertions).

3f4a0583ae1ddb75d41613c3624f8673a6892086,How Generic is I(nformation) T(echnology),"Introduction A curriculum revolution has started to transform the Australian higher education sector, as several leading universities embarked on radical course reforms involving a reduction of discipline-based undergraduate course offerings in favour of a much smaller number of broad undergraduate courses integrating the humanities and science; for instance, the University of Western Australia plans to cut its undergraduate courses from seventy to six by the beginning of the 2009 academic year. Upon completion of a broad undergraduate degree, students can pursue specialised graduate courses (Slattery, 2008). The reform process has strong international parallels, as individual universities such as Harvard, and entire systems such as the European universities covered by the Bologna Accord, have embraced the cause of curriculum renewal; this renewal goes to the heart of teaching, learning and graduate competencies Victoria University has introduced a similar curriculum reform, albeit on a smaller scale. Beginning in semester 1/2009, it will offer a generic Science Degree, replacing a number of current specialist degrees. However, the generic Degree will be ""generic"" only up to a point that is, it will include a common first year and branch out into Degree specialisations in the second and third year; the specialisations will include Biotechnology, Chemistry, Food Science, Computing, Ecology, Community Science and others. The first year of the Degree will be rich in disciplinary breadth across the broad areas of the sciences, and in the second and third year intense disciplinary depth and/or professional expertise will be gained. The composition of the first year was subject to much debate, as representatives of the various specialisations fought to convince the program committee that theirs was an area of general interest and importance and therefore should be studied by all students. The arguments put forward by the computing experts were particularly compelling. Given that IT, or indeed computer science, underpins many of the scientific disciplines, it was only fitting that the development of computing skills should apply to all science students and that it should start in the first year of the Degree. This decision was supported by Microsoft Research Cambridge's report ""Towards 2020 Science"" (Microsoft Research, 2005). This report was the result of a workshop that invited an international group of natural and computer scientists to put together a roadmap for science, and particularly computing, over the next sixteen years before 2020. The central tenet was that computer science would transform science in two ways: as a tool for doing ""traditional"" science, and as a technique for performing experiments and creating models. Thus, the study has strongly identified the importance of mathematical, quantitative and computational and indeed IT skills to all students in science. It concluded that 'Scientists will need to be completely computationally and mathematically literate, and by 2020, it will simply not be possible to do science without such literacy' (Microsoft Research, 2005, p. 8). While information literacy skills have been recognised in most science course curricula, more advanced IT skills and digital literacy have been largely overlooked; yet, they are all-encompassing with applications that permeate various disciplines of science (Miliszewska, 2008). Thus IT should be regarded as a powerful facilitator to higher-level learning. How should this advanced IT literacy be developed? How can its relevance be maintained in a generic Degree? Is such literacy generic? The following sections discuss these issues and propose suggestions for introducing essential tools and technologies for tomorrow's scientists. The Need for IT Skills in Science Students Today's members of the skilled workforce are expected to display a broad range of generic skills including good communication and team working abilities, strong problem-solving and numeric proficiency and, most particularly, expertise in information technology. …",,2009.0,3,"{'url': 'http://iisit.org/Vol6/IISITv6p193-199Miliszewska640.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.28945/1052?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.28945/1052, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5c9c1a7425e32f25cb8ef11738e9f5f2d8c147c2,Quantum computers: where do we stand?,"Q uantum mechanics has had an enormous technological and societal impact. To grasp this point, it is sufficient to cite the invention of the transistor, perhaps the most remarkable among the countless other applications of quantum mechanics. It is also easy to see the enormous impact of computers on everyday life. The importance of computers is such that it is appropriate to say that we are now living in the information age. This information revolution became possible thanks to the invention of the tran­ sistor, that is, thanks to the synergy between computer science and quantum physics. Today this synergy offers completely new opportunities and promises exciting advances in both funda­ mental science and technological application. We are referring here to the fact that quantum mechanics can be used to process and transmit information [1,2]. Miniaturization provides us with an intuitive way of under­ standing why, in the near future, quantum laws will become important for computation. The electronics industry for com­ puters grows hand-in-hand with the decrease in size of integrated circuits. This miniaturization is necessary to increase computa­ tional power, that is, the number of floating-point operations per second (flops) a computer can perform. In the 1950's, electronic computers based on vacuum-tube technology were capable of performing approximately 103 floating-point operations per second, while nowadays there exist supercomputers whose power is greater than lOteraflops (1013 flops). As we have remarked, this enormous growth of computational power has been made possi­ ble owing to progress in m in ia tu riza tion , which may be quantified empirically in Moore's law. This law is the result of a remarkable observation made by Gordon Moore in 1965: the number of transistors on a single integrated-circuit chip doubles approximately every 18 24 months. This exponential growth has not yet saturated and Moore's law is still valid. At the present time the limit is approximately 108 transistors per chip and the typical size of circuit components is of the order of 100 nanometres. Extrapolating Moore's law, one would estimate that around the year 2020 we shall reach the atomic size for storing a single bit of inform ation. At tha t point, quan tum effects will become unavoidably dominant. One should be aware that, besides quantum effects, other fac­ tors could bring Moore's law to an end. In the first place, there are economic considerations. Indeed, the cost of building fabri­ cation facilities to m anufacture chips has also increased exponentially with time. Nevertheless, it is important to under­ stand the ultimate limitations set by quantum mechanics. Even though we might overcome economic barriers by means of tech­ nological breakthroughs, quantum physics sets fundamental limitations on the size of the circuit components. The first ques­ tion under debate is whether it would be more convenient to push the silicon-based transistor to its physical limits or instead to devel­ op alternative devices, such as quantum dots, single-electron transistors or molecular switches. A common feature of all these devices is that they are at the nanometre length scale, and there­ fore quantum effects play a crucial role. So far, we have talked about quantum switches that could sub­ stitute silicon-based transistors and possibly be connected together to execute classical algorithms based on Boolean logic. In this perspective, quantum effects are simply unavoidable correc­ tions that must be taken into account owing to the nanometre size of the switches. A quantum computer represents a radically differ­ ent challenge: the aim is to build a machine based on quantum logic, that is, a machine that can process the information and perform logic operations in agreement with the laws of quantum mechanics.",,2005.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2005/01/epn05105.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1051/epn:2005105?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1051/epn:2005105, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2b73c6f8be2b7633a8db12f3be71daab8fadd71c,245th American Chemical Society Meeting and Exposition (ACS Spring 2013),"The 245th American Chemical Society Meeting and Exposition took place in Morial Convention Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, on April 7–11, 2013. New Orleans, located in southeastern Louisiana and by the mouth of the Mississippi River, was founded by the French Mississippi Company in 1718 and named for the Regent of France at that time, Philippe d’Orléans, Duke of Orléans. This “sleepless” city with the population of 350 000 people is famous for its distinct French architecture, diverse culture, jazz music, annual celebrations and festivals, and Cajun food. The city also reminds us of damaging Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and people who seriously suffered from the hurricane but have learned to turn the fears and challenges into opportunities. The American Chemical Society (ACS) has more than 164 000 members, and is the world’s largest scientific society. It holds the spring and fall meetings each year, bringing in 15 000 industry, academic and government professionals around the world and providing the biggest platform for thousands of researchers to share their up-to-date scientific and professional information through plenary sessions, symposia, poster sessions, exhibitions, and networking events. Each meeting has its own chemistry-related theme. This year, 27 divisions and seven committees hosted various programs based on the meeting theme of Chemistry of Energy and Food. With over 15 000 attendees, the meeting received almost 12 000 papers and had 4500 poster presentations as well as a number of special events, such as governance and business meetings, division meeting and social events, presidential events, national awards, industrial awards, educational events for students and teachers, professional advancements in New Orleans etc. Symposia covered a wide range of topics, including food and nutrition, medicine, health, energy, environment, and other fields where chemistry plays a central role in preventing and combating disease, and organized by various divisions, such as Division of Agricultural and Food Chemistry (26 symposia), Division of Biological Chemistry (25 symposia), Division of Chemical Health and Safety (six symposia), Division of Chemical Education (39 symposia), Division of Energy and Fuels (31 symposia), Division of Polymer Chemistry (22 symposia) etc. The details on the divisions and their symposia can be viewed at http://abstracts.acs.org/ chem/245nm/program/divisionindex.php. Sunday afternoon was the plenary session, based on the meeting theme of Chemistry of Energy and Food, and organized by thematic program chair Prof. James N. Seiber, Food Science and Technology Department, UC Davis, CA. Four invited speakers from universities and industry shared their expertise in “Chemistry of food flavors: Simply pleasure or beyond?” (Peter Schieberle, Department of Food Chemistry, Technical University of Munich, Freising, Freising, Germany); “Feeding the world through science and technology: A Look into our future food system” (John D Floros, College of Agriculture, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS); “Kitchen as laboratory: building bridges between science and the non-scientist” (Cesar Vega, Mars Botanical, Mars, Inc., Germantown, MD); “Microalgal triglyderide oils: A new source of renewable oil for energy and food” (Walter Rakitsky, Solazyme, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Starting from Monday morning, presidential event, organized by the ACS president Dr. M. Wu, had different sessions covering the topics of Understanding Climate Change, Vision 2025: How to Succeed in the Global Chemistry Enterprise, and Water: A Grand Challenge for Science and Society. Those sessions brought in presidents of chemical societies around the world and leaders from industry, academia, government and small business to explore the global challenges and opportunities. Besides the plenary session and presidential event, a number of symposia focused on the theme of this year’s ACS meeting. The symposium on Polymer Composites for Energy Harvesting, Conversion and Storage by the Division of Polymer Chemistry discussed five up-to-date research topics, including fundamental studies of structure-propertyperformance relationships and applications of these materials in photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, fuel cells and batteries, and energy storage. More than 30 speakers presented state-of-art synthesis, characterization, measurement and modeling techniques applied to polymer composites. Invited speaker Prof. M. Dadman, University of Tennessee, addressed the key processing challenges, such as structural and morphological control and interface characterization, and their solutions using neutron scattering technique. Another invited speaker Prof. D. Carroll, Wake Forest University, presented polymer nanocomposites for thermoelectric applications, which could convert waste heat into electricity power. Computer modeling combined with experiments play crucial and integrated roles, to provide detailed insight into structure, capture the structure–property–performance relationships, advance the understanding of experimental observations, as well as rapidly speed up new materials development. The symposium on Theory and Simulation in Energy and Fuel Production and Utilization organized by the Division of Energy and Fuels reported recent development and implementation of theory and computational modeling approaches for energy research. For example, the presentations included “Structure–reactively relations in heterogeneous catalysts” by R. A. van Santen; “Atomistic theory of Ostwald ripening and disintegration of supported nanoparticles under reaction",Powder Diffraction,2013.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/S0885715613000547?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/S0885715613000547, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

They are all terrible diseases that have no cure. But while some of these diseases have specific groups working together on research to find a cure, there are still some that have been overlooked. Leprosy, schistosomiasis, and trachoma are only some of the many tropical diseases that are being neglected. The reasoning behind this is simple; tropical diseases are low on the priority list for big pharmaceutical companies because there is low return on the research and production of these drugs. Since the majority of the population that is affected by these diseases is found in undeveloped countries, they do not have the financial means to pay for such patented drugs. So what is to be done? Do we just leave these people to figure it out alone or even worse, die? With over one billion people affected (one sixth of the world’s population) mostly in the developing world, the World Health Organization calls these neglected tropical diseases “a symptom of poverty and disadvantage.” Diseases include but are not limited to Malaria, African sleeping sickness, Dengue Fever, Schistosomiasis, Leishmaniasis, Chagas Disease, Tuberculosis, Leprosy, Toxoplasma, soil transmitted Helminths, and Trachoma. One study shows that if Tuberculosis is not stopped, over one billion people will be infected with Tuberculosis alone by the year 2020! In November of 2005, an open collaborative research website was launched with the idea of sharing research to find cures for these diseases. Founder and executive director Ginger Taylor leads this group, called The Synaptic Leap (TSL), with passion and persistence. The name comes from the communication of the body’s cells through neurons which pass information from dendrite to dendrite across a synaptic cleft. The information then travels down the axon and is sent on to the next cell. Some call this the synaptic leap. This is synonymous to the general idea behind this organization whose mission statement states that they wish “to provide a network of online research communities that connect and enable open source biomedical research.” They believe that this will be an effective way to generate ideas more quickly as well as reduce redundant work because other members will be able to see what research has already been conducted and the results of this research. The Synaptic Leap group is actually a web-based group of collaborative scientists who volunteer their time, computer power, and reagents in hopes that they will eventually lead to enough information that will be available online so that others can Picture courtesy of The Synaptic Leap.",,2009.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.33697/ajur.2009.002', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33697/ajur.2009.002?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33697/ajur.2009.002, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2c2e7e7297788f7254175c6de1182941622a6124,"High performance computing and simulation: architectures, systems, algorithms, technologies, services, and applications","In many areas, high-performance computing (HPC) and simulation have become determinants of industrial competitiveness and advanced research. Following the progress in aerospace, automobile, environmental, energy, healthcare, and networking industries, most research domains nowadays measure the strategic importance of their developments vis-á-vis the mastering of these critical technologies. Intensive computing and numerical simulation are now essential tools that contribute to the success in systems designs, effectiveness of public policies such as prevention of natural hazards and taking account of climate risks, but also to security and national sovereignty. Yet, the fact that simulation is employed by a large number of users does not mean that they all contribute equally to the advancement of this science. It is widely anticipated that the continual progress and investment in HPC and simulation will bring about innovations and technologies that will contribute to the growth and evolution in all major scientific domains. For instance, the simulation of complex phenomena, such as biological and living components, will lead to spectacular scientific breakthroughs. In terms of hardware and software architectures, we can expect exaflopic performances [1] to be reached before 2020. Exascale computing is however an inspiring challenge, implying difficult but invigorating technological obstacles. The arrival of General Purpose-Graphical Processing Units (GP-GPU) has impacted the pace of improvements in peak performances. However, this development implies rethinking the use of such architectures to obtain maximum performance or peak return whenever possible. In some cases, these technologies will require significant efforts to adapt them to existing applications. At the same time, they will also impact the design of future applications. Furthermore, they will require acquiring and building new tools and infrastructure [2–5]. HPC has so far been a laboratory for the development of techniques, technologies, services, and applications that sooner or later will end up in future consumer desktop computers. Nowadays, desktops and laptops have vector processing capabilities, with Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions, similar to what Cray proposed in the seventies (Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) are also now available since the introduction of Intel’s Sandy Bridge processor). Equally, the introduction of the personal ‘super-computer’ in 2008 with NVIDIA’s Tesla boards (1 Teraflop single precision) changed the way we think about HPC [6]. Such components have been introduced in the design of supercomputers and clusters [7]. At the time of the High Performance Computing and Simulation (HPCS) 2010 conference, three of the first five supercomputers ranked in the ‘top500’ [8] were hybrid, some with Tesla boards and others with the Fermi architecture, which considerably improved double precision performances [9,10]. At the time of writing this editorial, double Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) with thousands of cores are available. An IBM BlueGene/Q system named Sequoia has been recently installed at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This supercomputer achieved 16.32 petaflop/s on the Linpack benchmark using 1,572,864 cores. It is also one of the most energy efficient systems in the Top500 list. For next year, supercomputers are expected to be more energy efficient while surpassing the 20 petaflops milestone, and we anticipate even higher peak performances and efficiencies in the subsequent years. In addition, the introduction in 2009 of Intel’s Sandy Bridge [11] and AMD’s Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) [12] will also impact the way we will design and program these new parallel architectures. These exciting developments are also a challenge we will have to deal with. Generalist multicore architectures will arrive around 2013 with the commercial availability of the Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture [13, 14] (Xeon Phi is the final name retained by Intel for the commercialization of this",Concurrency and Computation,2013.0,3,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/cpe.2955', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/cpe.2955?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/cpe.2955, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a606e0d56af76a109dd4fc1d055c943a9a351925,Educating Engineers for the 21st. Century: and why some Elements of History and Philosophy should be Incorporated into the Curriculum,"It has been said that in some respects the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky was a magpie – borrowing styles and ideas from diverse sources for whatever musical project he was working on. The practice of engineering has this same characteristic in that it willingly takes ideas, knowledge and techniques from wherever in pursuit of completing its goal. Further, Engineering is, at least in part, in agreement with Fyodor Dostoevsky – ‘if everything on Earth were rational, nothing would happen’. Against such a background it is proposed that a framework based on both philosophy and the history of engineering, science and technology constitutes a valid footing upon which engineers can be enabled to see and develop their profession in a suitably rounded manner. Engineering as a discipline has advanced considerably in the technological sense and a thorough understanding of technological developments is an important part of the ‘creation’ of an engineer. But it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a lot more to engineering than science and technology together with a few elements of business. Today, the established and accepted method of educating the engineer evolved in the postwar era of the 1950’s and was based on first teaching the fundamental scientific principles and following in later years with discipline-specific knowledge and design techniques. Industry was then left to educate the young engineer in the on-the-job skills of teamwork, communications, ethics, etc. In recent years a number of important and influential bodies have begun to explore whether this accepted method is the appropriate model for educating engineers given the challenges that they will face in their career. For example the US National Academy of Engineering has described the engineer of 2020 and proposed mechanisms to educate that engineer. Educational standards bodies such as ABET and corresponding ones in Europe including Engineers Ireland have developed new accreditation guidelines for engineering programmes to ensure that graduates from these programmes have the skills that were traditionally left to industry to develop in their engineering employees. Within industry, companies have identified the desired attributes that they seek in an engineer. All these revised skills and attributes leads one to the conclusion that the modern world requires a more rounded and developed engineer. Coming from a different direction authors such as Rosalind Williams and John Heywood (both from what might loosely be termed the liberal arts) have conjectured that the engineering profession has lost its identity. And it is argued that in the long run engineers will have to face up to a long term convergence between technological and liberal arts education. Their prediction is that if engineers do not accept a hybrid educational activity they will be consigned to purely technical work activities. And consequently the engineer would not be ideally suited to provide the type and level of leadership required in our more complex society. In Europe, implementation of the Bologna Declaration provides an excellent opportunity to examine how some degree of convergence between technological and liberal arts education can be achieved in the context of a two-cycle engineering system of education. The first cycle, of normal duration three years, might not admit much in the way of such a convergence and it might also be problematic in the second-cycle especially if such a degree is not designed to follow on directly from a specific first cycle one. However there is good scope for incorporating appropriate elements of liberal education in an integrated five year programme. But what should these elements be? Reaching any consensus on this will not be straightforward when one considers, for example, the report by the Royal Academy of Engineering (UK) Educating Engineers for the 21st Century, June 2007 which states that “Universities must continue to teach 'core engineering' and not dilute course content with peripheral subject matter. They add that ‘there is a limited requirement for training in key business skills, envisaged primarily as commercial awareness an understanding of how businesses work and the importance of the customer – combined with the basic principles of project management.” This view is sharply contrasted with that of IBM where they envisage services, sciences, management and engineering “bringing together ongoing work in computer science, operations research, industrial engineering, business strategy, management sciences, social and cognitive sciences, and legal sciences to develop the skills required in a services-led economy.” Going a little further, educators such as Gary Downey have developed an Ethnographical approach exploring the relationship between knowledge and personhood (engineer). Again from an educational perspective, consider Harvey Mudd College, California, which “seeks to educate engineers, scientists, and mathematicians, well versed in all of these areas and in the humanities and the social sciences so that they may assume leadership in their fields with a clear understanding of the impact of their work on society.” The National Academy of Engineering (US) in The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century sets the goal to “maintain the nation’s economic competitiveness and improve the quality of life for people around the world, engineering educators and curriculum developers must anticipate dramatic changes in engineering practice and adapt their programs accordingly.” In addition to identifying the ideal attributes of the engineer of 2020, the report recommends ways to improve the training of engineers to prepare them for addressing the complex technical, social, and ethical questions raised by emerging technologies. Boeing have, inter alia, identified the Desired Attributes of an Engineer other than technical that includes a basic understanding of the context in which engineering is practiced. Amongst topics addressed are: economics, history, ethics, the environment, as well as customer and societal needs. Some of the skills identified include: good communications, high ethical standards, an ability to think critically and creatively and independently, the ability and selfconfidence to be flexible, and an understanding of the importance of teamwork. What is clear overall is that a body of engineers and engineering educators do believe that the educational development of a “more rounded” engineer needs to be achieved. This article considers one particular aspect of what could be best achieved through an exposure to elements of a traditional liberal arts education and that is the role of the history of ideas in engineering coupled with an analysis of some major engineering developments from a philosophical perspective. A range of examples are included with particular emphasis on ‘design’ illustrating the proposed approach and the examples are chosen not for the depth involved but rather to ensure that they can be understood by a general audience. The roles of heuristics, empiricism, rationalism, logic, ethics, and aesthetics are considered illustrating the relevance of philosophy to the practice of engineering. In addition some comments on an evolutionary perspective are presented using the ‘meme’ concept of Dawkins. Our goal in this paper is to demonstrate that the education of the modern engineer will be improved by focusing on the development of a range of attributes both from the traditional engineering pedagogy but also attributes more usually developed through a liberal arts education, including history and philosophy. The successful result, we argue, will be the well-rounded or morerounded engineer of the 21 century. But, however convincing the case might be to the authors, it is an entirely different matter when it comes to winning the argument with academic staff in an engineering faculty or school to include some element of liberal arts education in what is usually an already tightly packed curriculum. And even if an acceptance is won there still remains the problem of deciding how to deliver to the students the chosen liberal arts. For the first challenge there is no ready simple solution. Colleges are often conservative for good reasons and are not overly susceptible to the current demands of industry and would generally claim that they are educating their students not for ‘the first job’ but for life. Nevertheless this ‘for life’ aspect coupled with the recruitment policies of some influential employers should eventually bring about the conditions by which the engineering curriculum is opened to include liberal arts studies such as philosophy. There is also peer pressure as an agent of change by which well regarded institutions can influence others. Further once some empirical evidence is accumulated that demonstrates that there are benefits to be obtained accrediting bodies will be encouraged to make provision in their requirements for a broadened engineering curriculum. Finally, on this first challenge, the identification of some metrics by which the benefits can be assessed in time is a task that engineering educationalists should address now. Regarding the second challenge – how to deliver the liberal arts material in an engineering programme. This question has a parallel with what is sometimes a contentious matter in an engineering faculty, namely should mathematics be taught by engineers to engineers or should mathematics be a subject taught by mathematicians. Happily the evidence is that both approaches can work and depends heavily on the teaching style, interests and enthusiasm of the staff involved. The authors of this article favour a ‘have your cake and eat it approach’ by first having engineering staff embed in their technical subjects some elements of philosophy, history of engineering and science, and the history of ideas, largely through well chosen examples. And then at a later stage",,2007.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21427/D79Z2D?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21427/D79Z2D, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Orin The Ohio State University Industrial Robot Statistics and Industrial Activities The word “robot” is well known among the general public. This familiarity is due in large part to the many science fiction books, films, cartoons, and toys related to robots. Popular culture, as well as impressive demonstrations of humanoid robots (particularly by Honda and Sony), has fueled the public’s imagination about the potential applications of robotics. The expectations of our field are high, even though most of the public is unfamiliar with robotics science and technology. One expectation is that the robotics industry will continue to grow and contribute to the improvement of our daily lives. As a robotics scientist and a member of RAS, I certainly hope that this expectation will be fulfilled. One serious social issue that should be addressed by robotics is the decrease of labor power to maintain industrial activities and social services as the elderly population continues to increase. For example, in Sweden and Japan, it is predicted that one in four people will be more than 65 years old in 2020. In such a society, a large number of people will need physical assistance in their daily lives. The robot is expected to be an important technology to solve these social problems, and these issues are expected to provide a significant stimulus to robotics industry. Looking at the current robotics industry, however, the gap between expectations and current industrial activities may raise concerns that the robot industry is ill-positioned to confront the technological challenges of the future. In Japan, in 2000, total sales of industrial robots were about $660 million (Japan Robot Association statistics). International Federation of Robotics statistics say that Japan accounted for about 40% of worldwide sales of robots in 2000. We can then estimate that total worldwide sales of industrial robots was about US$1,400 million in 2000. This amount is minute in comparison to other big industries such as the computer and semiconductor industries. Because popular expectations of robotics have been so high for so long and because the apparent robotics market is still so small, many people doubt that robotics industrial activity will flourish in the future. When discussing statistics on the market size of industrial robots, however, we need to exercise caution. The statistics do not include the majority of robotic technology used in our society. Even for factory automation, there are many robots that are not included in the statistics. For example, last year one of the largest Japanese automobile companies announced that they would introduce commercially available industrial robots into their factories, even though they already had many robots in their factory. Their current robots, developed in house, were not bought on the commercial market and were certainly not included in the statistics. In fact, the vast majority of the current robotics market falls in the category of “custom made,” rather than commercially available “readymade” robots, and these sales and development costs are rarely included in the statistics. Custom-made robots appear in applications such as automated production lines, cleaning systems for airplane bodies, and space robots such as the Mars Sojourner, Spirit, and Opportunity. Although custom-made robots are not manufactured in quantities comparable to commercially available robots, because of the large number of applications involving custom-made robots, this market is too large to be",IEEE Robotics Autom.

The number of abstracts submitted for review has reached a plateau at about 7500-8000 in the last years (Figure 1). This high number of submissions underscores the strength of basic, epidemiological and clinical science in Europe and abroad, as well as the attractiveness of the European Congress as a whole. After vigorous reviewing by more than 800 graders a total of 2739 abstracts have been accepted for presentation or posters. It is good to see that over the last years the quality of the abstracts markedly improved. At this occasion, we therefore would like to thank all members of the Abstract Review Committee for their excellent work, which allowed us to evaluate the abstracts in such a short time. Thus, thanks to its active members, the Congress has established itself as one of the largest and most respected meetings in cardiovascular medicine and science in Europe and around the world. Figure 1. Abstracts submitted to the annual congress The abstract review procedure has basically remained unchanged. However, reviewers are now grading the abstracts online. The review process is by topic and 8 colleagues grade each abstract with expertise in that area. These abstracts are blinded for the author's names, city and country of origin. The average grade given by these 8 experts was used to select the best abstracts for further evaluation (oral or poster presentation) by members of the Congress Programme Committee. This procedure of abstract grading allows us to handle almost 8000 abstracts in the most objective way. The final selection and programming was in the hands of 29 Members and consultants of the Congress Programme Committee and we are grateful for their contribution. It is important to note that selecting an abstract for oral or poster presentation does not reflect the grades this abstract received. Oral sessions are constructed by the Programme Committee to present related work covering one particular topic. Thus, the poster sessions feature some of the highest graded abstracts of the congress. It was the explicit wish of the Congress Programme Committee to increase the awareness of the audience that a lot of excellent abstracts can be found in the poster sessions. Thus, each poster session also includes a selection of 10 moderated posters. These posters represent the highest quality abstract. These posters will be presented and discussed in an especially designed and highlighted area of the poster area using microphone support. We would like to thank all authors who submitted abstracts demonstrating their interest in the ESC Congress. The abstracts accepted for oral and poster presentation cover major areas of cardiovascular medicine among them arrhythmias and cardiac pacing (14%), myocardial infarction and angina (10%), myocardial function and heart failure (I1%) and D ow naded rom http/academ ic.p.com /eurheartj/articact/23/Abstract_Supplem ent586454 by gest on 15 M arch 2020 iv Abstract Selection interventional cardiology (7%). The molecular and cellular mechanisms always were an important aspect of the programme; indeed about a quarter of the abstracts were from basic science, which is a steep increase from the past. This year, however, we made it a focus by introducing the Basic Science Track. This new feature led to special sessions and lectures on the hottest topics in cardiovascular research. The initiative is ajoint venture of the European Society of Cardiology and other professional groups interested in this field such as the International Society for Heart Research (ISHR), the European Vascular Biology Association (EVBA) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS). The scientific programme of the 2002 Congress offers a large variety of symposia, debates as well as interactive sessions on imaging, intervention and problems of practical cardiology (FOCUS Imaging and Intervention; FOCUS Cardiology Practice) organized by the Congress Programme Committee and the Working Groups, as well as 126 sessions with 826 oral presentations based on the submitted abstracts. In addition abstracts will be presented as posters and 12 abstracts are scheduled as computer demonstration sessions. These abstracts come from 47 member countries of the ESC (86%) and from 54 other countries (14%) from all over the world. As in previous years, several sessions have been organized in close co-operation with the American College of Cardiology (ACC), with the American Heart Association (AHA), with the European Resuscitation Council (ERC), with the European Heart Network (EHN), with the World Heart Foundation (WHF), with the Union of European Medical Specialists (UEMS). The traditional ESC Lectures will be held on Clinical Cardiology (2), Basic Sciences (1) and Population Sciences (1). This year there will again be three Hot Line Sessions, presenting results of the newest clinical trials focusing on acute myocardial infarction, heart failure and hypertension. As a new feature two sessions devoted on ""Recent Clinical Trial Updates"", for example additional analyses of large clinical trials which have already been presented recently, will be part of the programme. Recognition of excellence is important. This year there are three abstract sessions in which the best science from young investigators under the age of 35 years will be competitively presented. Attractive prizes for the three winning abstracts in each of the three sessions are given by the Society, at the time of the Awards Ceremony. To all organizers, participants and accompanying persons, we extend a warm welcome. We hope you will enjoy the conference, both scientifically and socially. T.F. LUSCHER, MD, F.E.S.C. M.L.

ISBN: 0-444-50529-6. Pp xxvii+886. Amsterdam: Elsevier. NLG6455, Euros292.69 . Website: www.elsevier.com This two-part book reports the proceedings of the 3rd World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in Life Sciences, held in Bologna, Italy from 29 August to 2 September 1999. In two volumes, totalling 1795 pages, it forms Volume 31 (A and B) of Deve lopm ents in Anim al and Ve te rinary Science s, published by Elsevier. The Congress was attended by 800 participants from 39 countries and included 9 plenary lectures, 35 parallel sessions, 4 debates and more than 250 poster presentations. The size of the meeting gives a clear indication of the intense interest and activity that surrounds the development of alternative methods, and these volumes give comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the Three Rs of replacement, reduction and re®nement of animal testing in areas as varied as toxicology, behavioural research, vaccine testing and education. The organizers of the conference clearly took pains to achieve a balance between the contributions on each of the Three Rs. There are extensive contributions on reduction and re®nement, as well as on replacement, which tends to take centre stage at this type of conference. The published proceedings of scienti®c conferences often make rather unsat isfactory reference books, the individual contributions sometimes being of variable quality and relevance, and tending to become rapidly outdated. This is not the case with this massive work. The quality of the contributed papers is generally very high and each session has a separate summary. The four Point/Counterpoint Debates on con ̄icts between human and animal rights, ending animal use by the year 2020, primate use, and endocrine disrupter testing, provide very interesting insights into differing viewpoints on these important issues. No less than 26 other topics are covered by concise summaries of workshops. The quality of the index matches that of the body of the text. As a summary of the state of the art implementation of the Three Rs at the end of the millennium, it is hard to fault these volumes. William Russell, co-author with the late Rex Burch, of the book that introduced the concept of the Three Rs in 1959, gives a concise and witty summary of the progress made during the intervening 40 years, and this is followed by the Declaration of Bologna, reaf®rming the commitment of the meeting participants to the Three Rs principle. Depending on one’s point of view, it is possible either to be heartened by the progress that has been made, and the enormous effort that is still being put into the development of humane alternatives, or profoundly depressed by the slow pace of their implementation in practice. These volumes provide an invaluable compilation of current activity in all aspects of the Three Rs and will be a very useful source of reference for everyone who is interested in this ®eld. They will be of great interest and value, not only for laboratory scientists, but also for animal welfarists, regulators, and members of ethical committees. There are numerous technical papers on test methods, including genomics and computer modelling, but the problems of test validat ion and barriers to the regulatory acceptance of alternative tests are also discussed in depth. If I could only have one book on the Three Rs, I would certainly want this one, or rather two. Be warnedÐthe covers of the two volumes are almost identical. Do not be tempted to think that you have acquired two copies and give one away to a friend!",,2001.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1258/0023677011911868', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1258/0023677011911868?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1258/0023677011911868, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

47663f81e71ec289ae4512b08da0cf7c7dafa413,"ChatGPT, AI Advertising, and Advertising Research and Education","Since ChatGPT was released on November 30, 2022, followed by Microsoft’s announcement of its artificial intelligence (AI)–powered new Bing search engine on February 7, 2023, and Google’s Bard release on March 21, 2023, it seems AI generally has taken over conversations across all sectors of society. In a very short time span, consumers and a wide range of organizations have adopted generative AI technologies with astonishing capabilities (Bove 2023). These new technological developments have accelerated the integration of AI into many tools, apps, and areas of our daily life, but the transformative AI technology is perhaps most deeply impacting the world of advertising. AI-enabled advertising spending worldwide in 2022 was estimated to be $370 billion, with predictions of $1.3 trillion in the next ten years (Statista 2023). While the viral sensation and enormous popularity of ChatGPT are generating unprecedented attention and interest in AI right now, AI, as both a theoretical concept and version of its technological implementations and applications, has a long history with its origin going back to the 1950s. In the advertising field, the first research article on the topic of AI in connection to advertising was published in 1988 (Cook and Schleede 1988). The authors described “decision support systems” (i.e., expert systems) as probably the “most widely implemented and well-known applications of AI” (48). As described, these systems used databases and models to solve problems, such as help with direct-mail systems and newspaper advertising placement. Since then, AI has changed the business of media and advertising and attracted attention from both advertising practitioners and scholars. Although there is no standard definition, Rodgers (2021) defined AI advertising as “brand communication that uses a range of machine functions that learn to carry out tasks with intent to persuade with input by humans, machines, or both” (2) and positioned AI advertising as a subdiscipline of advertising “situated at the intersection of cognitive science, computer science, and advertising” (2). Advertisers are using AI technologies in automated market segmentation and targeting, ad creative development and personalization, improving ad buying and placement, and optimizing advertising investment (Kietzmann, Paschen, and Treen 2018). Following the trend of increasing AI adoption in advertising, advertising scholars have organized sessions at the American Academy of Advertising (AAA) conference, such as the 2014 preconference, “Big Data for Advertising Research and Education,” and the joint AAA-ANA Educational Foundation luncheon panel with the provocative title, “The Future of Advertising—Will We Be Replaced by Robots?” in 2018. The Journal of Advertising (JA) has published multiple themed collections on AI-related topics, starting with a Special Section on Artificial Intelligence and Advertising, guest-edited by Hairong Li (2019). This collection of articles explored the potential and actual application of AI technologies to enhance advertising efficiency, effects, and effectiveness across the entire spectrum of the advertising campaign process, from situation analysis and consumer insight generation to advertising message creation, to media planning and buying, and to advertising effect assessment (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 48, no. 4). Another Special Section on Advances in Computational Advertising in 2020, guest edited by Jisu Huh and Ed Malthouse (2020), addressed broad implications of evolving computer science technologies for data-driven, AI-powered computational advertising, and proposed a future research agenda in the areas of macro and exogenous factors, consumers’ roles in computational advertising, AI-powered ad content generation, computational advertising media planning strategy shifts from purchasing exposure to focusing on meaningful consumer engagement, and computational advertising measurement systems (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 49, no. 4). A year later, JA published an up-to-date comprehensive Themed Issue on Promises and Perils of Artificial Intelligence and Advertising (2021, vol. 50, no. 1). In her editorial, the previous editor, Shelly Rodgers (2021) proposed an AI classification schema to systematically understand and develop subdomains",Journal of Advertising,2023.0,45,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00913367.2023.2227013?needAccess=true&role=button', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/00913367.2023.2227013?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2023.2227013, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8ceb2849e22eca6aa188b773360a9526ee8b5b8d,Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for Ukrainian Stomatologists (Dentists) and Maxillofacial Surgeons: Criteria for Awarding CPD Points as of 2024,"Continuing professional development (CPD) of Ukrainian doctors-stomatologists (dentists) and maxillofacial surgeons is a continuous process of learning and improving the professional competencies of stomatologists and maxillofacial surgeons, which enables them to maintain or increase the level of professional activity in accordance with the needs of the health care sector. CPD can be both voluntary and mandatory, depending on the dental legislation of each European country. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the key legislation aspects of CPD related with criteria for awarding CPD points to the Ukrainian doctors of all eight stomatological specialties. The number of required CPD points and criteria for awarding CPD points are regulated by (1) Order of the Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine of February 22, 2019, No. 446 “Some Issues of CPD of Doctors” and by (2) the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of July 14, 2021, No. 725 “On Approval of the Regulation on the System of CPD of Healthcare Workers”. In 2024, at least 100 CPD points obtained in 2020, 2021 and at least 50 CPD points obtained in 2022, 2023 must be submitted by stomatologist for certification. In 2025 and subsequent years, at least 50 CPD points for each previous year must be submitted for certification. All 10 types of professional activities from the criteria for awarding CPD points are described. CPD points are awarded for obtaining formal, informal (type 1) and informal (type 2) education in the field of healthcare. The biggest number of points (namely, 100 CPD points) can be awarded to a stomatologist for obtaining educational and scientific levels of higher education in the field of knowledge “Health Care” (Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science). The smallest number of points, namely three CPD points, can be obtained for a professional medical internship in Ukraine outside the institution where the employee works. Modern Ukrainian legislation provides ample opportunities for doctors-stomatologists and maxillofacial surgeons for their CPD and certification. The criteria for awarding CPD points from Order No. 446 contain a complete list of educational opportunities in Ukraine and in other countries.

Various studies state that arithmetic, geometry, and measurement are three mathematical disciplines that must be prioritized in early childhood education. This research aims to determine the effect of the Somatic, Auditory, Visual, and Intellectual (SAVI) learning model on the geometric abilities of children aged 5-6 years. This research uses a pre-experimental experimental method with a one-group pretest-posttest design. The sample in this study was 18 children aged 5-6 years old Harapan Bunda Kindergarten Pancung Sol Pesisir Selatan. Data collection was obtained from observation and documentation, then the data was analyzed using paired sample tests. The results obtained in this research are that the SAVI model can improve the geometric abilities of children aged 5-6 years. This is known from the results of the paired sample t-test, which obtained a significance value of 0.000 < 0.05, which means Ho is rejected and Ha is accepted so that children's initial mathematical abilities, geometry, increase through the SAVI learning model. Children may become actively involved in their education with the help of the SAVI learning model, particularly when it comes to teaching them geometric forms. Because the teacher may utilize real items to aid in learning, children can recognize and retain the geometric forms around them as they grow older.

e72a481f1dab83bb3542187b58e7910cb8361faf,Strategic Deployment of CCUS in China: Aiming for Carbon Neutrality in Key Industries,"
 This study assesses China's CCUS deployment, pivotal for the nation's carbon neutrality by 2060 and transition to sustainable energy. It explores the social, economic, and industrial impacts, including job creation, product exports, and global CCUS market influence. The paper outlines critical goals for successful CCUS implementation, impacting China's future industrial competitiveness. We employed machine learning to analyze CO2 emissions data from China's power, iron and steel, cement, and oil and gas industries, supplemented by expert consultations. Our findings reveal significant emission characteristics: thermal power dominates the power industry's emissions, contributing over 50% to China's industrial total. The iron and steel sector accounts for over 60% of global emissions in its field, comprising 15-18% of China's emissions. Cement production, with a CO2 emission factor of 0.86, results in approximately 620 kg of CO2 per ton. The oil and gas sector, particularly petrochemicals, represents 9% of national emissions. These insights shape our analysis of the CCUS development pathway in these key sectors. Our analysis of carbon emissions and CCUS development in key Chinese industries, informed by expert consultation, leads to these conclusions: China's CCUS evolution follows three stages. The research, development, and demonstration phase (2020-2025) anticipates CCUS projects scaling to 15 Mt CO2/year. The industrial rollout phase (2025-2035) projects expansion to 50 Mt CO2/year. Full deployment (2035-2050) will see project sizes reaching 1500 Mt CO2/year, with significant milestones of 500 Mt in 2040 and 1500 Mt by 2050. Under an aggressive model, CCUS plays a crucial role in direct emission reductions, targeting 2.5 billion tonnes CO2 by 2050. Regional CCUS strategies align with each province's carbon peak goals, sequestration resources, and industrial structures. Aligned with China's 14th Five-Year Plan, our study underscores the strategic importance of CCUS technology, analyzing its potential and affordability in major sectors like electricity, iron and steel, cement, and oil and gas. We propose a CCUS deployment roadmap for China, detailing strategies for large-scale emission source retrofitting and industry-level source-sink matching. This forms the foundation for the Ministry of Science and Technology's planning of regional CCUS clusters.","Day 2 Wed, May 08, 2024",2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2118/219388-ms?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2118/219388-ms, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

899c22ac1400f7730628d190aa3c22990d5d5d36,Mentoring Millennials.,"The surgical case was straightforward: a young man had experienced a radial nerve injury from a broken humerus, now without neurological recovery. Tendon transfers to restore wrist and finger extension were planned. The surgeon, resident, and medical student approached the scrub sink together to review major teaching points, potential pitfalls, and contingency plans in case of complications. As the surgeon reached for a scrub brush, the medical student lingered back, his thumbs incessantly and rhythmically tapping on the screen of his phone. The surgeon peered at him with frustration, annoyed that again his student appeared more interested in his smartphone than the pathology. In an effort to engage him back to the case, the surgeon asked: “Can you tell me what tendons lie in each of the extensor compartments in the hand?” The student’s head snapped up, and he quickly rattled off the answer with ease. Smiling momentarily, he then asked, “Could I get your thoughts on this new video describing nerve transfers rather than tendon transfers for radial nerve injuries that was just uploaded to our educational portal? See, I have it pulled up right here, it was just presented last week at the plenary session...” Generational diversity describes the shared perspectives and experiences among individuals born within boundaries of time, such as the silent generation (19251945), the baby boomers (1946-1964), and Generation X (1965-1980).1 Individuals entering medicine today were born between 1980 and 2000, termed millennials. Millennials comprise about 25% of today’s workforce and will account for 40% and 75% of the workforce in 2020 and 2025, respectively. We recognize that these assertions do not apply to every member of a particular generation. Nevertheless, the values, expectations, and ethos that define millennials are perceived as substantially different from their predecessors and have caught the attention, and concern, of older generations. This is particularly true in medicine where training, advancement, and mentorship are steeped in tradition and where change often comes slowly. Millennials have been shaped by a profound expansion of information technology, enhanced social networking, and a connected global culture. Although sometimes labeled as impatient, distracted, overly socialized, and entitled, millennials could also be characterized as deeply empowered, collaborative, and innovative. These generalizations, however, can lead to conflict and misunderstanding, particularly in environments such as hospitals where apprenticeship and hierarchy are the norm. Mentorship is the cornerstone of academic medicine. A mentor is defined as an advisor characterized by altruism, expertise, patience, and experience. In many ways, graduate medical education has adapted to millennials through the expansion of online and videobased learning resources, disease-based educational curricula, abbreviated work hours, and team-based care models.2 However, mentorship strategies for millennial faculty members, residents, and medical students are not well understood. Indeed, we have personally witnessed generational differences leading to frustration, miscommunication, and attrition in these mentormentee dyads. Consider 3 common scenarios. Example 1. Susan is a junior faculty member drafting her career development award with her division chief, Mary, as primary mentor. Their offices are in close proximity; Susan often drops in throughout the day between Mary’s meetings to ask questions on the wording. Mary finds this irritating, as it circumvents the usual scheduling channels. Susan is annoyed that Mary seems to have little time for her. Theme 1. As Needed vs Scheduled Engagement. Millennials have grown up with virtually instant communication and information dissemination. Such engagement facilitates quick decision making and expands collaboration networks. Millennials expect accessibility, fast responses, rapid turnaround, and frequent short meetings to ensure clear direction. Senior mentors often balance administrative, clinical, and academic demands with greater structure and less ad hoc availability. Combined, this leads to frustration and stress for both parties. Example 2. John is a third-year medical student conducting a summer project examining the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques on cardiovascular risk in patients following myocardial infarction. He has a question about the survey data collection and sends a group email to Sam, a junior faculty member directly supervising the project, and to Mark, the chairman of the department who will serve as a senior author on the project. Mark is annoyed that Sam isn’t taking care of the question; Sam is embarrassed that John emailed the chair directly, and John is frustrated that no one appears to be answering his question. Theme 2. Flat vs Pyramidal Infrastructure. Millennials embrace collaboration and cognitive diversity more readily than prior generations.3 In some aspects of academic medicine, these attributes will serve them well. For example, team science, multidisciplinary care, and collective leadership are welcomed by millennials who embrace groupthink, in contrast to their senior counterparts. However, flattening social and hierarchical gaps may also lead to conflict. Millennials do not necessarily embrace the siloed communication typical of traditional academic departments. Removing these barriers can cause frustration among older physicians accustomed to hierarchical communication channels and younger physicians who desire broad access to all stakeholders. Example 3.

67bf37bf0435924f400b4157fc1353c40e1826c7,Using Ensemble Learning Algorithms to Predict Student Failure and Enabling Customized Educational Paths,"One of the challenges in e-learning is the customization of the learning environment to avoid learners’ failures. This paper proposes a Stacked Generalization for Failure Prediction (SGFP) model to improve students’ results. The SGFP model mixes three ensemble learning classifiers, namely, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine (XGB), and Random Forest (RF), using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). In fact, the model relies on high-quality training and testing datasets that are collected automatically from the analytic reports of the Blackboard Learning Management System (i.e., analytic for learn (A4L) and full grade center (FGC) modules. The SGFP algorithm was validated using heterogeneous data reflecting students’ interactivity degrees, educational performance, and skills. The main output of SGFP is a classification of students into three performance-based classes (class A: above average, class B: average, class C: below average). To avoid failures, the SGFP model uses the Blackboard Adaptive Release tool to design three learning paths where students have to follow automatically according to the class they belong to. The SGFP model was compared to base classifiers (LGBM, XGB, and RF). The results show that the mean and median accuracies of SGFP are higher. Moreover, it correctly identified students’ classifications with a sensitivity average of 97.3% and a precision average of 97.2%. Furthermore, SGFP had the highest F1-score of 97.1%. In addition, the used meta-classifier MLP has more accuracy than other Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms, with an average of 97.3%. Once learned, tested, and validated, SGFP was applied to students before the end of the first semester of the 2020-2021 academic year at the College of Computer Sciences at Umm al-Qura University. The findings showed a significant increase in student success rates (98.86%). The drop rate declines from 12% to 1.14% for students in class C, for whom more customized assessment steps and materials are provided. SGFP outcomes may be beneficial for higher educational institutions within fully online or blended learning schemas to reduce the failure rate and improve the performance of program curriculum outcomes, especially in pandemic situations.",Scientific Programming,2022.0,21,"{'url': 'https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/sp/2022/3805235.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1155/2022/3805235?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/3805235, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

030694b4903b1a9872a9ff9fbbed27fe0fbfdd50,Effectiveness of vitamin D2 compared with vitamin D3 replacement therapy in a primary healthcare setting: a retrospective cohort study,"Introduction: Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide public health concern, which can lead to severe diseases, such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Most studies have compared equimolar unit-to-unit doses of vitamin D2 and D3. Objectives: The current study aimed to answer the research question: “How effective is vitamin D2 (600,000 U/1.5 ml) compared to vitamin D3 (300,000 U/1 ml) parenteral supplementation for raising serum vitamin D levels in adult patients treated in a primary health care setting?” Setting: Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) runs 28 health centers distributed throughout the State of Qatar and its capital city, Doha. Qatar is on the east coast of the Arabic peninsula, with very hot and sunny summers and a desert climate. Study design: This was a retrospective observational cohort study. Method: A total of 15,716 participants were recruited following ethical approval. They were identified by electronic medical records (EMR) describing the clinical encounters of individuals aged 18 to 60-years-old who attended a health center operated by the PHCC during the 3.5-year study period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020. The PHCC EMR system uses SNOMED codes (a systematically organized computer-processable collection of medical terms providing codes, names, synonyms, and definitions implemented for clinical documentation and reporting). Four study groups were created depending on the type of vitamin D injection and the oral form of replacement therapy. The analysis scheme used the serum vitamin D level within the preceding 4 weeks (pretreatment), followed by administration of the treatment dose. The post-treatment serum testing value should have been available within a maximum of 12 weeks. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBMSPSS; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) version 23 software was used for the statistical analysis. Results: Four treatment options were compared, including a vitamin D2 injection, a vitamin D3 injection, combined use of a vitamin D2 injection + a D2 tablet, and combined use of a vitamin D3 injection + a D2 tablet. All four treatment groups were associated with a statistically significant increase in serum vitamin D within a maximum of 12 weeks of follow-up. The vitamin D2 injection alone was associated with the lowest increase in serum concentration by a mean of 3.2 ng/ml. In contrast, the vitamin D3 injection alone or with a D2 tablet increased serum vitamin D by 6.1 and 5.6 ng/ml, respectively. Using the combination of a vitamin D2 injection and a tablet only added a marginal increase of 2.3 ng/ml in serum vitamin D on top of the 3.2 ng/ml increase attained after administering the D2 injection alone.

9b829d37ebbb84b873fa8981942711b148fb53f3,Do reduced water and nitrogen input in rice production necessarily reduce yield?,"Rice is an essential staple food crop for more than half of the world’s population (Xiong et al., 2013). China is the leading rice producer worldwide, and rice plays an important role in China’s grain production. Moreover, over 65% of China’s population consumes rice as their staple food (Zhang et al., 2005). Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient in crop growth and plays a decisive role in ensuring a high and stable crop yield (Erisman et al., 2008). Currently, the average N application rate for rice in China is 180 kg ha (Peng et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2021). However, the N application rate reaches 350 kg ha in the high-yield Taihu Lake area (Jiao et al., 2018). The past two decades have witnessed increased N fertilizer use, promoting essential rice yield growth in China. Unfortunately, the excessive N input has also caused water eutrophication, soil acidification, reduced rice production efficiency, and other adverse effects (Xia et al., 2016; Townsend et al., 2003). Minimizing N application while avoiding yield reduction is thus a research hot spot in China. Taking into account the disadvantages of predominantly applying base fertilizer and low-efficiency tiller fertilizer in traditional rice production (Ling et al., 2014), most agricultural scientists and technological workers promote the split application of N fertilizer based on leaf age (Ling et al., 1983), site-specific N management based on soil testing (Roland et al., 2019; Ling et al., 2005), real-time N management based on the © 2022 Institute of Agrophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences CHUANHAI SHU et al. 48 relationship between leaf colour and N content (Mohanty et al., 2021), and computer-assisted model optimization to guide fertilization policy (Baral et al., 2021; Sharma S., 2019; Pan et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2002; Angus et al., 1996). These systems have greatly contributed to reduced N use and increased rice yield. Existing studies have shown that improvements in N application methods have more potential than the optimization of the N application rate to further increase rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) (Yang et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2015). Increasing the number of N applications in paddy fields from 3 to 4 and 6 to 7 times can notably enhance NUE and achieve the goal of reducing N without affecting the yield. Nevertheless, increasing the frequency of N application can also add to operational costs and induce high water supply requirements, this has limited the promotion of low-intensity/high-frequency N application (Yang et al., 2020; Ohnishi et al., 1999). Rice requires more water than any other cereal grain, it accounts for approximately 60-70% of agricultural water use (Pan et al., 2017) and 50% of domestic water consumption. With increasing demands for industrial water and water for both urban and rural residents, the proportion of water allocated to rice production decreases each year. Therefore, researchers have also conducted many water-saving irrigation studies (Tabbal et al., 2002; Belder et al., 2004), including the application of alternate wetting and drying irrigation (AWD) and controlled irrigation (CI) technologies. AWD is a water management technique that employs periodic drying and rehydration to reduce water consumption during the rice-growing season (Wang et al., 2016). Most studies propose that AWD can be used to enhance rice yield (Christy et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2017; Carrijo et al., 2018); however, a reduced yield has also been reported. These inconsistent findings may be related to soil water potential, quality, and pH (Carrijo et al., 2017). Compared with AWD, CI involves the application of more rigid water management techniques (Peng, 2009; Yu et al., 2002). After the rice seedlings have been transplanted, the field surface retains a thin 5-25 mm layer of water to allow the rice seedlings to recover from transplantation stress. However, there is no water layer on the field surface during the stages of growth after recovery. The effectiveness of irrigation is determined by taking the soil moisture of the root layer as the control index. The lower limit of soil moisture at different rice growth stages is 60-80% of the saturated moisture content of the soil, while the upper limit is at the point of soil saturation. This technique, which can be used to promote the migration of N from surface water to soil and increase the water and nutrient uptake of rice plants (Peng et al., 2009), is popular in areas prone to water shortages such as Ningxia, Jiangsu, and Heilongjiang (Peng et al., 2011). Due to its huge water requirements, rice has a more significant water-fertilizer coupling effect than that of other crops, which necessitates human regulation. Hence, research concerning water-fertilizer coupling in paddy fields has attracted much academic attention (Liu, 2019; Lin et al., 2016). With the large-scale construction of highstandard farmlands and the rapidly increasing availability of low-cost water and fertilizer integration facilities, lowintensity/high-frequency N application in paddy fields has overcome its previous limitations. The three “uniform” technique is an integrated water and fertilizer technology developed to meet the water and N requirements of rice in paddy fields, with “uniform nitrogen application (UN)” and “uniform water with fertilizer application” at its core (Yang et al., 2020). This technology allows for greatly reduced N and water use in rice production, but few studies have focused on the mechanism of action underlying these savings. In order to fill this gap, UN was studied (low-intensity/ high-frequency N application) which employed integrated water and fertilizer technology to explore the impact of water and N management on rice yield and the utilization of water and N. This study aimed to provide theoretical and technical support for high-yield practices and the efficient utilization of resources in rice production. MATERIALS AND METHODS The experimental sites were located at the experimental farm of the Rice Research Institute of Sichuan Agricultural University (Wenjiang District, Chengdu City, Sichuan Province; 30°43’N, 103°47’E) and also at the experimental farm of the Southwest University of Science and Technology (Fucheng District, Mianyang City, Sichuan Province; 31°32’N, 104°41’E). The Wenjiang site was located in the Chengdu Plain, a subtropical humid monsoon climate zone, with abundant precipitation, less sunshine, and relatively minor diurnal temperature differences. The Fucheng site was located west of the Sichuan Basin, in the north subtropical humid monsoon mountain climate zone, with uneven precipitation distribution, sufficient sunshine, and large temperature differences occurring between day and night. In addition, drought frequently occurs during the rice season of this region. In 2016, field experiments were conducted at both sites (experiments 1 and 2). A third field experiment (experiment 3) was performed at the Wenjiang site in 2017. The nutrient content of the soil at the two experimental sites is listed in Table 1. The Wenjiang site had fine sandy loam soil, whereas the Fucheng site had clay loam soil. Indica hybrid rice F-you 498 was used as the testing material. This variety is a three-line super hybrid Indica rice planted in a large area in Sichuan in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. REDUCED WATER AND NITROGEN INPUT IN RICE PRODUCTION NOT REDUCE YIELD 49 All three experimental designs were identical: a randomized block experiment involving two factors. The primary block was water management, which was divided into flooding irrigation (FI) and controlled irrigation (CI). In FI, after the rice was transplanted, a 1-3 cm water layer was always maintained above the surface of the paddy fields and dried naturally a week before harvesting. In CI, transplantation was conducted in shallow water (~1 cm), a 2 cm water layer was maintained in the fields for 5-7 days after transplanting to ensure that the seedlings turned green and survived. Subsequently, the surface water was drained and soil moisture of 70-80% was maintained before the booting stage. The fields were dried during the ineffective tillering stage, a 1-3 cm water layer was maintained above the soil surface during the booting stage, and alternate wetting and drying irrigation was implemented from heading to maturity (i.e., irrigated with 1-3 cm layer of water and dried naturally to achieve a soil water potential of -25 kPa). The secondary block was N management, which was divided into CK, farmers’ usual nitrogen management (FU), optimized nitrogen treatment (ONT), and uniform nitrogen application (UN). In FU, 150 kg ha of N fertilizer was applied according to the ratio of base fertilizer:tillering fertilizer = 7:3, one day before and seven days after transplanting. In ONT, 150 kg ha of N fertilizer was applied according to the ratio of base fertilizer:tillering fertilizer:panicle fertilizer = 3:3:4, one day before and seven days after transplanting, and at the reciprocal fourth and second leaf stages (the panicle fertilizer was divided into two equal portions). In UN, 15, 15, 30, 15, 15, 15, and 15 kg (total 120 kg ha) of N fertilizer were applied at 7, 14, 35, 49, 56, 70, and 77 days after transplanting. There were 24 blocks in total, and each treatment was repeated three times. The plot area was 12 m (3 × 4 m), and the seedlings were transplanted at a hill spacing of 33.3 × 16.7 cm. There were 216 seedlings (12 rows and 18 seedlings per row) in each plot, and the planting density was 18 plants m. The extent of the irrigation was measured using a water meter, and all other field management practices were identical. Light interception (LI): During the heading stage and 10, 20, and 30 days after the heading stage, the effective solar radiation at the top (30 cm above the flag leaf tip) and base (10 cm from the ground) of the plant were measured using an Li-191 lig",International Agrophysics,2022.0,2,"{'url': 'http://www.international-agrophysics.org/pdf-146934-73094?filename=Do reduced water and.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31545/intagr/146934?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31545/intagr/146934, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

34a91e6b2be6e5d17feeac7305b96f13bf5f1358,ICT-Medical convergence patient transfer assistant robot system,"Purpose With the rapid increase of the elderly, the demand for rehabilitation, disease prevention, and care services is increasing, and the need for caring robots is emerging to solve the problem of insufficient caring manpower. As a result of surveying 120 care workers, 63.8% of care workers lift and move patients every day, and as a result, 39.2% have musculoskeletal disorders. (Kyunghee University 2019). In this study, rehabilitation and care products were reviewed, and a “patient transport assistant robot” was developed to reduce the burden on the musculoskeletal system and provide safety and comfort to the patient, and the research results are presented. Method Dual arm assistant robot is designed to control with little force by applying counterbalance mechanism (CBM), called a passive gravity compensator (1,3). The smart sling was developed by applying the pneumatic growing mechanism, and it was possible to minimize the labor input of the caregivers by automating the sling insertion and retraction process while maintaining safety and comfort (2). Sensing and control technology is applied to enable intuitive control and two-degree-of-freedom electric driving and to prevent obstacle collisions. A small computer, Raspberry, was installed and Node-RED programming was used for system control and patient data base management. Results and Discussion In this study, rehabilitation and care products for the elderly were introduced and “patient transfer assistant robot” applying ICT technology was developed and the results were reviewed. As result proposed CBM-equipped mobile robot arm showed the torque reduction rates of 61~72% (1). The sling insertion time was 52.5(second), the robot's elevating time was 20 (seconds) and we checked it was improved data compared with present similar product. The research results of this R&D prototype reducing the physical burden of caregivers are presented by H.R. Shin (kyunghee univ). Purpose The care robots including transfer assistive robots have been developed to solve the shortage of health care workers has arisen by reducing their workload. The task of transferring and lifting older adults in facilities and hospitals is known to demanding physical work and it might be caused a musculoskeletal injury (Davis & Kotowski, 2015; Santaguida et al., 2005). Various transfer assistive equipment and devices have been developed including mechanical lifts and powered or robotic systems. However, not many equipment and devices were used in the Korean market due to inconvenience and dissatisfaction (Kim et al, 2022). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the transfer assistive robot based on the objective and subjective health care workers’ health and perceptions in long-term care facilities and hospitals to provide a solution for labor shortage issues. Method Fifteen health care workers (long-term care workers) from long-term care facilities (n=15) and fifteen health care workers (nurses, nurse assistants, paid caregivers, and transferring assistants) from integrated nursing care service hospitals. (n=15) participated in the evaluation of the smart transfer assistive robot. We recruited those who physically transferred older adults or patients as their jobs over the 1 year. Our measurements are RPE (Rating of Perceived Exertion), NASA-TLX (NASA Task Load Index), and usability items including satisfaction, manipulability, and stability. Results and Discussion We found out the smart transfer assistive robot with dual arms had a better score with RPE, NASA-TLX, satisfaction, manipulability, and stability than the manual which means health care workers conducted transferring work with dummy without robots. The findings provide that the transfer assistive robots could be the solution to decrease the care work burden and increase the health of health care workers. Purpose In order for the elderly to live a healthier and higher quality of life, balanced nutrition is a very important factor. The age-friendly food in Korea is divided into three stages (Step 1: Intake of teeth, Step 2: Intake of gums, Step 3: Intake of tongue) from a food tech perspective. The purpose of this study was to conduct sensory tests after consuming fruits according to function for the elderly in a nursing hospital with chewing and swallowing dysfunction, an appropriate fruit recipe and serving guidelines were developed. Method Fruits were served to a total of 35 elderly people according to their swallowing and chewing functions. The evaluation items were appropriateness of one serving portion and fruit preference (appearance, color, taste, aroma, flavor, aftertaste, texture, overall preference), recommendation intention, adequacy (convenience, safety (size, chewing, swallowing). Each item was evaluated on a 5-point scale and reflected in the results. (5 points: very much like, 4 points: good, 3 points: neither like nor dislike, 2 points: dislike, 1 point: very dislike) was tested. Results and Discussion We found that fruit recipes with gelling agents were more preferred depending on the type of fruit, contrary to the expectation that soft fruit would have a high intake preference. Locust bean gum, xanthan gum and carrageenan were used as gelling agents, and a recipe was developed with vitamin C powder added to prevent browning of fruits. It is expected that the development of safe fruit recipes for the elderly with swallowing and chewing dysfunction will help the elderly to satisfy their eating needs and balanced nutrition. Purpose An aging population increasing all over the world, including Korea, signifies the importance of smart homes equipped with appropriate technology for the safety and health of older adults. The percentage of people over 65 years old worldwide is expected to increase to 18.6% by 2067 from 9.1% in 2019. The situation in Korea is urgent—14.9% in 2019 to 46.5% in 2067 (Statistics Korea, 2019). The market for smart homes also grows: In Korea that market was expected to increase from 20.6 trillion won in 2020 to 22.3 trillion won in 2021 (National Information Society Agency, 2021). The worldwide smart home market was expected to grow to 123 billion dollars in 2021 (Strategy Analytics, 2021). Well-designed smart homes can increase the desire of older adults to age in place as well as bring economic benefits to the country by reducing budgets for care providers. Older adults can reside at home safely with health-, convenience-, and leisure-related smart home services. Thus, reviewing trends in international research on smart homes for older adults is a timely endeavor. The purpose of this research was to use bibliometric and scientometric analysis to investigate trends in international research on smart homes for older adults. Method This analysis method is appropriate at comprehensive “understanding and the evaluation of the literature in a given field” (Zhao et al., 2019, p. 3). We used the Web of Science Core Collection database, searching keywords “smart home*” “home automation,” or “domotics” with terms related to older adults, resulting in a total of 1,408 documents. Data were analyzed in terms of frequency of country, organization, research area, most productive authors, and most cited documents. We conducted keyword co-occurrence and document co-citation analysis using VOS Viewer software. Results and Discussion The results showed that research on smart homes for older adults appeared from 1998 and increased steadily with a burst from 2015 forward. Countries most active in publication were the United States, China, and France in that order with South Korea in eighth place. The main research areas included computer science, engineering, and telecommunications; areas related to housing design were minimal as were environmental science ecology (21 publications), architecture (5), and art (2). Co-occurrence analysis showed that international studies on smart homes for older adults can be categorized as follows: (a) older adults and living venue, (b) technology for daily activity detection, (c) elements of smart home technology, and (d) disease and health status related to older adults. Co-citation analysis showed that core literature can be categorized as follows: (a) elements of smart home technology, (b) factors for the acceptance of smart technology by older adults, (c) the future and challenges of smart homes, and (d) ambient assisted living healthcare. The research shows that studies on smart homes for older adult have increased steadily with particular growth from 2015. The main research areas were technical fields, such as computer science and engineering, with minimal research in the humanities, social sciences, and design, indicating the necessity to expand research from a human-centered diverse perspective.",Gerontechnology,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://journal.gerontechnology.org/addCount.aspx?aid=3079&download=a0e656eaa0f94417a9d160fffd4d312e.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4017/gt.2022.21.s.774.sp7?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4017/gt.2022.21.s.774.sp7, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9df3c72454a5c5351455057f1ea3f1276c6b62a7,Introduction: Processes and Palaeo-Environmental Changes in the Arctic from Past to Present (PalaeoArc) special issue,"PalaeoArc (Processes and Palaeo-Environmental Changes in the Arctic: From Past to Present) is an international network research programme, the aim of which is to understand and explain the climatically induced environmental changes in the Arctic that have taken place throughout the Quaternary and continue in the present-day (see http://www.palaeoarc.no/). This network builds on and extends the impressive legacy of previous palaeo-Arctic network programs and projects extending back to the 1980s. This began with the “Polar North Atlantic Margins—Late Cenozoic Evolution” project (PONAM: 1990–1994; Hjort and Persson 1994; Landvik and Salvigsen 1995; Elverhøi et al. 1998), which was followed by the “Quaternary Environment of the Eurasian North” project (QUEEN: 1996–2002; e.g., Larsen, Funder, and Thiede 1999; Thiede et al. 2001, 2004; Kjær et al. 2006). These were then followed by the “Arctic Palaeoclimate and Its Extremes” project (APEX: 2004–2012; Jakobsson et al. 2008, 2010, 2014) and the “Palaeo-Arctic Spatial and Temporal Gateways” project (PAST Gateways: 2012–2018; Ó Cofaigh et al. 2016, 2018). The latest incarnation of the network—PalaeoArc— was conceived at the final meeting of the PAST Gateways project in Durham, UK, in April 2019, when a new international steering committee was appointed to organize a series of activities and annual conferences for the following six years (2019–2024). The new international network held its first meeting in Poznań (20– 24 May 2019), hosted by the Faculty of Geographical and Geological Sciences, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań (see Lyså et al. 2019), comprising the usual mix of talks, posters, discussions, workshops, and a field excursion. The network planned to organize a conference hosted by the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Pisa in May 2020, but this had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was eventually held online in May 2021, endorsed by the International Arctic Science Council, Italian Geological Society, and Italian Association for the Study of the Quaternary. The meeting proved incredibly popular and was “attended” by over 250 Arctic scientists from twenty-six different countries over a four-day period, allowing glacial and marine geologists, palaeoceanographers, palaeoecologists, and specialists in permafrost and numerical modeling to discuss records of Arctic environmental change over decadal to millennial timescales. The collection of articles in this special issue stems from this second PalaeoArc International Conference and encompasses the diverse range of topics presented at the meeting, each of which addresses the overarching aims of PalaeoArc (detailed below). The third international PalaeoArc conference took place (in person) in Rovaniemi in August 2022. The network has been extended for a year, with further meetings planned in Akureyri (2023), Stockholm (2024), and Tromsø (2025).","Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research",2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15230430.2022.2154985?needAccess=true&role=button', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/15230430.2022.2154985?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2022.2154985, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A total of 180 adolescents from grades one to five were involved in this study. This research utilizes quantitative approaches, with data obtained by questionnaire distribution. SPSS Version 26 was used to analyse data received from 180 respondents via questionnaires. According to the findings of a Pearson correlation analysis, there is a significant relationship between school students' resilience and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Meanwhile, the T -Test revealed that throughout the pandemic, there was a substantial mean difference in stress levels between male and female students aged 13 to 19. Finally, the study's findings have significant implications for parents, schools, and policymakers in terms of empowering adolescents to manage stress. Future study suggestions are also encouraged. Keyword: Stress, Resiliency, Students, COVID-19, Secondary School Introduction Due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, students, particularly teenagers, have had to adapt to new online learning patterns such as the Home Learning and Teaching Process (PdPDR). Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the administration of public tests, specifically the School Achievement Test. This year, the Primary (UPSR) and Form Three Assessment (PT3) had to be cancelled. Other general exams, such as Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM), Sijil Vokasional Malaysia (SVM), Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia (STPM), and Sijil Tinggi Agama Malaysia (STAM), have been postponed until the following year. Adolescent or students who are stated to be in the process of gaining resilience may experience stress as a result of such big changes. Students may feel lonely when using online learning methods, especially during movement control periods. According to Zaiton and Balan (2014)'s research, there is a negative relationship between self-resilience and self-loneliness among IPT students (r = 0.166). Only the emotional resilience construct, as opposed to the other three International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 2 , No. 1, 2022, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2022 HRMARS 868 constructions, self-strength resilience, self-management resilience, and optimistic resilience, exhibited a significant adverse correlation with loneliness. The Morales-Rodrguez (2021) study found that university students aged 18 to 25 in Spain were in a poor level of resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic epidemic, with the greatest resilience score for the study group being only 98 points. Furthermore, the findings of the study indicate the existence of a significant correlation between resilience and coping strategies. According to Sundarasen et al (2020), the results of Chi-Square Test analysis revealed that during the period of the Movement Control Order, demographic variables such as gender, age, ethnic group, type of university, field of study, and accommodation (living arrangement) showed a significant relationship at the significance level of 0.25 percent (PKP). Meanwhile, regression analysis revealed a strong association between high levels of anxiety and female gender, age under 18, age between 19 and 25 years, pre-university education level, field of management studies, and living alone . Furthermore, the findings of this study revealed that adolescents aged 17 to 18 years old experienced high levels of anxiety during the period of the study. Malaysian researcher namely Amran & Jamaludin (2021) revealed that adolescents faced four main themes of experience during the COVID-19 pandemic: Alteration of sleep patterns, stress-related fatigue, dysfunctional eating patterns and lack of physical activity. This firsthand experience shows that knowledge and skills of adolescents' behavioral practices during outbreak deserves attention. Most children who participate in online learning are given computers or smartphones by their parents to make it easier for them to access the material. However, it has negative consequences, as a study by Hilwa, Nur Farah Jasmeen and Daniella Maryam (2020) discovered that adolescents' sleep patterns are readily disrupted, even if they are already addicted to cellphones. Adolescents must be resilient in this situation. Given the mild findings of a study on teenagers in protective institution by Sukor, Nur Saadah, and Ezarina (2019), this situation is concerning. However, what about students' stress and resilience levels throughout this COVI19 pandemic season? Enba et al (2021) found that students were psychologically influenced and displayed depression symptoms. As a result, it is vital to conduct study after study in order to secure the well-being of today's students. Method Design Researchers used a quantitative cross-sectional survey design (cross-sectional survey) in this study. Chua (2011) defines survey research as a non-experimental research technique in which information on the study subject is collected via a questionnaire form. Sample At this study, the researcher used a stratified random selection technique to choose a group of form 1 to 5 school children in secondary schools in the Alor Gajah region of Melaka. This study had a sample size of 180 participants.This is because no other scientific study on the measurement of teenage stress and resilience has been conducted in this district's secondary schools, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Questionnare Resiliency Scale The Questionnare contains 25 questions constructed by Wagnild and Young (1993) related to the resilience scale (RS-25) which includes two main aspects, namely personal competence International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 2 , No. 1, 2022, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2022 HRMARS 869 and acceptance of self and life. Self-reliance, perseverance, resolve, tenacity, not easily discouraged, and reasonable personalities are examples of personal competency.There were 17 questions in total for this element. Self-acceptance and life, on the other hand, relates to the ability to adapt, balance, flexibility, and a balanced outlook on life. This feature was assessed using a total of eight Wagnild and Young (1993) resilience scale questions. The 7Point Likert Measure was included in the 25-item resilience scale developed by Wagnild and Young (1993). Stess Scale This Questionnare comprises ten items relating to the Perceived Strees Scale that were created by Cohen, S. et al. (1983). The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a psychological tool that assesses a person's stress perceptions. PSS can determine the degree to which a circumstance in a person's life is considered stressful. PSS was chosen as a stress level measurement method in this study by the researcher because the questions were simple to understand. The 5 Point Likert Scale is the scale used in the PSS. Result Demography This study involved 68 (37.80%) of male respondents, and 112 (62.80%) of female respondents. A total of 30 (16.70%) of the 180 students who took part in the study, were aged 13 or older. There were 31 (17.20%) respondents age14-year-old. The number of 15year-old age group respondents was 35, (19.40%). In addition, 29 (16.10%) respondents were 16 years old when they took part in the survey. Furthermore, a total of 23 (12.80%) of the 17year-olds respondents, took part in the survey and none of the 180 responders were under the age of 18.

A total of 71 people (39.40 %) of the 180 respondents, are residents of urban regions. Meanwhile, the remaining respondents, 109 (60.60 %), live in the rural area. Apart from that, a total of 98 respondents (54.40%) belong to the B40 category, which has a total household income of less than RM4500. Meanwhile, 69 respondents (38.30%) belong to the M40 category, which has a monthly family income of RM4501 to RM10000. Only 13 respondents (7.20%) fall into the T20 category, which has a total household income of greater than RM10001. The majority of respondents (87.20%) had four to eight family members, with 157 (87.20%) having four to eight family members. Following that, 20 respondents (11.10%) hailed from families with fewer than four members. Only three people (1.70%) had more than eight relatives.

804e51a43b3e02a52449cedb7b8b5da0cf3ea4f9,Reply to: Uncertainty in near-term temperature evolution must not obscure assessments of climate mitigation benefits,"In response to our recent paper 1 (hereafter SFL20) concerning the relation between natural variability in the climate system and the time to detect a response to emissions mitigation, Lanson et al.2 (hereafter L22) call for ‘a broader debate on how to best assess and communicate emerging effects of climate mitigation in the light of natural variability’. We welcome a broader debate on this aspect of global responses to climate change, attempt to reconcile our views in the following. The scientific community should provide the best possible knowledge to policy makers and the public, while also considering their perspectives and stated needs. Applying this to the expected effects of emission mitigation in the current geophysical and political context, there are two overall approaches that can be taken. One, advocated by L22, treats quantification of this response as an exercise in detection and attribution (D&A), i.e. the statistical detection of a change relative to an expected situation and the attribution of this change to a specific cause. The other, used in SLF20 and other recent works3–5, focuses on detection of emergence, through observable, well communicated properties of the climate system such as global mean surface temperature (GMST)6. Emergence is defined as the time at which the observed signal of a change, with the influence of internal variability removed, evolves outside the range expected from this variability. L22 rightly point out that D&A of anthropogenic climate influence in the presence of natural variability is well established7–11. The technique would be crucial for communication in a situation where emissions decline while GMST keeps rising due to natural variability and the inertia of the climate system. The challenge is that it requires thorough explanation to avoid being perceived as counter to the key message of climate science: That more emissions imply higher temperature. Focusing solely on GMST evolution, as was done in SFL20, differs from this approach, by not formally utilizing decomposition of the temperature trend in terms of its underlying drivers. We emphasize that in the present situation of high emissions and a positive warming rate, mitigation of warming emissions acts to reduce future human induced climate related hazards, whether it is formally detectable or not12–14. When we still caution that we should curb our expectations for the near-term climate impacts from mitigation, it is because the focus on GMST as the sole indicator of progress in terms of the ambitions of the Paris Agreement has been made so strong in the media and public debate. In line with previous arguments15, we therefore encourage applying both perspectives. We need to be clear on how much is known about the climate system and how we affect it through anthropogenic activities and individual drivers of climate change. We also need to be clear on the magnitude of this influence, relative to natural variability, on shorter timescales such as 10 or even 5 years. L22 make an example of the so-called ‘global hiatus’ period, which has later been diagnosed in detail with D&A and other tools16, and has taught us much about energy transport through the climate system. At the time, however, communications were challenging, as GMST was the sole quantity of discussion in many fora15, even though the science of forcing and response was as established then as it is today. Such a situation can easily arise again, through either temporary lower warming rates in the presence of continued emissions, or high warming in a situation of very strong mitigation. This is well known in the scientific community, but not so well established in the public debate. In fact, both combinations can be found in the simulations used in SFL20, persisting for a decade or more. See Fig. 1, where we have picked two example realizations of temperature evolution from MAGICC617 combined with natural variability from the CESM Large Ensemble18. Through most of 2020–2030, a high-emission pathway (RCP8.5) is associated with global temperatures markedly below that of a lowemission projection (RCP2.6). For the 5-year period 2021–2025, the average difference is >0.2 °C. Both evolutions also show substantial, and statistically equivalent, multi-decadal warming trends, and approach similar warming in 2030. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31426-w OPEN",Nature Communications,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31426-w.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9283370, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f8e3433638a93f5feacbd64e4fa9bc5aefd43388,"Status of Agricultural Mechanization in Ghana: Insight from Farmers’ Perception, Population, and Nonagricultural Sector Growth","The growing human population is a driver for higher food demands with a need to scale agricultural production and maintain security of the food supply chain. Thus, there is a need to increase the adoption and improvement of mechanized systems in agriculture, especially where needed labor is also drifting into nonagricultural production sectors. With this view, the relationship or link between population and employment in nonagricultural sector in Ghana (West Africa) to agricultural mechanization was tested to ascertain any such validity. This formed the primary basis for this study and furthered on to establish the current level of agricultural mechanization within the country through measuring effect of available farm energy sources on farm sizes under cultivation. The methods employed included a structured questionnaire administered to farmers and other agricultural stakeholders to determine the level of mechanization, readiness to adopt/accept mechanization technology, level of usage of mechanization technologies, and ownership of machinery. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 20) software was used to model and analyze data obtained including a multiple regression method for the relationship between parameters. The overall level of agricultural mechanization in Ghana was found to be very low with 77.6% of the farm operations being performed manually. The level of the tractor power availability in Ghana was found to have increased from 0.0207 kW/ha in the year 2004 to 0.0588 kW/ha in the year 2020 and is expected to increase to 0.0752 kW/ha in the year 2025. The power availability valued in this study was also found to be low compared with that in other developing countries. Statistically, both employment in the service sector and population growth were significant determinants (

 ) in the variations in the level of mechanization of agriculture in Ghana and policymakers will have to make adjustments in policies to take note of these indicators most often underplayed.

41667960c43856cebeab0a06a42b16272ca91b65,Flipped Learning in Education: A Content Analysis,"Summary The continuously progressive education system of the 21st century requires the introduction of innovative teaching methodologies incorporating up-to-the-minute technology-oriented styles, which are capable of changing the traditional ways of conducting classes presenting teachers as the ultimate source of knowledge, with a new notion which considers teachers as facilitators and guiders in the world of information. A plethora of research has been conducted with respect to flipped learning, however, the number of research papers presenting content analysis is limited indicating the deficiency and lack of content analysis-based papers on Flipped Classroom in Education. Thus, to fill this gap in the literature, there is a demand for conducting a content analysis. In turn, the aim of this paper was to identify the importance and impact of the distributed documents on a Flipped Learning Model (FLM) in Education which was done by gathering data from the SCOPUS database with keywords ‘Flipped Classroom in Education’, within the range of ten years (2011-2020). All studies published in SCOPUS, were statistically analyzed and examined according to the year of publication, subject area, document type, country/territory, languages, source type, types of research and the research methods. It was found that the publications related to FLM in education had dramatically increased from the year 2011 to 2020.

The result of data interpretation provides affirmation of significant positive effect of intensive training on employees' core competence with limited specific gaps in safety issues and troubleshooting and recommending action plan to bridge such gaps. The impact of this factor resulted into 60% of core competency success Keyword: Intensive Training, Quality Assessment, Competency Models; International Petroleum Companies, Core Competence, Safety Introduction The significance of the competency model, integrated with the identification gaps has been improved since the year 2000 by understanding and abilities of the wide hydrocarbon industries. Similarly, the priority of O&G managers and employees to be competent and productive can be achieved by a competency-based development program, which understands and meets its particular task criteria for each position (Connor et al., 2014). Intensive training and quality assessment are typically based on competency approaches to identify various abilities, methods, attitudes, and knowledge gaps for effective processing. The competency model concentrates on functional and technical needs with immense courtesy of skills and knowledge required in performing a particular job (J. Connor, Mark, Casey, Karen, Eddon, , 2014) However, the smooth running of a factory requires professional abilities that can only be attained in long-term employment. According to (P. D. Walker, International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 4, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 752 Cammy, Ellis, & Seibert, 2011), the lack of operational abilities can restrict the plant’s efficiency. (Sugarindra, Suryoputro, & Novitasari, 2017) highlighted the gap in the identification of workplace hazards resulting in accidents and their main causes including the absence of understanding and abilities during new technology processing. Additionally, compliance with health, safety and environment (HSE) instructions and regulations is an important component in the mitigating or removal of accidents; because otherwise, staff refers to events in the absence of attention to security processes, hence risk evaluation plays a crucial role in the HSE system (Aven, 2016). Organizational deficiencies and skills gaps in plant operations have affected the O&G sector in the Yemen republic. The absence of long-term strategic planning to reduce deficiencies led to the instability of the Business World (WorldBank, 2015) Yemen has less than 50% of its complete human capital potential in the World Economic Forum, which measures the gaps in the nation’s economies and optimizing their potential as human capital through schooling and skills development World Economic (Leopold, Ratcheva, & Zahidi, 2017). According to Gannah Hunt's operations engineer, stated that troubleshooting, plant shutdown, human errors, damaged properties, and presence of a gap in knowledge, skills, and behavior among Yemeni operators and technicians are the root causes of inadequate training and evaluation (Ali et al., 2020) In the recent conferences of Chevron's industry specialists and the University of Houston Energy, preparing future leaders in the energy sector has been discussed. John Colborn, director of “Skills for America’s Future, found discontinuation among higher education institutions and businesses. He revealed that while the university students consider that they are fully prepared for the job, the employees would say no (Jones|, 2015) . Therefore, intensive training represent in field technical training, health, safety and environment training, advance specific training, and quality assessment in stages is required to meet international standard of oil and gas companies Components in Major Oil Companies The competency factors outcomes of literature and industries are summarized in Table 1. The selection of most variables or factors has been made to construct a theoretical, conceptual model and achieve the current study's objectives. With the selection of intensive training, quality assessment, and motivation in attaining competent operators and technicians, I ran a preliminary study to justify selecting the above constructs, Table: 1. demonstrates the essential components of the competency framework in international major O&G companies globally. Almost all oil companies have a comparative framework related to training and assessment. However, they are distinguished in some aspects, including the training program, management policy regarding disciplinary action against failed trainees, assessment way, gap processing or treatment, career management, reporting, and computer software.

Employees' knowledge, skill, behavior, and experience are significant elements in advancing a high performance/high skill workforce to face challenges in risky operations (Figgis & Standen, 2005). (Figgis & Standen, 2005) pointed out that adhering to safety, health, and environment, delivering questions, and aspiration in learning is a decent landmark in behavior essential for O&G organizations (Figgis & Standen, 2005). Alternatively, they plan an effective training program based on initial assessments in identifying gaps and weaknesses and designing a training program for each role and position also important for O&G companies (P. D. Walker et al., 2011). The essential factor in the competency model is training, which should be aligned with trainees' needs and effectively interact with the training program. These practical trainings are efficiently suitable in gaining knowledge, skills, behavior, and experience as they are linked with the existing experience of employees and coach supervision (Matteo, 2019). However, the best topics for trainees are related to risks and safety issues, plant troubleshooting, start-up/shutdown activities, and emergency events, while the literature review did not adequately discuss this issue (Williams & Turnbull, 2015). Although technical training focuses on risk assessment and risk management to control accidents to extent limits, yet unsafe acts are risen by technicians (Al-Awai, Samir, & Binthabet, 2002; Capp, Lazarewicz, & Rojas, 2010). The priority of O&G companies is safety, sustainability, assets' observation, and employee protection. Therefore, the O&G companies designed a competency model to achieve the abovementioned goals (Blanchard, 2006). According to (P. Lee, Allen, & Daly, 2012), safety awareness is a priority in the petroleum industry. (Sahinidis & Bouris, 2008) conducted a study that linked the employee's competency and attitude with the training received. They claimed a significant relationship between the employees' competence and commitment, job satisfaction, and motivation. Alternatively, the training program objectives should be linked with the class's learning process and on-job practices in the field (Tello Rueda, 2006). To induce practical training, (Schmidt, 2007) suggested the following essential steps; a. Finding out the current competency level of employees.

23e68f709aa5b1beacc70a63bc4fe7cc3cc6f692,Comparative Study of Treosulfan Plus Fludarabine (FT14) with Busulfan Plus Fludarabine (FB4) for Acute Myeloid Leukemia in First or Second Complete Remission: An Analysis from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP),"
 Background: Treosulfan has been increasingly used in reduced toxicity regimens, especially in older or frail patients. Different doses of treosulfan plus fludarabine have shown an advantage over reduced intensity regimens, confirmed by a randomized phase 3 trial utilizing treosulfan 30 g/m² (or FT10) in the majority of patients. However, data comparing fludarabine with higher doses of treosulfan (FT14) to fludarabine combined with myeloablative doses of busulfan are limited.
 Aims: We compared outcomes between treatment alternatives of similar conditioning intensity: FT14 (fludarabine 150 or 160 mg/m 2 and treosulfan 42g/m 2, or FT14) over FB4 (fludarabine 150 or 160 mg/m 2 and busulfan 12.8 mg/kg).
 Methods: We retrospectively studied consecutive patients from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry, meeting the following inclusion criteria: a) adults diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), b) recipients of first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched unrelated or sibling donor between 2010-2020, c) HSCT at first or second complete remission (CR), d) conditioning regimen with either FT14 or FB4. Patients with ex vivo manipulated grafts were excluded. A sub-group analysis was performed according to age (<55 years or ≥55 years).
 Results: In total, 2703 patients were included in the analysis comprising 2025 (75%) transplanted with FB4, and 678 (25%) with FT14.
 In the sub-group of patients younger than 55 years (n=1676), FT14 recipients (n=236) had a significantly increased age (p<0.001), higher rates of secondary AML (p<0.0001), unrelated donors (p<0.0001), and peripheral blood grafts (p=0.026), but a lower percentage of female donors to male recipients (p=0.008), compared to FB4 recipients (n=1440). Cumulative incidence (CI) of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade III-IV was higher in FT14 (9.3% versus 5.8%, p=0.044), but rates of chronic GVHD were similar. With a median follow-up of 24.4 months (range 23.4-25.6), 2-year CI of relapse was higher in FT14 (35.9% versus 27.5%, p=0.025, Figure 1A), while non-relapse mortality was similar between groups (NRM 11.9% versus 7.7%, p=0.28, 1B). This led to lower 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS 52.2% versus 62.4%, p=0.002, 1C), overall survival (OS 63.2% versus 72.9%, p=0.038, 1D), and GVHD free, relapse free survival (GRFS 41.3% versus 50%, p=0.004) in FT14. In Cox-regression multivariate analysis, conditioning regimen remained an independent predictor of CI of relapse (p=0.011), and LFS (p=0.03).
 Similar differences in patient characteristics were observed in patients aged ≥55 years (n=1027). FT14 recipients (n=442) had a significantly increased age (p<0.001), higher rates of secondary AML (p<0.0001), unrelated donors (p<0.0001), adverse cytogenetics (p<0.0001), peripheral blood grafts (p=0.026), but a lower percentage of female to male combinations (p=0.008) compared to FB4 (n=585). Cumulative incidence (CI) of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV was higher in FT14 (7.6% versus 6.5%, p=0.001), with similar rates of chronic GVHD. Nevertheless, with a median follow-up of 29.6 months (range 23.9-34.1), 2-year CI of relapse, NRM, as well as LFS, OS and GFRS were similar between groups.
 Conclusion: With the limitations of a retrospective analysis, our large real-world multicenter study suggests that FB4 is associated with better outcomes compared to FT14 in younger patients with AML transplanted in first or second CR. The same was not true for older patients (≥55 years). It should also be noted that FT14 has been selected by treating physicians for higher risk HSCT, including patients who are older, have secondary disease, adverse cytogenetics, and unrelated donors. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the optimal conditioning regimen for such patient populations.

e681517bb37642775a2eccd09f594c9f9e8b68e8,Facilitating Advanced Manufacturing Technicians' Readiness in the Rural Economy: A Competency-based Deductive Approach,"While rural manufacturing job availability is growing throughout the country, rural communities often lack skilled workers. Thus, it is imperative for employers to validate needed new professional competencies by understanding which skills can be taught on-the-job as well as the knowledge and abilities best gained through classroom learning and experiential learning opportunities. This enhanced understanding not only benefits employers’ hiring practices, but also it can help Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs improve curricula and expand learning opportunities to best meet students’ and employers’ needs. In this study, we triangulated industry competency model content with rural employer perspectives on new advanced manufacturing (AM) professionals’ desired competencies (i.e., the level of skill sophistication in a particular AM work area). To extract competencies for entry-level AM rural jobs, we used a deductive approach with multiple methods. First, we used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract, analyze, and compare the U.S. Department of Labor’s AM 2010 and 2020 Competency Models because they reflect the levels and topics AM industry professionals nationally reported as technician needs. Then, we interviewed 10 rural AM employers in North Florida to capture their perceptions of the most important competencies for new middle-skill technicians. Interview transcripts were also processed using NLP to extract competency levels and topics; we compared this output to the AM Competency Model analysis results. We deduced that the most critical competencies identified by rural AM employers required direct classroom instruction, but there was a subset of skills obtainable through on-the-job training or other experiential learning. This study, with the goal of addressing employee shortages and increasing the number of technicians ready for the workforce, has implications for rural community colleges’ AM programs curricula and the role of experiential learning. 1.0. Introduction Manufacturing represents a greater share of private rural jobs and earnings compared to urban areas, making manufacturing essential to rural economies. Some researcher also suggest that rural manufacturing is more resilient to economic downturns and associated with higher survival rates than urban plants, likely because rural plants are often independent and not connected with multi-unit firms. For these reasons, along with benefits of lower property taxes, wages, and land prices, companies are attracted to locating manufacturing plants in rural areas. Unfortunately, while rural manufacturing jobs markets are strong, rural markets are often limited in skilled workers. Thus, it is imperative that employers can identify competencies that are needed prior to entry, those that can be taught on-the-job, and even opportunities that can be taught through experiential learning. Equipped with this knowledge, CTE programs can improve curricula to best meet the needs of students and employers, alike. In this study, we compare the competencies that AM industry professionals believe are important to entry-level technicians through document text-mining analysis of the Department of Labor’s AM competency Model (henceforth the DOL AM Competency Model) and employer interviews. We further identify the topics (i.e., nouns) and competency levels (or nouns according to Bloom’s taxonomy) that highlight lowto high-level competencies. We then use this hierarchy scheme to answer the following 2-part research question concerning AM employers in Northwest Florida: RQ 1) How do national AM competencies levels in the DOL AM Competency Model compare to competency levels expressed by Northwest Florida employers? RQ 2) What competencies most critical to rural AM employers can benefit entry-level technicians through classroom learning and experiential learning? 2.0. Literature Review 2.1. Industry Demands in DOL AM Competencies AM Competencies are developed by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the U.S. Department of Labor. Industry subject matter and technical experts provide feedback on the model and the model is validated with input from industry associations, labor organizations, educators, and other subject matter experts [1]. The ETA and partners recently updated the 2010 DOL AM Competencies [2] with the 2020 AM Competencies [3] to represent competencies across a wide range of AM industries and is mean to provide allow new AM technicians, educators, and employers to align competencies (or knowledge, skills, and abilities) to facilitate recruitment, retention, training, and developing in AM. The Summary of Changes [4] from the 2010 and 2020 models does not appear significantly different within the 10 year span, and the major topic themes or tiers are as follows: 1) Tier 1 includes Personal Effectiveness Competencies (or soft skills) which focus on interpersonal skills, integrity, professionalism, initiative, dependability and reliability, adaptability and flexibility, and lifelong learning. 2) Tier 2 includes Academic Competencies which focus on reading, writing, math, science, communication, critical and analytical thinking, and basic computer skills. 3) Tier 3 includes Workplace Competencies such as business fundamentals, teamwork, customer focus, scheduling and coordinating, creative thinking and problem solving, recording or examining information, working with tools and technology, personal health and safety, and sustainable practices that meet the needs of future generations. 4) Tier 4 are Industry-Wide Technical Competencies and include manufacturing process design and development, operations management, maintenance, installation, and repair, production in the supply chain or supply chain logistics, quality assurance, process and equipment health, safety, and environment. These Tiers are essentially building blocks of related competencies to successfully perform broad skills needed for the entire industry and not just an industry sector or occupation, also referred to as industry-wide competencies. 2.2. Experiential learning in CTE and AM Integration of experiential learning is now a requirement for funding in Florida of all programs that use Perkins V funds, a program that strengthens Career and Technical Education (CTE) in secondary and postsecondary levels in the U.S. [5, 6]. With the passing of Executive Order 1931, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis committed that Florida would chart a course for students to be prepared for Jobs of the Future and the State to rank first nationally in Workforce Education by 2030[7]. Florida’s Perkins V State Plan, in alignment with Executive Order 19-31, necessitates alignment of the secondary and postsecondary programs with the future of work and specifically “emphasizes experiential learning, a tighter and more intentional alignment to industry demand, increased access for special populations and a more innovative approach to how workforce education is structured and delivered [5].” Florida’s Experiential Learning Framework for Perkins Size, Scope, and Quality [6] defines experiential learning as providing students with opportunities for 1) work-based learning, 2) career and technical student organizations (CTSOs), or capstone experiences that engage students through formal or informal learning. Florida’s Experiential Learning Framework provides examples of work-based learning as career experiences (e.g., practicum, internships, registered apprenticeships or pre-apprenticeships, and on-the-job training), and career engagement (e.g., directed student or other capstone courses, school enterprise, service learning, simulated work environments, or participation in CTSOs. Experiential learning also includes preparation for work-based learning, which includes career exposure (e.g., job shadowing, mentoring, company tours, and informational interviews) and career exploration (e.g., career fairs, interest inventories, mock interviews, and guest speakers). Across the nation, AM and Engineering Technology (ET) programs, which fall under the prevue of CTE, have or are aligning core curricula and programs with industry needs to better prepare students to meet the demands of the AM workforce [8-10], recognizing the benefits that collegeindustry partnerships have on student learning. Some researchers [11, 12] have even developed experiential models for AM in areas of additive manufacturing and lean-thinking-learning space. While there is general enthusiasm about the integration of experiential learning in CTE programs, the process for including such activities have existed for some time [13, 14] and require a reflective learning process for students to learn [15, 16], which signifies caution for program administrators or courses instructors that integrate learning opportunities without heeding to the theoretical concepts or approaches that lead to student learning outcomes. 3.0. Method In this study, we compare competencies that AM industry professionals believe entry-level manufacturing employees should possess and compare them to national AM competencies. Competencies refers to both the level of competence in a particular topic and the topic itself. To extract competencies for entry-level AM rural jobs, we use a deductive approach and multiple methods. 3.1. Data Collection We use Natural Language Processing to review DOL’s AM Competency Model (2020) [3] and extracted the competency levels and topics that AM industry professionals nationally believe are needed by entry-level employees. Next, we interview 10 AM industry employers in rural manufacturing plants in Northwest Florida and ask them to identify the most essential competencies entry level workers should possess.",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,1,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37171.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37171?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37171, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The principle of this technology is based on the analysis of native raw unfiltered ultrasound signals, the so called radiofrequency ultrasound signals, acquired during an echographic scan of the lumbar spine and/or femoral neck. [1]. A previous published study showed a high degree of correlation between the T-score values provided by the two techniques-REMS and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry for both lumbar spine and femoral neck [2]. REMS software outputs information about BMD (g/cm2), T-scores, Z-scores [standard deviations (SD)], percentage of body fat and basal metabolic rate [BMR (kcal/daily)] [3].The aim of the current study is to investigate the multivariate significant risk factors for reduced BMD through REMS technology.In this study, a total of 273 women with mean age 62 years (yrs.) ± 12 yrs. (range 25-88 yrs.) underwent REMS assessments. Subjects were divided into two groups after acquiring information about the spinal T-scores: 1st group with T-scores ≥-1 SD and 2nd group with T-scores <-1 SD. Age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), basal metabolic rate (BMR), body fat and menopausal status were the risk factors included in the multivariate statistical analyses. Binary logistic regression was used to assess which are the significant risk factors for T-score <-1 SD. Youden’s indices were calculated for selecting the cut-off points for each risk factor.273 women had mean weight of 70.5 kg. ± 15.7 kg. (range 39.4-127 kg.), mean height 157.1 cm. ± 8.8 cm. (range 100-182 cm.) and mean body mass index (BMI) 28.6 kg/cm2 ± 6.1 kg/cm2 (range 14.9-47.5 kg/cm2). The mean body fat of the subjects was 37.8% ± 8.8% (range 9-52%) and the mean BMR was 1274.01 kcal/daily ± 163.17 kcal/daily (range 929.7-1908.4 kcal/daily). 260 women (95.2%) were attributed to postmenopausal. Age (p=0.000), BMI (p=0.015), menopause (p=0.006) and BMR (p=0.000) were the multivariate significant risk factors for T-score <-1 SD. Odds ratio for the risk factor age was 1.16, so each added year of the women’s age increased the risk for T-score <-1 SD by 1.16%. Women over the age of 65 yrs. showed the highest risk for spinal T-score <-1 SD. The odds ratio of the menopause as a risk factor for spinal T-score <-1 SD was 9.54, so postmenopausal women showed about 9.5 times higher risk of T-score <-1 SD of the lumbar spine than women who still have their period. The increase of BMI by one kg/cm2 decreased the probability of spinal T-score <-1 SD by 0.15% and the increase of BMR by one kcal/daily decreased this probability by 0.02%. Women with BMI above 28.63 kg/cm2 and those with BMR >1331.75 kcal/daily were unlikely to develop spinal T-score <-1 SD.In the current study, multivariate regression analysis was used to develop a specific REMS-based risk prediction model for spinal BMD, corresponding to T-score <-1 SD. Postmenopausal women over age of 65 yrs. with BMI lower than 28.63 kg/cm2 and BMR <1331.75 kcal/daily were at the highest risk for T-score <-1 SD of the lumbar spine.[1]Pisani P, Renna MD, Conversano F, Casciaro E, Muratore M, et al.

e0c056178b77118b1f2def15250146b1a318e4ab,The Current Status and Development Trend of Wind Power Generation,"Due to the global environmental pollution and energy crisis, the development and application of low-carbon, clean and green renewable resources has gradually been focused on and become the trend. As one of clean and green renewable resources, the development and application of wind power has attracted the attention from various countries in the world. Wind power generation is an important part, and the current status and development trend are prosperous. This paper, firstly analyzes the principle, characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of wind power generation, then elaborates its current status, and finally expects its development trend. It is hoped that this paper can play a positive role in the development of wind power generation with a certain reference value. Nowadays, with the rapid increase of global economy, the demand of people for various energy resources is also increasing. The subsistence of human being is closely related to the usage and development of energy resources, and sufficient energy resources is the necessary foundation to guarantee people’s life and work [1]. At present, global science and technology develops greatly, however, it also results in the excessive consumption of non-renewable resources, such as natural gas, petroleum, and coal. The serious environmental pollution and shortage of various energy resources have been the important problems constraining the further development of nations and regions. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to develop and make use of new energy resources, which can not only complement non-renewable resources, also effectively reduce environmental pollution and further realize the sustainable development [2] In the development of new energy resources, by virtue of high utilization, rich reserves, lower environmental requirement and short construction cycle, wind power has gradually widely applied and developed in the whole world. Besides, due to the characteristics of less pollution and emission, wind power generation has become a significant strategy to realize the sustainable development of electric energy. 1. The Principle of Wind Power Generation The principle of wind power generation is to apply the kinetic energy produced by wind power in movement to drive the vanes of windmill to rotate, and to enhance the rotational speed of windmill with corresponding booster engine, and lastly transform kinetic energy to electric energy through electromagnetic effect [3]. In terms of current wind power generation technology, the goal of power generation can be reached as long as the wind speed reaches three meters each second. To transform wind power to electric energy is one of basic methods applied in current wind power utilization. In general, wind-driven generator is mainly composed of energy storage device, empennage direction adjuster, tower, electric generator, wind wheel, etc. The wind contains giant energy. Related studies show that when the wind speed is 10 meters per second, it will have an acting force about 10kg on the surface of the object when it is about 5-level; when the wind speed is 20 meters per second, it will have an acting force about 50kg on the surface of the object when it is about 9-level; if the wind speed reaches 50 meters per second, it will become typhoon or hurricane, and it will have an acting force about 200kg [4]. Therefore, the energy of wind is much higher than the energy that currently controlled by people. The further development and utilization of wind power can bring greater convenience for people’s life and work. 2018 7th International Conference on Advanced Materials and Computer Science (ICAMCS 2018) Published by CSP © 2018 the Authors 160 2. The Characteristics of Wind Power Generation Wind power is inexhaustible, cheap, clean and energy-saving renewable resource spreading in the whole world. In 1979, a Denmark company developed the first wind turbine generator system, and successfully established the first wind turbine. According to the 12 Five-year development plan of energy resource, until 2020, wind power will become the third conventional energy resource following hydroelectricity and thermal power, and the nation will further increase the goal to 150 million KW, trying to realize the goal of 200 million KW at the same time [5]. The goal of 300 million KW and 500 million KW will be realized in 2030 and 2050 respectively. At that time, the generating capacity and install power-generating capacity will be higher than 10% and 20% respectively, which can realize the high-quality sustainable development. As for the causes, firstly, compared with nuclear power station, thermal power station and hydropower station, wind power generation has advantages of lower costs, easy operation, simple maintenance and flexible investment; secondly, wind power brings less negative impact to ecological environment and is constrained by less factors, which greatly enhance the convenience; thirdly, it has advantages of efficient income from investment, short construction cycle, easy and simple construction and less demonstration area; fourthly, faced by exhausted non-renewable resources, it is urgent to replace it with new-type energy resources, and wind power can effectively solve the problem of insufficient environmental energy resources [6]. 3. The Advantages and Disadvantages of Wind Power Generation 3.1 The advantages of wind power generation With the continuous development of market economy, wind power, as a clean energy resource, plays a significant role in China’s wind power generation. Relative wind power equipment has been further developed, so cost of production also constantly decreases. Wind power generation is renewable, without causing environmental pollution. On the one hand, it can make great contribution to the economic growth. On the other hand, it can significantly alleviate the problem of air pollution and help the energy conservation and emission reduction by virtue of gradual mature related technologies [7]. Therefore, wind power is a new-type clean renewable resources with prosperous development prospect 3.2 The disadvantages of wind power generation First of all, there is shortage of scientific and technological talents who conduct research on wind power generation, there is not sufficient capability of independent innovation, operation of infrastructure, and education on wind power generation, and many wind power generation still rely on national rewards and subsidies [8]. Secondly, relative Chinese producers do not have better technologies, depending on foreign technologies for production, with small single rated power and insufficient capabilities, so the waste of land and wind power is serious. In addition, wind power generation produces noise and occupies large land area, with instability and uncontrollability. It requires a lot in geographic location, it will have interference on birds. And the imperfect social security system and equipment also limits the further development of wind power generation [9]. 4. The Current Status of Wind Power Generation After the appearance of wind power installed capacity of 32GW in 2015, it has been falling back for two consecutive years. It is expected that the new wind power installed capacity will increase by 15% this year on year-on-year basis. The main reasons include the promotion of offshore wind power installation, the expectation of lowering electricity prices and the improvement of wind-abandoning and electricity-limiting. The launch of offshore wind power generation expands new market space for its growth; the lowering electricity price stipulates that the original electricity price shall be performed in projects constructed before the end of 2019, so developers are promoted",,2019.0,5,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.23977/icamcs.2018.029', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.23977/icamcs.2018.029?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.23977/icamcs.2018.029, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There is close association logic between VR system and modern educational technology platform and classroom, simultaneously, it also accelerates the redistribution of educational resources and promotes the realization of education fairness. Experience and interest are procedural goal of VR education pursued, but in reality, the idea of parents, teachers and students, and the development of VR hardware level and scarcity of education content hinder the development of VR education, technology and demand for talented persons will be the key for VR education development in the future. VR has the potential to become a standard tool in the field of education, and educational content can be re-created using VR technology to form a new VR education ecosystem. The deep involvement of technology and the systematic reconstruction of education have brought more diverse teaching and learning changes through the rotation. Horizon Report (2016 Higher Education Edition) regards VR technology as the key technology to resolve deep learning contradictions in the next 2-3 years. VR technology brings high immersion and fun to students, making it the most promising star technology in education after multimedia and Internet, it has largely subverted the traditional teaching methods, and deeper educational sources problem will likely be touched. 1. A New Vision of VR Technology and Education Around 2009, the era of consumption of mobile intelligent terminal devices based on traffic dividends entered a recession stage. Application technologies with more innovative concepts have spawned two major industrial innovation directions: VR and IOT, which have triggered the basic entrepreneurial and employment situation of the VR industry. 2016 was called the first year of VR industry, and huge amounts of capital poured into the VR industry. According to the forecast of the multinational investment bank Goldman Sachs Group in early 2016, the global VR market revenue scale is expected to soar to 60 billion US dollars in 2025. China's huge market capacity will make it the main force in the global VR market. The British magazine Economist wrote that China is leading the world in the VR popularization. The synergy between education and technology can change the world we live in. The popularization of VR+ education has caused students to change their understanding of learning. A Samsung survey on VR in the United States shows that 85% of teachers believe that the use of VR technology in the internet plus era can improve students' learning efficiency in teaching. The significance of education is to enhance the richness of students' life experience. The participatory learning process makes personalized education truly a reality. The VR system built on the internet has made education alive, and it has brought a new vision of education in the cultivation of artisan spirit, student scene knowledge learning and learning resources. VR has brought a new educational technology revolution. 2. The Logic of VR System and Modern Education “Internet plus” represents a new way of life, new ecological concept and new economic format.

d60a6f460bdd13c4bef271aa4b72e95187a759e5,A Sanctuary of Memory in Viet Thank Nguyen’s “Black-Eyed Women”,"Diasporic literature has always brought out the pains and tribulations of the diasporans in the settled land. It has grown far and wide in the contemporary era. Such a dynamic field of literary studies not only presents the problems of the diasporans but gives solutions to the same. This research paper is one such attempt to propose the ways in which the diasporans can relieve themselves from the pains experienced in the hostland, as embedded in Viet Thanh Nguyen’s short story “BlackEyed Women”. Keywords— Memory, diaspora, first and second generation diasporans, ghosts. Memory is the word that activates the world and ensures the existence of lives on earth. All animals and people are bestowed with memories that keep them moving on earth. Life sans memories cannot flourish as they would be computers sans CPU. In such a circumstance life would become meaningless. According to Elie Wiesel, a RomanianAmerican poet, Without memory, there is no culture Without memory, there would be No civilization, no society, no future. (Wiesel) It is quite evident that without memory, human beings would be mere mortals who would die every second if they do not remember anything. Memory also delineates the personality of a person based on the type of memory he or she has. To define memory, it can be called as the retention or recollection of incidents, happenings and every single action around people. They are information that are encoded, stored and retrieved later. Memory works based on sensory organs and every living thing possesses memory, but only the range and the capacity of it differ in everyone. Based on the range of memory, information imbued in a person can be classified into three types of memories as sensory, short-term and long-term memory. This division is based on the range and the type of information that is piled up. Information that are fed through the sensory organs like eyes, nose, ear, tongue and skin are stored in sensory memory. For instance, the smell of rain, coffee or hearing a sound or music gets accumulated here. Short-term memory holds information for limited period, say, a few hours or days and are available for immediate access. This cannot hold larger amount of inputs as they are limited in capacity. Longterm memory stays in the mind for years together, sometimes for the whole life. These memories often comprises of objects and incidents that affect one’s self personally. Besides these, ‘Flashbulb Memories’ are yet another type of memory that do not fit under any time or range. They acquire such a name as they appear suddenly like flash floods. Unlike the other memories, these occur as vivid and highly detailed snapshots that originate at the times of shock or trauma. Recalling of personal events in which one is deeply injured or affected physically or mentally leads to flashbulb memories. These memories are the ones that kindle various feelings in everyone be it positive or negative. Apart from storage, memories undergo multiple levels of processing such as shallow processing or deep or semantic processing. In shallow processing, only the overall appearance of the incident gets projected whereas deep or semantic processing involves elaborative rehearsal of memories. In deep processing, the repercussions of the incident or something which may happen in future are synthesised. Further, some memories do not undergo any of the above mentioned processings, but, they fade and get into oblivion. This is called forgetting and this happens due to age, mental capacity or internal imbalances. Another phenomenon that supplements forgetting is interference. When some new information is fed, they interfere with the old memories because they may be interrelated with the old. Aligned with how these affect the existing memories, they can be proactive and retroactive. In retroactive memories they may inhibit the ability to memorise new information and in proactive memories they correlate with old information to store the upcoming ones. The cognitive psychologist Elizabeth Lofters in her research on the reliability of memories, discovered that even some false memories can be implanted to erase the existing or to International Journal of English, Literature and Social Sciences (IJELS) Vol-4, Issue-6, Nov – Dec 2019 https://dx.doi.org/10.22161/ijels.46.62 ISSN: 2456-7620 www.ijels.com Page | 2024 make believe something else. This is achieved with the help of violence and usage of weapons. These false memories that are rooted in the minds become a threat to the people compelling them to forget their true past and prodding them to get used to the newly injected ideas. All these kinds of memories play a vital role in the life of the diasporans. Diasporans are people who migrate to an alien land by interest in search of greener pastures or the people who are transported by force or compulsion like slaves or expatriates. While the first category of people try to get accustomed to the hostland, the latter the slaves and expatriates live in eternal sadness and fear. The word ‘diaspora’ is literally derived from the Greek word ‘diaspero’, which means ‘to scatter or to disperse’. This term was first used to represent the dispersion or the expulsion of the Jews from Judea after the conquest of Babylon. The term had also been used to represent the Africans who were sent to England and America as slaves. These kinds of people are called ‘diasporans’. Presently, in the twenty first century, the term is used to denote the people who leave their motherland and settle in other countries for some reason. The diasporic communities are also named after the places they have left like Asian Diaspora, Indian Diaspora, Canadian Diaspora, European Diaspora and others. Having settled in the host country, the diasporans face numerous hostile situations. Wearing the badge of two identities of the motherland and the fatherland, they live inbetween two cultures and sway with hyphenated identities as hybridised individuals. Resultantly, an attitude of not-athomeness surfaces in them at most moments. Not-athomeness is one of the characteristic features of the feeling of non-acceptance or alienation by which they, eventually become marginalised. These marginalised men strive hard to find their identities in their lives that are filled with rejection, prejudice and uncertainty. In such a bid, they seek different methods to adapt to either of the cultures by changing their life styles akin to that of the people of the hostland. Nevertheless, at times they fail in their attempts and feel like the translocated plants, that wither out in an hostile environment. Despite such an experience, the Diasporans hardly can return to their native country. Eventually, they try to evade from the pains in the new land, by clinging on to the memories of their motherland. In order to keep their memories alive and to experience at-homeness, they try to hold on to something of their motherland. They treasure some souvenirs of their ancestors in their minds or carry them in their suitcases. Recalling of such homeland memories gives them an enormous strength and help them sustain their lives in the adopted land. It is to be underscored that the diasporans tug with them their language, culture, custom and ethnicity wherever they move. They are unable to sever themselves from their past land immediately and fully. Moreover, facing hostility in the host land, it becomes necessary for them to firmly hold on to and retain their native culture and try to create a mid-world between the two, to bridge the gap at least to some extent. In the creation of a unique mid-world, wherein they are torn between both the lands, memories are used as building materials. In such an endeavour, some diasporans even emerge as ‘diasporic writers’ who pen down their memories with experiences as their scaffolding support. These diasporic writers focus on the off-centered people and try to unite their individual experiences collectively under one label as ‘Diaporans’, an identity or a label that they wear, irrespective of the nationalities they belong to. The writings also tend to be a collection of narrations of the heterogeneous people who face national, cultural, linguistic and ethnic challenges homogeneously in their day-to-day life at all levels. Their literary ventures give them a cathartic effect. This paper “A Sanctuary of Memory in Viet Thanh Nguyen’s “Black-Eyed Women” ” tries to analyse the different types of memories that steer the lives of the various generations of diasporans that build up a mid-world for them and also evaluates whether this created world is haunting or soothing to the diasporans as presented in the short story titled “The Black-Eyed Women” by Viet Thanh Nguyen. Being a diasporan of Vietnamese origin, Viet Thanh Nguyen lives with the hyphenated identity as VietnameseAmerican novelist. He heads the Aerol Arnold Chair of English and is presently working as a Professor of English, American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of California. Nguyen was born in Vietnam and was later moved to America due to war. Having experienced wars in Vietnam and as a displaced man his works are autobiographical loaded with his native land’s experiences. He reveals the toughened life of the diasporic people through his writings. He is an award winning novelist who has bagged a dozen of awards including Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Dayton Literary Prize for his debut novel Sympathiser in 2016. He published his second work The Refugees, a collection of short stories in the year 2017. Besides, he has written two non-fiction Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War in 2016 and Race and Resistance: Literature and Politics in Asian America in 2002.

Under such an information background, how to build a safe and efficient DNS system has become a key point. From the technical point of view of the security and reliability of domain name system, this paper puts forward the design idea of DNS system which is more in line with the current level of education informatization construction. Multi-DNS deployment, internal and external network separation, static or dynamic adjustment of analytical results, and application-level disaster recovery technology are important components of this design idea. The work draws experience from the application of traditional domain name technology in colleges and universities, and innovates construction ideas. Keywords—Education Informatization; DNS System; Network Security; Internet; Disaster Recovery I. BACKGROUND OF DNS SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION China's economic and social development is very fast, which can not be separated from the support of informationbased talents in the new era. Only more advanced educational concepts can provide sufficient talent support for China's socialist modernization. In order to achieve this goal, we must deepen educational reform and gradually establish a new educational system to meet the needs of economic and social development and modernization in the 21st century. Among them, education informationization, with the comprehensive application of information technology in the field of education as the core, provides favorable opportunities and conditions for promoting the reform and development of education. Information network is an important part of the construction of educational informatization, and also the material basis and prerequisite for the realization of educational informatization. At present, China Education and Research Network (CERNET) and China Satellite Broadband Distance Education Network, which have been built and launched in our country, are all important contents of information network infrastructure construction in education informatization. The construction of these infrastructures not only lays a foundation for the informationization of education in China, but also creates conditions for the implementation of informationization education. Since 2012, policies in the field of education informatization have been promulgated. The Ten-Year Development Plan of Education Informatization (2011-2020) in March 2012 provides guidance and general direction for the construction of education informatization in the next 10 years. In April 2012, Liu Yandong's teleconference on national education informationization determined the development orientation of ""Three links and two platforms"" for education informationization. With the implementation of educational informationization, colleges and universities rely more and more on information systems. Once it can not be used, there will be many problems in daily teaching, office and even life, so the high availability of information systems is also put forward higher and higher requirements. The guarantee of high availability of information system needs to be strengthened and strengthened from many aspects such as application system, network, security and so on. The design of availability guarantee is carried out in every link to support the normal operation of information system. II. THE CONSTRUCTION DEMAND OF DNS SYSTEM UNDER THE BACKGROUND OF EDUCATION INFORMATIZATION When using various information systems, from the user client to the application system in the chain access link, at the application system level, there are cluster, application load balancing and other technical means to improve the availability of the application system. Network and security devices can enhance their availability through link redundancy and device virtualization. However, the reliability of network services has not been paid attention to. This also makes it an obvious weak link. In order to be easy to use, the application system usually publishes by domain name. When users access the business system, they first need to parse the domain name and obtain its corresponding IP address for accessing through the network. The service of resolving domain name into IP address is domain name resolving service, commonly referred to as DNS. A. High Reliability of Domain Name System In the 1980s, DNS protocol came into being. Due to the limitation of computer performance and network bandwidth at that time, DNS was designed as a large global system with layered and distributed deployment. Each layer was responsible for maintaining the root domain, the top domain, the second domain and so on. However, since the birth of DNS protocol, domain name resolution function has always been the focus of construction. In terms of reliability, it only depends on the way of synchronization between primary and secondary, let alone the lack of its security function running on UDP protocol.

55efee8b69ee5ebd65242da8e5a02584d06adf61,Analysis on the Development Status of Internet of Things Industry in China,"China began as early as the 1990s to pay attention to the study the development of the Internet of Things industry. At present, China is in the middle of the world. The networking industry has formed and possessed materials, technologies and devices. A series of industrial chains, such as components and networks, have reached the Internet of Things to national standards for industrialization. But there are still some deep-seated problems that restrict the development of the Internet of Things to be solved in China. 1. Current Situation of Internet of Things in China In recent years, vigorous support of national policies and Industry has developed rapidly. With the continuous efforts of enterprises, China's Internet of Things industry continues to be good. With the good momentum of development, the Internet of Things in China has initially formed a complete system. The industrial system possesses certain technology, industry and application. Basically, the demographic dividend is gradually disappearing and the human cost is rapidly increasing. At present, the application of Internet of Things technology is to solve the problem of human resources. 2. An Effective Way to Improve Operational Efficiency According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China will consolidate in 2014.The sales revenue of the Internet of Things has reached more than 600 billion yuan. In recent years, China's Internet of Things industry has achieved a comprehensive growth rate. Over 30% fully reflects its strong development trend. Especially, in the field of intelligent manufacturing industry Internet of Things and Intelligent Transportation Vehicle Networking, Good Market Prospect has high growth whose speed keeps climbing. According to statistical estimation, M2M connection, in China, whose number has exceeded 73 million in 2014, a year-on-year increase 46%, accounting for 30% of global M2M connections, continue to maintain holding the World's First Market Position, which in China's M2M Regulation in the Future. The model will continue to expand. It is expected to reach 350 million by 2020, globally whose the proportion will reach 36%. The Internet of Things has become public, in China, which is in terms of application development including the safety, civil Aviation, transportation, environmental monitoring, smart grid, agriculture, industry and other industries ,which have been initially applied on a large scale, and some products have already been used. The level of perimeter intrusion prevention system is in the leading position in the world. Intelligent Home, Intelligent Medical Services, etc. for Individual Users. Overall, the development of the Internet of Things industry in China presents itself. 3. The following characteristics First, The Internet of Things Industry is still in its early stage in China. There is no concept introduction period and industrial chain formation stage. Mature Technical Standards and Perfect Technical System, Overall Production. The industry is in the embryonic stage. Previous RFD market expectations. Breakthroughs have been made in the areas of logistics and retailing, but involvement of the industrial chain is too long which the industrial organization is too complex and the transaction whose cost is too high. The problems, such as too high, limited scale of industry, 2018 7th International Conference on Advanced Materials and Computer Science (ICAMCS 2018) Published by CSP © 2018 the Authors 245 whose difficulty in reducing cost and so on, make it difficult for us to do so. The overall market growth is relatively slow. The development of the national Internet of Things industry has great potential. accenture. Research shows that China can further expand the Internet of Things whose influence was directed investment and other similar schemes which is provided support to improve national capacity to absorb Internet of Things technologies. The industry will also generate tremendous added value which taking manufacturing industry as an example which promoted by China's current policies and investment trends in the future. In 15 years, the Internet of Things can create $196 billion in manufacturing. The cumulative GDP of RMB. If we further expand the shadow of the Internet of Things. The economic value of China's manufacturing industry will jump to 7360. Second, the policy-oriented impact on the development of the Internet of Things in China which is multidimensional policy input to promote the present stage. The strongest driving force for the development of China's Internet of Things industry. If it is to say country, the development of IOT industry belongs to the ""market-driven type"", domestic which is closer to the ""policy-driven"". Wenjia since August 2009.Internet of Things has been formalized since Premier Bao proposed ""Perception of China"". As one of the five emerging strategic industries in the country, it is written into ""politics"". Government Work Report "", Internet of Things in China by the whole society extreme great attention. After 2015, the Chinese government launched ""China"" manufacturing 2025 strategy to improve the competitiveness of manufacturing industry. ""In Made-in-China 2025 aims to transform China into a manufacturing power, China Improves China's Position in Global Manufacturing Value Chain. By integrating production processes with the Internet, manufacturing industry to become more environmentally friendly, intelligent and quality. In addition, the Chinese Government which is also pushing the ""Internet +"" strategy to integrate the mobile Internet. With the wide application of technology and intelligent technology, the Internet of Things will become the national promotion of information work. Policy support is expected to continue to increase. Thirdly, under the promotion of government policy, the Internet of Things in China is launched. Exhibitions follow from public management and service markets. To enterprises and industries application of Market and the way to Gradual Development of Individual Family Market is main goal. The concept of Internet of Things was put forward which is urgent to face it. Public management and service areas of demand are indicated by government applications. It will be necessary for Fan project to start the market of animal networking. Then, with the application of public management and service market, it will be solved. Continuous maturity of scheme, it enterprise agglomeration and technology integration. And gradually form a relatively complete industrial chain of the Internet of Things. Thus, it will be able to drive the application market of large enterprises in various industries. Fourth, the industrial system of the Internet of Things is relatively perfect, and the Internet of Thing with sensor industry agglomeration development effect highlights, in many industries. The development platform has been initially formed. Our country has formed covers perception. Manufacturing, Network Manufacturing, Software and Information Processing, Network and Response complete Internet of Things industry with services and other categories. The scale of industry continues to expand has formed around the Bohai Sea, Changsan. The spatial layout of the exhibition shows that the high-end elements are gathered and developed. Internet of Things Platform for Large Enterprises in Enterprise Development has basically taken shape. Small enterprises have joined the ecosphere of large enterprises in the situation of Lida Platform appears. With the application's landing and availability, the gradual accumulation of data mining, the value of the Internet of Things industry begins to appear. Internet of Things and the New is under the Leadership of Information Technology Enterprises in promoting the Cooperative Development of Technology, Innovating Enterprises and Innovating Products. Fifthly, the development of Internet of Things industry in China is still at the present stage which focus on technological breakthroughs, autonomous MEMS sensor products. industrialization are still the main development of Internet of Things industry. The rapid rise of emerging industries which is as such as the Internet of Things makes biography possible. Sensors are becoming more and more important in the world.

9c25c6c42fa6b91b604e12baca5218b3efed4ecf,Seeking new perspectives: Engineers experiencing design through creative arts,"The engineering curriculum of necessity focuses heavily on technical subjects—mathematics, chemistry, physics, and the large body of discipline-specific material. The arts are frequently present only in vestigial form and are regarded as tangential at best to the real engineering curriculum. However, an experience of the creative arts beyond the superficial might reveal that the artist and the engineer are not as different as is usually supposed. The University of Texas at Tyler has conducted an experimental project in which engineering students were encouraged to experience the design process afresh from the perspective of the creative arts. Juniors in electrical engineering worked under the mentorship of arts faculty in a chosen medium (studio art, writing, or music) to produce legitimate works of art that were displayed, performed, or read publicly, and documented how their experiences of design in the arts have informed and shaped their perspectives as engineers. The structure, expectations, and results of this course are described in this paper. A pedagogical crisis presents an opportunity The BSEE and BSME curricula of the University of Texas at Tyler include a required course entitled “Design Methodology in Engineering.” The course’s catalog description states that it is “an overview of design activity in engineering” and includes “the product design process; project planning; quality function deployment; design specifications; concept generation and selection; system and subsystem design.” This course would appear to have prima facie relevance and value to engineering students; however, its reception among EE students has been lukewarm at best. Thirty-one graduating EE seniors between 2011 and 2013 (the latest years for which data have been compiled) assessed the usefulness of Design Methodology as 2.65 on a scale of 1 – 5 with 1 representing “Little Usefulness,” 3 representing “Useful,” and 5 representing “Essential.” (Eight students chose the extremes of this scale, with six choosing “Little Usefulness” compared to two choosing “Essential”). Design Methodology had traditionally been taught by Mechanical Engineering faculty to mixed classes of EE and ME students. However, circumstances in the fall of 2015 disrupted this longstanding comity. The large number of ME juniors enrolling in the course outstripped the available faculty resources (both the EE and ME Departments had faculty vacancies) and provoked a decision in fall, 2015, to limit enrollment in Design Methodology in the spring of 2016 to ME students only. However, rather than simply finding someone to teach Design Methodology for its students, the EE Department challenged its faculty to find creative solutions to the crisis. Two proposals were eventually put forward. One proposal was to create an additional technical elective involving Matlab, Simulink, and LabVIEW. The other was an exploration of the design process through participation by engineers in the creative arts. The genesis of this particular proposal is described in the following paragraphs. Insights from Gustave Flaubert One of the authors of this paper has long harbored Francophile tendencies and approximately a year ago undertook as a personal goal to read Gustave Flaubert’s masterpiece Madame Bovary in the original French. This particular edition of the text 1 included an appendix that described the genesis of the novel, including Flaubert’s development of detailed scenarios for the events of his novel in which Flaubert described the setting, characters involved, and outcomes of these events. The level of detail and planning seems remarkable to an engineer; Flaubert even drew a simple map of the fictional village of Yonville-l’Abbaye in which much of the story takes place. Many pages include cross-outs and marginal notes related to the plot. Faculty in the arts, however, are used to seeing such careful mapping of setting, plot, and characters in imaginative texts, especially in longer works such as novels. Similar plans were made by Charles Dickens and Jane Austen for their novels, and by William Wordsworth and John Keats for their poems. Figure 1 shows images excerpted from Flaubert’s original manuscript (which is now available on-line). 2 Fig. 1. Excerpts of Gustave Flaubert’s manuscript of Madame Bovary. Left: opening page. Marginal notes about characters and settings appear on the left-hand side of the page. Center: chapter 1, folio 24 of Flaubert’s manuscript, showing extensive editing. 4 Right: Flaubert’s hand-drawn map of Yonville-l’Abbaye. Flaubert’s meticulous detail, planning, and documentation evident in the artifacts he created are reminiscent of the detail, planning, and documentation in engineering design. Flaubert, like other imaginative writers, evidently employed a structured process by which he brought his work to fruition. This encounter with the artifacts of Flaubert’s creative process posed the following question: what sorts of structured design processes do other artists use—and could engineers learn from them? Engineering—a straitjacket curriculum? The process of answering this question began with a survey of literature; and, somewhat surprisingly, there does exist a body of literature bearing on the relationship of engineering and the creative arts. But some of that literature concluded that the engineering curriculum has little room for engagement with the arts. Lichtentstein et al 6 have performed an extensive analysis of data from the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) and have drawn conclusions regarding the engineering curriculum. They conclude that the tightly-packed engineering curriculum leaves little room for studies for personal development; as a consequence, engineering students report the least engagement among all majors in foreign languages, study abroad, and independent study. The perceived benefits of the liberal arts component of the engineering degree are consequently low. They speculate that a narrow curriculum may discourage students from continuing in engineering or enrolling in engineering in the first place: “Might students who leave engineering (or who never enroll who might otherwise have considered the degree) enter STM [Science, Technology, and Mathematics] and Business believing that they can still acquire practical skills that make engineering so appealing, while giving themselves curricular breathing room for enriching educational activities that are difficult or impossible to pursue when enrolled in engineering?” The rigid curriculum would appear to be an impediment to the education of the socially-aware, humanistically-competent graduates envisioned in The Engineer of 2020 (among whose traits is “the creativity of Pablo Picasso”). 7 These observations prompt the question, could engineers draw benefits from a curriculum in which they have greater exposure to the arts? Loosening the straitjacket—the benefits of arts training for engineers and scientists The engineering curriculum is indeed bursting at the seams with technical subjects; however, a number of authors make the case that engineers and scientists would reap much benefit from including the creative arts in their education. Root-Bernstein and Root-Bernstein 8 make extensive observations about the benefits of arts education to scientists and engineers. They state that arts and crafts develop skills of observation, visual thinking, manipulation, and the ability to discern patterns. Drawing and painting, they observe, also contribute to fine-motor skills. Albert Einstein, Luis Alvarez, Richard Feynman, and Hans von Euler-Chelpin (winner of the 1929 Nobel Prize for Chemistry) are cited as scientists whose arts avocations enabled their success in science. The RootBernsteins further observe that scientists who have achieved at the highest levels in their fields are significantly more likely than their peers to practice an avocation in the arts. In their view, arts education is not a dispensable luxury. Kellam et al, 9 drawing upon their experience with an interdisciplinary (engineering/art) design studio program, state that “deliberately engaging students in creative thinking processes is thus critical to their development as innovative thinkers who are able to work across multiple knowledge domains.” Shuster 10 argues that exposure of engineering students to the liberal and the fine arts is important not just because it will make them better members of society, but because it will make them better engineers. Shuster proposes further that creation in art and creation in engineering have much in common, and that the study of the liberal arts and the fine arts requires creative participation on the part of the student in ways that the engineering curriculum does not. The author contends that “the activity of research in engineering has far more in common with artistic creation or even with the appreciation of a work of art than anything which we usually teach in our engineering classes.” Root-Bernstein 11 emphasizes the roles of observation, empathy, and envisioning in scientific discovery and states that all are strengthened by artistic training. He cites the work of anthropologist and painter Desmond Morris (author of The Naked Ape) to support his contention that “scientific insight and inspiration stem from empathy, feelings, dreams, visions or, more simply, what Max Planck (himself a concert-caliber pianist) has called the ‘artistically creative imagination.’ "" Laplante and Flaxman 12 invoke the concept of aesthetics to explain the preference for “elegant” proofs in mathematics and science. They state that information presentation must include considerations of aesthetics and that developments in video and computer technologies are creating niches where computer, video, and audio technologies are converging with art forms like music, painting, sculpture, and theater. This literature points to the following: (1) greater exposure of engineers to creative arts wo",,2016.0,5,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/26154.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/p.26154?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/p.26154, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9f033888f2ed23005e824dfb91f6c56601472ba5,Forming Master's Degree Students' ICT Competencies as Future Researchers and Educators: A Kazakhstan Case Study.,"This article analyses the information and communications technology competencies (ICTC) of Master’s degree students in Kazakhstan. It defines the ICTC. Research results suggest that the majority of Master’s degree students have a low level of ICTC. Of prime importance is the fact that the level of research and educational aspects of the ICTC of Master’s degree students in the study is lower than the subject matter aspect. The research shows that teachers and advisers are faced with certain difficulties in organising Master’s students’ scientific research and educational internship. This leads to the need to create additional tools to provide a means of controlling the ICTC-shaping process of Master’s students. The research found that one the most effective tools promoting optimization while working with Master’s students in scientific research, educational and research internship is blended learning technology integrated into the university’s virtual and educational environment. OPEN ACCESS 11176 ABYKENOVA ET AL. Today Master’s program is the most important stage in training scientific manpower. According to the European Higher Education Area Qualification for Master’s programs (the descriptor for the second cycle in the Framework for Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area corresponds to the learning outcomes for EQF level 7), a future Master has highly specialized knowledge in his/her field of study, has critical thinking skills in understanding issues in his/her study area, and has specialized skills in problem-solving in scientific research field. Master’s programs in Kazakhstan are developing in accordance with the procedures of the Bologna process; however we have our own individualities. In particular, there are two types of Master’s programs in Kazakhstan: a) research and educational Master’s program which trains researchers and teachers (a 2 years’ course), and b) field-specific Master’s program training specialists in one particular area (a 1 or 1.5 year’s course). The modernisation of the Kazakhstan system of education identified the necessity of training and linking academics to the system of school education. Thus, according to the State program of education development (2010) in Kazakhstan, the number of teachers having a Master’s Degree at professionoriented schools must reach 20% by 2020. It imposes certain requirements on the quality of teacher training of future Masters. ICTC has an important place in a Master’s degree students’ professional competence as a future researcher and educator. Previous research (Rogers and Twidle, 2013; McGarr and O'Brien, 2007; Lavonen et al., 2006; Lapchik, 2007; Gutiérrez and Serrano Sánchez, 2016; Keijo, 2014) address various aspects of shaping an educator’s ICTC. The scientific aspect of a Master’s student’s competency is examined in many studies (Kehm and Teichler, 2006; Lub et al., 2003; Pombo and Costa, 2009; Bailey and Sorensen, 2013; Harrison and Edwards, 2012; O'Reilly, 1996; Brooks et al., 012; Bourke and Holbrook, 2013). Rowland suggests that a close interrelation of ‘teaching’ and ‘scientific research’ can improve the quality of teaching at university (1996). Twalib points out that ICTC is necessary for proper research activity (2012). Verhoeven connects the level of interest in conducting scientific research with the knowing and using a students’ ICT level (2016). However, some researchers (Roberts and Wilson, 2002) suggest that the role of computer software is limited in a qualitative analysis of scientific data. It is important to note that the number of integrative research studies describing ICTC of a Master’s Degree student as a future researcher and educator is quite small. For the most part, the research literature deals with only one aspect of ICTC. Thus, Gerova examines various approaches of lifelong learning in forming information competency of Bachelor and Master’s Degree Students (2014). Research literature emphasizes the necessity of using ICT in research and educational activity, or describing educators’ and researchers’ ICTC, although the structure of the ICTC of a Master’s Degree Student as a researcher and educator has not been fully examined yet. In the educational Master’s program of Kazakhstan a lot of time is allocated to research, educational internships and thesis supervision. Research results to date (Castle et al., 2013; Keys, 2015; Brown, 2002) demonstrate the importance of internships for developing students’ practical skills. Agreeing that organising a Master’s Degree Student’s internship and scientific research work allows formation of competencies in INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL & SCIENCE EDUCATION 11177 pedagogy and didactics, as well as in the field of research, can we assume that organising this educational work effectively will also enable the formation of Master’s Degree Student’s ICTC? This research is aimed at studying the anticipated problems in forming a Master’s students’ ICTC. In particular, the following questions and issues are addressed: 1) What is the ICTC structure of a Kazakhstan Master’s Degree? 2) What is the ICTC status of Master’s students? 3) What difficulties occur in forming a Master’s Student’s ICTC? 4) What are the solutions? 2. Theory 2.1. On Master’s Student’s Professional Activity in Kazakhstan Master’s programs are formally differentiated into the academic Master’s program (with the emphasis on scientific research work) and the field-specific Master’s program enabling a deliberate change of one’s major field or a continuation of one’s basic education (Kehm et al., 2006; Lub et al., 2003). In Kazakhstan, a Master, having completed a scientific and educational Master’s program, and having defended a thesis, can teach at any educational institution. The field-oriented Master’s program only gives specialized in-depth knowledge, and such a Master cannot teach. Masters who follow the scientific and educational route are the future academic staffs who have the requisite all-round training. Thus, a Master of Engineering receives humanities/sociological knowledge in the sphere of didactics and education. According to the literature (Pombo and Costa, 2009; Bailey and Sorensen, 2013; Harrison and Edwards, 2012; O'Reilly, 1996; Brooks et al., 2012, Bourke and Holbrook, 2013; Suleimenov and Kulevskaya, 2007) there are three main types of a Master’s student’s activity as a researcher and educator, regardless of the field: a) activity in the subject area, b) scientific research activity, and c) research and educational activity. The correlation of these types of activity is comprehensive: educational activity is based on the fundamentals of the subject area and scientific research activity as illustrated with the Euler diagram below (Figure 1). Figure 1. The structure of a Master’s Degree Student’s professional activity. 11178 ABYKENOVA ET AL. Needless to say, a Master’s student must have fundamental knowledge in his/her subject area. Apart from the basic knowledge received at the Bachelor level, a Master’s student studies additional in-depth knowledge connected with his/her scientific research activity. As scientific research activity is applicable to any area of knowledge, it is the most complex one and includes the fundamentals and activities directly related to the subject area. Any research and educational activity is based on the knowledge from the subject area, education science and teaching methodology, as well as on the competencies in the area of research and educational activity, as a teacher in the classroom also has to demonstrate the epistemic (research) logic of the subject matter. 2.2. The structure of a Master’s Degree Student’s ICTC ICTC, as many authors suggest (Rogers and Twidle, 2013; McGarr and O'Brien, 2007, Lavonen et al.; 2006, Lapchik, 2007), is one of the key professional competencies of a teacher. The authors’ works conclude that the ICT competencies penetrate all the components of a Master’s Degree Student’s professional competencies. It is explained by the fact that ICTs are applied to any type of a Master’s Degree Student’s activity as a researcher and educator. Studying the international practices of training Master’s students has identified various approaches towards defining the structure and contents of a Master’s degree student’s ICTC as a researcher and educator. Thus, Rogers and Twidle examine a teacher in ICTC as an architect and a manger who studies information technologies for searching new ways of organising and managing education (2013). Larsen et al. state that it is necessary to develop ICTC in four directions: assistance to ICT; control; coaching; and co-operation (Larsen et al., 2008). Other researchers (Lavonen et al., 2006) have included a Master’s degree student’s virtual learning skills into ICTC. Lapchik has identified the invariant structure of a competency which includes key, basic, and special competency (2007). In accordance with this, we define ICTC of a Master’s student as a researcher and educator in Table 1 (Appendix A). The familiarity with such components of the ICTC in research and educational activity, and ICTC in scientific research activity, by default suggests the Master’s student’s computer competence. Based on analysis of academic literature, and taking teaching activity at higher and other education levels into account, and given the development of modern teaching techniques, we were able to define a Master’s student’s ICTC broadly as a researcher and educator. This profile consists of three components: ICT in the subject area, ICT in research and educational activity area, and ICT in scientific research activity area. The development of the Kazakhstan educational system, and the improvements in computer processing in scientific and technical information, lead to the premise that the contents of ICT competencies can be changed and adjusted as required. 2.3 The role of a Master’s Degree Student’s internship and IC",,2016.0,5,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.15293/2226-3365.1701.03', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15293/2226-3365.1701.03?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15293/2226-3365.1701.03, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1db9f5340f9657fd9c26322ff3dbebd87eaa2cf9,A Proposed Conceptual Framework: Unlocking a Potential Approach to Evaluating In-Service Teacher Training Programme,"The conceptual paper generally elucidates a potential approach to evaluating in-service teacher training programmes in Malaysia. Undeniably, Malaysia has continuously invested in the field of teacher professional development, particularly aimed at enhancing the standards of English but of little fruition. Therefore, with the inception of the Professional Up-skilling of English Language Teachers (Programme), this galvanizes the undertaking study to bring to the forefront the efficacy of the programme. To this end, the Kirkpatrick’s evaluation model is utilised but restricted to the first two levels of the model only so that it is aligned with the primary purpose of the Pro-ELT Programme. The Kirkpatrick’s evaluation model is then underpinned by tenets drawn from 3 flagship theories/hypothesisSociocultural Theory by Vygotsky, Adult Learning Theory by Knowles and Affective Filter Hypothesis by Krashen, thus conceptualizing the framework of the study. Guided by the conceptual framework, this directly engenders a refined understanding of ideal evaluation practice and at the same time sheds light on possible factors affecting the success of the designed programme. Introduction Till to date, English has played a very significant role in the development of a nation and therefore it is not surprising that efforts to improve the quality of English have ceaselessly been pursued and intensified including those of English-speaking countries, i.e, the United Kingdom and the United States of America (Lee, 2011). However, despite the concerted attempts to strengthen the command of English, the standard of English is declining in many parts of the world which in return would mar the country’s economic outlook in the global milieu. Amongst the primary reasons for the ill-state of English proficiency is inextricably linked with ill-proficient teachers of English and the fact that the shortage of professionally trained English teachers is acutely critical might have adversely affected the quality of English taught at school, thus perpetuating the vicious cycle of English education afflicting both the teachers and students (Sukri, 2018). International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 8 , No. 10, Oct. 2018, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2018 HRMARS 50 In the Malaysian context, the deterioration in English needs no introduction and as reported by the English Language Standards and Quality Council (2015), the quality of English in the country is utterly disappointing. Evidently, scores of Malaysian university graduates have been unemployed due to their incompetence in the English language (Yunus & Sukri, 2017). If such matter fails to be addressed promptly, it would certainly bring dire consequences for the country’s futuristic prospects where the mastery of English is indispensable especially in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Nevertheless, more worryingly, the sheer number of Malaysian English teachers at both primary and secondary levels have been identified as ill-proficient users of English based on their appalling performance in the Cambridge Placement Test, aimed at measuring the level of English proficiency on the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) scale. Specifically, two-thirds of the 70, 000 English teachers across the country are at the CEFR level of B2 and below, hence failing to meet the required proficiency level set at C1 and above (Jalleh, 2012). Even though the level of English proficiency that Malaysian teachers possess is not as critical as their counterparts in Thailand (Franz & Teo, 2017) and Vietnam (Luong, 2016), it inevitably still poses a serious threat to the English education reform that the Government of Malaysia has been committed to making it a success as articulated in the Malaysia Education Blueprint. Aware of the magnitude of the matter, the Ministry of Education, Malaysia in collaboration with the British council initiated a blended in-service teacher training programme or more popularly known as Pro-ELT (Professional Up-skilling of English Language Teachers) in 2012 (Eshtehardi, 2014) and as of now, it has been running for more than 6 years. As the name of the programme suggests, it comprises 240 hours of in-class training and another 240 hours of online learning sessions under the facilitation and guidance of the British council trainers who are mostly native speakers of English and the whole programme is expected to run for one whole year. Teachers enrolled in Pro-ELT are expected to obtain C1 and above by the end of the programme. Even though the programme has been in existence for quite a number of years, very little research has been conducted to highlight the efficacy of the Pro-ELT Programme in improving English teachers’ proficiency level. Thus far, research conducted has offered a micro view of the programme and mostly centred on mere perceptions (Eshtehardi, 2014; Kaur, 2015; Nor et al., 2018; Sukri & Yunus, 2018a; Sukri & Yunus, 2018b) without highlighting measurable outcomes or tangible results with the exception of the study by Sukri and Yunus (2018c). In fact, most evaluative studies have long been focused on distal measures (perceptions) without much emphasis on proximal measures (Seidel & Shavelson, 2007). Moreover, even though the programme participants’ views are gathered, the fact that the studies are mostly initiated by the programme trainers (English Language Teaching Centre, 2015) might have increased the researcher’s effects or Hawthorne effects, hence leading to mixed results (Nor et al., 2018). Taking cognizance of these arising matters, this gives an impetus for the present study to not just systematically evaluate the Pro-ELT Programme by addressing both distal and proximal measures but also acknowledge the contextual factors rarely highlighted in previous studies such as the environment they were situated in during the programme, their emotions and their identity as adult learners which might influence the attainment of the desired goal of the programme. Indeed, the endeavour to highlight these underlying factors is very much in tandem with the aspiration of the second wave (2016-2020) articulated in the Malaysia Education Blueprint which is to evaluate the International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 8 , No. 10, Oct. 2018, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2018 HRMARS 51 effectiveness of the initiatives being implemented (English Language Standards & Quality Council, 2015). A Review of Literature Kirkpatrick’s Evaluation Model It is with a clear understanding that no matter how carefully a new programme is planned, there would always be hiccups and setbacks (English Language Standards and Quality Council, 2015). Therefore, this requires a proper evaluation. Basically, the purpose of evaluation is to prescribe changes and make a programme better (Salehi, Davari & Yunus, 2015) and without it, there is no other viable way to assure investments on training are worth every single penny (Mohamed & Alias, 2014; Baker et al., 2017). Such practice runs parallel to the notion of efficiency as outlined in the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2013-2025 where it is geared towards enhancing the quality of education within the allocated budgets. In fact, evaluation process is an integral part of any professional development programme targeting at improving both teacher teaching and student learning so that the time and resources spent can be justified (Phillips & Stone, 2002; Wedell, 2017). Moreover, it is important to ensure there is a continuous evaluation to ensure the desired goals of the implemented programme or policy can be achieved as envisaged (Kepol, 2017). Equally important, evaluation should be focused on the end-users, in the context of the present study, English teachers attending Pro-ELT so as to depict the reality of training programme better (Alshuwairekh, 2016) and at the same time could contribute to the scarcity of studies on how practising teachers improve their target language proficiency upon pre-service training (Chambless, 2012). The Kirkpatrick’s evaluation of training model or also known as the Kirkpatrick training evaluation framework was created in the 1950s by Donald Kirkpatrick, the former president of the American Society for Training and Development and professor at the University of Wisconsin. It is to be noted that this model has long been a guiding principle in evaluating corporate businesses and institutions (Philip & Stone, 2002) and its ever-growing popularity and powerful influence needs no introduction as it has always been referred to for evaluating training programmes (Aryadoust, 2016). Nevertheless, it has seldom been used in the educational contexts despite its immense potential benefits (Aryadoust, 2016; Keogh, 2015; Praslova, 2010). The Kirkpatrick model, generally, consists of four stages represented by level one: reactions, level two: learning, level three: behaviour, level four: result as shown below. Figure 2.1 Kirkpatrick Four-Level Training Evaluation Model Source: Kirkpatrick Partners International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 8 , No. 10, Oct. 2018, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2018 HRMARS 52 In detail, reaction level measures the participants’ satisfaction and perceptions and it is typically conducted through questionnaires distributed at the end of the programme (Kirkpatrick, 1998). This level is concerned with the participants’ reactions to content relevance, trainers’ knowledge and delivery or online learning, in the case of blended language programme, as well as the overall satisfaction with the pogramme (Phillips Associates, 2015). To put it simply, reaction level describes how the participants feel and their personal reactions to the training or learning experience (Kirkpatrick, 1959). Learning level, on the other hand, is focused on the acquisition of knowledge or skills which can be measured through pre-and–post tests (Kirkpatrick, 1996).

17e3cae3131a3ec047b9f8774b1944b215e62f47,The Influence Analysis of Green Economy on the Development of Majors under Economics and Management in Vocational Colleges in China,"As the mainstream model of world economy development, green economy has always advocated green and management concepts throughout the process of economy development in our country. In the meantime, in order to speed up the reality of green development that realizes the long-term plan for promoting social employment and solving livelihood problems, the Central Government actively advocates developing modern vocational education. A series of measures that vigorously develop vocational education, earnestly turn economic growth onto scientific and technological progress, improve educational level of workers, and analyze influences of green economy will provide references for the development of majors under Economics and Management in vocational colleges in our country. The Status Quo of Green Economy Development in China “Green Economy” was first proposed by British economist Pierce in Blue Book of Green Economy published in 1989, which is one of the most dynamic and promising economy forms in the 21st century. Green economy is a form that is market-oriented, based on traditional industrial economy and developed for the purpose of economic and environmental harmony. Also, it is a state of development that industrial economy has produced and demonstrated in the sake of human environmental protection and health. In short, it is a low-carbon, an environmentally friendly and a renewable economy. The focus of China’s green economy development is to achieve green growth by greening industrial structure and developing green booming industries. “Proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on formulating the 13 th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development” adopted by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18 th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China combined “Greenness” with “Innovation, Coordination, Opening up and Sharing” as “Development Concepts”. As one of the major development concepts and goals, green economy runs through all aspects of economic and social development in the “13 th Five-Year Plan”. What’s more, during important transition period for China’s economy development momentum, green economy is expected to become a new impetus to promote sustained economic growth and upgrade. Vocational and technical education center of Ministry of education had successfully applied for the project of APEC, which is use environmental way and skill to develop the vocational education in 2014. This is the first time that China has successfully applied for a vocational education project from APEC since 21 century. The purpose of this project is to combine the idea of green, environment friendly and sustainable development with the vocational system together, meanwhile it also could train environmental skilled talents and most importantly it could stimulate the economy and society development of the area on APEC. Some idea had been presented such as the basic connotation of green skills, the catalog of the development of some typical areas in Asian, how to build the network of green skill on Asian areas. The project also had set up a comprehensive reach group and a special reach group; they included 11 specialties which are Agriculture, energy, meteorological environmental protection, construction, manufacturing, logistics, petrochemical, computer, e-commerce, medicine and tourism. Some topics have been mentioned clearly in the National medium and long-term plan for education reform and development outlines(2010-2020), such as accelerate the development of 8th International Conference on Social Science and Education Research (SSER 2018) Copyright © 2018, the Authors.

a7f0b278a3d38c4cace054bf424040f1bfbb4c88,A Model of Measuring and Predicting the Water Condition,"In this article, we mainly discuss the problem of water shortage and exhaustion and how to relieve it. A model is developed to measure and predict the water condition of a region and then an intervention plan is designed for the water scarcity region. Firstly, to build the model to measure the water supply ability of a region, “water supply capacity” is defined as the ratio of the total amount of water required to the amount of available water. We use Grey Predict Model, People Logistic Model, Auto Regressive Model and Cubic Spline Interpolation fitting method to predict the “water supply capacity”. Then we take Tianjin for example, the model result shows that the water supply ability of it is very poor, which agrees well with the reality. Secondly, we select the North China as study object where water overloaded in the given UN water scarcity map. After reading a large amount of relevant references, we give an opinion on why and how water is scarce in this region. Moreover, we use the above model to predict the water condition of North China in 15 years. We get that the amount of water required is stable while the amount of available water to be reduced. Thus water scarcity will more severe at the future. Thirdly, to fix the problem of water shortage, we design an intervention water saving plan. From the solving of the above model, we draw a conclusion that live water consumption and agricultural water consumption account for a large proportion. We apply Ramsey Pricing model to make optimal water price. And we change the way of irrigation from flood irrigation to sprinkling irrigation. Furthermore, according to the prediction, the water consumption is about 34.18123 billion cubic meters in 2137. But the total water resources predicted is 34.16923 billion cubic meters. Introduction As is known to all, water is the source of life. Thus the discussion on water has been continuously. We know that despite the fact that seventy percent of the earth‟s surface is covered with water, only a little part of it is fresh. The deep groundwater and ice solid water are difficult to explore with the limitation of technology. However, with the expansion of the population and development of the economy, the demand of clean water has increased rapidly (twice the rate of population). This type of scarcity is called Physical scarcity (the water in some regions cannot meet the need) .Physical scarcity and economic scarcity are two primary causes. In the developing country, there are about 1 billion people have no access to clean water and1.7 billion people have no good sanitation facilities. About 25 million people die from drinking unclear water each year. United Nations estimates that nearly half of the world‟s population will live in areas lacking water in 2025[1].The lack of sanitation facilities is one of economic scarcity, for example. Meanwhile, water pollution also contributes to the shortage.[2] Will the clean water be used up someday? How to improve the severe situation by taking measures? To answer these questions, we manage to finish the following work:  Develop a model to measure the water supply capacity of one region.  Elaborate the present situation of water shortage and explains the reason of the shortage in a water overloaded area from the Physical and Economical scarcity aspects.  Use the above model to predict the water situation of the picked region in 15 years and 7th International Conference on Education, Management, Computer and Medicine (EMCM 2016) Copyright © 2017, the Authors.

7caedf5d6820f0db3bc1d6df2e95b511d39a8ec2,Introduction of the Plenary Speaker,"National Institute of Technology Colleges (Kosen) is a unique Japanese higher educational institute for engineering education founded in 1961. There are 51 NIT colleges across Japan and recently several Kosen colleges were established in Asian countries including Thailand. The colleges accept students from junior high school at age of 16 and give a five years higher engineering education. One department consists of 40 students and one college usually operates 4-5 departments. Therefore only one percent of the same age population have a chance to get early engineering education in a small-size class of Kosen college. These colleges share main core curriculum as well as their original education contents. Inter-college contests such as famous Robot contest, Programming contest, Design competition and so on are highlights of Kosen education. NIT(Kosen) Toyota College locates in the city of Toyota which is a home of Toyota Motor Corporation. With five engineering departments such as Mechanical, Electrical and Electronic, Information and Computer, Civil, and Architecture, Toyota College provides unique education in collaboration with local corporations such as long term internship. In this lecture, the characteristic early engineering education system of NIT(Kosen) college is summarized and several practical examples among education programs in Toyota College are introduced. ABSTRACT Mechanical structures of key projects in high-speed rail, aerospace, and automobile industries put forward higher requirements for reliability and long life. The problem of very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) has recently attracted significant attention and special research from scientists and engineers. This lecture summarized our research progress on the development of ultrasonic-accelerated vibrational fatigue testing methods in the loading modes of tension-tension, bending and torsion, which have been successfully coupled with complex environments such as corrosion, vacuum, high pressure and high temperature. Furthermore, the VHCF properties including S-N curves, crack initiation and propagation mechanism at multi-scales and life prediction models based on different physical mechanisms were presented for high strength metallic materials. The research results have been successfully applied to the life assessment of major equipment such as aero engines, gas turbines, bridges, etc. Thermotolerant fermenting microbes bear the potential to efficiently produce useful materials under stress conditions, including heat stress. We have thus been exploring such microbes in tropical countries that are considered to adapt to high temperature environments, for over 20 years. The number of publications relating to thermotolerant microbes in the world is increasing to more than 200 articles per year, and their potential for industrial applications is further enhanced by combination with abiotec advanced technologies. In my talk, I will introduce high-temperature fermentation with thermotolerant microbes, bioethanol production, the improvement of their stress tolerance and several types of experiments for industrial applications. NRCT, MOST in and Core involved in for ABSTRACT Thailand is attempting to drive the country under the Bio – Circular – Green (BCG) economy model which offers a sustainable growth based on its immense wealth of natural and bio-resources and less dependence on fossil-based resources. Transforming the existing fossil-based economy to the BCG economy requires great effort, interaction and collaboration between different players on various levels. Although it provides a new opportunity for industry, research, policy and financing stakeholders to work together to design new values for the country, the successful implementation of this concept nowadays is still rare as it requires many key elements for achievement such as advanced and multidisciplinary technologies, talented human resource, and strong public and private partnership. BCGeTEC was recently established aiming at supporting this transformation to BCG economy. Based on our strong academic and research background on chemical engineering, BCGeTEC focuses on collaborative research and innovation between different disciplines and institutions nationally and internationally. It also aims at extending from fundamental research in laboratory to industrial scale to achieve high impact to the economy. In addition, BCGeTEC supports the human resource development through training and education. Our Objectives and Key Results (OKR) as well as activities will be introduced. Dr. Armando T. Quitain is currently a Professor at the Center for International Education, Kumamoto University (Kumamoto, Japan). His research interests are centered around development of green technologies based on microwave carbocatalysis and supercritical fluids as applied to biomass conversion. He is currently the Lead Principal Investigator of the e-ASIA Joint Research Project on Alternative Energy (Bioenergy): “Development of Algal Bioenergy Systems for Green and Sustainable ASEAN Region”, which aims to convert algal biomass into biofuels and biochemicals. He is also collaborating with Kyoto University for Japan-ASEAN Science and Technology Innovation Platform (JASTIP) program to strengthen research collaboration among Japan and ASEAN universities. As a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Scientist for Joint International Research, he is also collaborating with top researchers from Germany and Spain on CO 2 utilization and conversion technologies. All these research activities are in accord with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, which forms the “blueprint for a better and more sustainable future for all.” Student mobility is also in his portfolio, developing exchange programs (outbound and inbound) to cultivate “global mindset” to future global STI leaders that will promote sustainability in the region and beyond. He been exploring many challenges that Japan could offer over 24 date. ABSTRACT The rapid progress of civilization has inevitably resulted in pervasive environmental pollutions. Off late, various anthropogenic pollutants have been directly or indirectly discharged into the soil, water and air mediums with the quantities depending on the extent of socioeconomic developments. To reciprocate in cushioning the untoward impacts on the environment, also myriad treatment approaches have been employed to remove, if not to degrade the pollutants until reaching the innocuous level. Unconsciously, some of the adopted physicochemical approaches may generate secondary pollutants or intermediates which are more debilitating to the environment. Viewing from the sustainability perspective, the imprudent options may as well entail intensive energy requirements which are not cost-effective in the long run. Ideally, the Green Chemistry mode of remediations via bioconversion has been extensively explored in proffering insights and novel solutions that will help addressing the pressing concerns associated to the environmental pollutions. However, the common trade-off incurred by the bioconversion such as long bioremediation time need has limited its feasibilities for real applications; albeit having a cost advantage. Therefore, it is of great interest to delve into spurring the metabolisms of targeted macroorganisms/microorganisms employed to execute the bioconversion processes. The pollutants in the form of wastes are anticipated to be bioconverted into the innocuous by-products with portions being assimilated to produce new biomass for growing mediators’ cells. In closing the loop, the generated biomass should be further exploited ABSTRACT Here we present three principles for effective materials and energy utilization based on the modified second law of thermodynamics: (1) If the potential of the system change, the potential of the surrounding will change in opposite direction, (2) The process that has largest change in potential will be the best one., and (3) The product from the smallest change in potential will be the highest value. These new criteria are realized through the parameter called the potential index (Θ *) assigned to explain natural processes in the world and identify preferable processes used instead of the typical efficiency parameter. In addition, the term integrates the knowledge of mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering by describing satisfactory transformation processes that are well-known in mechanical and electrical engineering, and also the increasing potential processes familiar in chemical engineering. Interestingly, such principles can also be applied for the management of ENTECH, Silpakorn University ABSTRACT During COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, we have found out that we did not have both factory and testing lab for the PPE. Fortunately, the governmental science service sector and the university have both practical professionals and sufficient equipment so we can adapt the available machines to perform several important tests to make sure that both N95 mask and coverall PPE meets the standards to protect our medics who are frontline in this situation. In addition, for the isolation gown and coverall PPE, we have all component in the supply chains starting from plastic production, film and laminated film factory and garment factories and all private sectors work closely for a greater good. However, there is still one more challenge, N95 mask production. From upstream (plastic production) midstream (meltblown nonwoven fabric production) and downstream (N95 mask fabrication line), at present, we have only one N95 mask production factory in Thailand which just began commissioning in late July 2020. We still have work to do to make sure that our medical staff will hav e high quality protective equipment.

df4876b2a7c5b488f4949705afc93f83b1bde2f5,Research on Analysis and Forecast of Truck Market in China,"For the modern enterprises, it is significant to develop production according to the market demand, and there is no exception to the auto companies. The article tries to establish a statistical model to predict the number of the truck ownership and provide references for truck manufacturers to make production plans. Thus, the situation of China’s truck market is introduced; the analysis of the overall trend of changes of the China’s truck market holdings is made; and the concept and classification of forecasting methods are introduced. For the prediction of the future of China’s truck market, researchers use quantitative and qualitative analysis, combining the advantages of both methods. Firstly, researchers find the relevant factors that affect laden car ownership through qualitative analysis. Secondly, on the further quantitative analysis, researchers determine main factors of the mileage of highways, infrastructure investment in fixed assets and amount of social consumption expenditure, etc. Thirdly, by the use of the above analysis results, multivariate regression model models are made, which is also the key part of the article. The last but not the least, analysis and comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of model are made eventually. Keywords-Truck; Auto Market Prediction; Model I. OVERVIE W OF TRUCK MARKET The automotive industry is a pillar industry in China, having more characteristics of the pillar industry in the “Eleventh Five-Year Plan”. According to the analysis of Deputy Minister of Industrial Economics Research Department of the State Council Development Research Center, China’s high growth industries have important features of economic growth in this round. Among the high growth industry herd, the consumption structure upgrading industries of automotive and housing, together with steel industries, form high-growth industries. According to economic trend of “Eleventh Five-Year Plan” period, it was predicted that China’s economy would maintain rapid growth, and the GDP growth rate would be around 8%. If it was calculated in accordance with constant price, the total GDP of China in 2010 reached $ 2.4 trillion. From 2010 to 2020, the growth rate is slower, with an average annual growth rate of 7%. In 2020, the total GDP will be $ 4.8 trillion. In 2010, due to the rapid development of automobile industry, automobile proportion of GDP was 1.4%. In 2004, it was 1.6%. In 2010, added value of the automotive industry to GDP ratio was more than 2% -2.5%. From the total amount, the features of automobile industry as a pillar industry will be more apparent. As one of the car categories, truck market holdings account for a proportion of about 40 percent of the entire car market. It has become an important part of China’s pillar industries. From Fig. 1, researchers can see the growth rate of ownership of the Chinese truck market. It shows that except negative growth of truck market holdings in 1995, the growth rate was more than 4% in other years. In 1991, there was a rapid growth of 11 %. In 2009, from the truck market holdings and the line column chart of grass domestic production. It can be seen that China’s truck market holdings and domestic GDP growth is roughly in the same trend. With the increasing growth of country’s GDP, China’s truck market holdings have also increased steadily from less than 4 million in 1989 to nearly 12 million in 2012, with an increase of more than 2 times. International Conference on Logistics Engineering, Management and Computer Science (LEMCS 2015) © 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 177 Figure 1. Chinese Truck Market II. TRUCK MARKET RESEARCH STATUS AT HOME AND ABROAD In China, during the planned economy period, the production plans of manufacturing companies were formulated by the country. The companies did not need to consider the relationship between market demand and supply. But now, in the market economy, manufacturing companies make their production plans by themselves and this requires manufacturers to understand the market trends and market demands [1]. Therefore, it is very important to forecast the market demand [2]. For this reason, over the past decade, articles of market demand forecasting have been increasing, and the measures of predicting are richer and deeper as well[3]. In recent years, automotive industry are becoming a pillar industry of the national economy, so experts and scholars have attached great importance to it[4-8]. As the important part of the automotive industry, trucks have become the focus. There are a number of publications of articles on the automotive market forecasting every year, many of which are analysis and forecast of the following two major truck subdivision markets, i.e. heavy trucks and medium trucks[9-12]. Due to limited space, researchers will not give specific analysis of the subdivision markets of trucks here. In summary, research methods used in articles of automotive market analysis and forecasting can be divided into four levels: The first level is qualitative analysis. As for truck demand forecasts, it is pointed out in articles that the situation of the national economy, investment in fixed assets, bank credit scale, road and urban construction and other economic and non-economic factors, affect the automotive market because they are directly or indirectly under impact of automotive industry and related industries [13-16]. The basic size and characteristics of truck market operation are formed under the influence of non-economic factors of economic policy and macroeconomic environment[17]. Prevailing macro-economic policies and non-economic factors are analyzed; forecasting conclusions are made thereafter [18]. Actually, approaches in the overwhelming majority of articles about the car market forecast, are qualitative analysis. The second level is analysis with the use of growth rate year on year [19-20]. Some experts calculated the growth rate of the previous period of the year, and analyzed several factors to promote the development of light-duty vehicles. These authors have concluded that the growth rate should have an increase and give the forecast value eventually. However, this method is relatively rare in prediction. The third level is the establishment of a single econometric model. Senior analysts said the domestic truck industry has two models. One is GDP and elastic model of market sales, and the other is an elastic model of the scale of investment in fixed assets and truck needs [21]. In addition to the elastic model, scholars have made use of other econometric models for automotive market analysis and forecasting [22]. Among all of these, time series models are established in trend extrapolation, nonlinear models of car ownership and the GNP are built in international analogy. Hence, the introduction of the model has greatly improved the accuracy of forecasts. The fourth level is utilization of several econometric models [23-24]. These models include multiple linear regression model, trend extrapolation model and time sequence. These methods of forecast are more accurate than single econometric model because market trends and factors that affect the market changes are all taken into account. III. MODEL SELECTION OF TRUCK MARKET FORECAST In general, all-time series are affected by historical information, regardless of linear or nonlinear influence. Forecasting of truck market holdings is also a time-series problem, and the future market holdings would be influenced by the previous market holdings.

503c535e80d3808c44630534d15e71a8711cb20b,"The Construction of Service-oriented College Student Management Platform Based on ""event-driven""","The comprehensive reform in the field of education is gradually implemented, and the educational management of students in universities as an essential part of it is in dilemma because of lacking a service-oriented college student management platform which is based on “event-driven”. College student management is showing situations of unsmooth information sharing in different departments, such as a low efficiency of management staff, and a limited function in the information transfer due to the defect in the third party communication software .Therefore, colleges and universities are due to expand the development of network and digital services, set up students management platform which is based on ""event-driven"", and set up a quality assurance mechanism. To form a platform which includes all of the above is good for colleges to pursue their management function to realize the change from control to service, and their management mode from the material-based management to human-based management. Keywords-event-driven; service-oriented college; management of students College student management is an important part of college management. With the rise of the network era and information technology, traditional college student management cannot meet the need of “People-oriented management”, that is, the need for students’ self development under the concept of service-oriented college management. It has been clearly pointed out in the Ministry of Education’s “Plan for ten-year development of Educational Information (2011-2020)” that “vigorously promote the construction of digital campus for normal colleges, improved digital platform for issuing information, network teaching, management services and on-campus cultural life as well as system integration and data sharing” [1] In this context, it is the requirement of the big data era and service-oriented colleges for student management to construct a service-oriented college student management and information platform based on “event driven” and it is also a effective strategy for colleges to positively face challenges to student management in the new situation. I. GOAL, BASIS AND TOOL: RESEARCHES INTO SERVICE-ORIENTED COLLEGES AND STUDENT EDUCATION MANAGEMENT PLATFORM BASED ON “EVENT -DRIVEN” Currently, China’s education field has already entered onto a new stage — stage of comprehensive management, and the field of h igher education’s student management is no exception. It is necessary and urgent to establish modern education governance system and improve internal governance structure of schools [2]. In order to carry out student management activities and realize “education for the people” education and management functional activities, colleges must update their management concept and change management model to seek the integration of student education’s management objectives, basis and management tools. While in order to achieve this integration, we must first clarify the goal, basis and tool for college student education management. A. Service-oriented Management is the Objective of College Student Management “Service-oriented colleges” has evolved from the concept of “service-oriented government” and is opposite to “control-oriented colleges”, which usually start from self-control and the convenience of management while colleges’ leading designers play a leading role in student management. It is the mandatory and unilateral practice of college managers as what services to be provided to teachers and students and how these services are provided without considering students’ own will and diversified demands. There is a “command-obedience” relation between college managers and students because students can not be subject to the will of managers, but service-oriented colleges are those colleges serving for students, taking serving for students as the theme for colleges to exist and development, and colleges are running guided by the “people-oriented management” concept. In terms of the current operation way of college student management system, it can be realized main ly through vertical linear management with a lack of effective multidimensional and mult ilayer interaction. Prominent International Conference on Logistics Engineering, Management and Computer Science (LEMCS 2015) © 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 1766 features of this management system are top-to-bottom order, direction, scheduling and control of student managers, that is, students obey and receive managers’ orders. Student managers at colleges have always been serving as the supreme “commander”, which is not conducive to reflect the function of services in student management [3]. It is just due to the reflection of emphasizing admin istrative service but not college students, the object of admin istrative services that college student management has yet not reflected the “people-oriented education” value of promoting the growth of students with a lack of analyzing college student management from people’s nature and promoting the concept of “people-oriented” management and “management for people” from the basic condition of human nature. “Management for people” is one of the main differences between higher educational management and management of other social organizat ions. Therefore, college student management should reflect that the core of “educating people as the basis” is to change the management mode from the “cost-oriented management” concept to the service-oriented student management with “people-oriented management” as the goal. B. “Event-driven” is the basis for Colleges to Realize the Function of Student Management At present, material management or institutional management (also called hard management) is the most common in college student management. That started from transactional management requirements, emphasizing control over students, one size fits all standard requirements of students. It is confined to transaction management, lack of concern for students' individual needs, ignoring the cultivation of the students' personality, enthusiasm and creativity. Lack of students as the most important resource in colleges and universities, student ability, talent, interest, psychological science, such as providing the most suitable service and management, and fully taking into account student growth in the management process of ""people management"". ""Event-driven"" is a strategic decision of continuity in management. In order to prevent the accumulation of time following the events of the current point in time, to mobilize available resources, solve emerging problems in the shortest amount of time, in the areas of public management, computer programming, economics is used. In the information age ""event"" is defined as a computer system for automat ic processing of information filtering as a standard, the system can be automatically processed and filtered for ""regular event"", instead of ""unexpected events"". ""Event drive"" to on event of sensitive and reaction, reaction real-time thinking of ""event drive"" concept completely can became upgrade University students education management level of a new thought, in other words, University to achieved itself students management to service type University of change, based on ""event drive"" is its based, not based on event drive, but still of ""sector drive"", students education management activities still will stay in procrastination rambling of old has State. University students management of ""event drive"" refers to that to prevent students management affairs stacked, improve students management efficiency, timely followed current time points occurred of event, using all can mobilization of resources, strengthening university management process in the of overall, and rates, and active of information passed, in University system within rates report important event, makes teachers and students, and admin istrative personnel bottom produced quickly, and has creative of response, with shortest of time solution students learning and life in the constantly appeared of problem. C. “Even-driven” Student Management Platform is a Necessary Tool for Current Service-oriented College Student Management On Amazon and Dangdang, people can browse a book or browse what other books, and according to the records of consumers search for books recommended to books of interest to searchers, and Google, Baidu search for records based on the users most want to see contents of the row at the top. [4] These sites and search engines than consumers, the search itself understand the preferences of its own, because of today's society, an age of mass production, sharing and use of data is opened. Based on the data unit, based on the cloud computing means of information storage, sharing, and mining, have a cheap and effective way to the large terminal data, high speed, storage, and analysis and calculation at any time. [5] Th is gives college students ' learning and life revolutionary and disruptive change. With the rise of mobile Internet and Smartphones as well as iPad, the popularity of mobile devices, such as college students get used to the way client Internet access through application, access to information and knowledge. The network era and the rise of information technology student management in colleges and universities is suffering the same challenge and excitement. Under the background of mass higher education, enrollment growth in student numbers at the same time, most college student counselor ratio imbalance, resulting in student management work ""Instructor live"" situation. Simple and labor-intensive ""human interaction"" type of ""student guide"" students ' management has been unable to meet large data on students ' management in the era of cloud computing's ""interactive"" requirement. Big data brings to the education ""one of the most important changes is that it makes the education management and more personalized service.

cdac347a3de363c377849a4f78a17601b4d1f1e0,"ComSoc's strategic planning for the ""smart revolution"" [The President's Page]","he environment surrounding the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) has been changing continuously, with the major thrust coming from technology and market changes. The days of telephone-based communications began to fade with the divesture of AT&T and privatization of telco businesses in the late 1980s. The decline of the telecom industry in the 1990s led to the decline in ComSoc’s membership. The proliferation of the Internet and the evolution of mobile communications transformed the telecom industry significantly, pushing several traditional telecom manufacturers out of business, which curtailed ComSoc’s advertising revenue and conference attendance. Yet another big blow came in the late 2000s from the convergence of communications and computers, whose symbolic outcome is the smart phone. This “Smart Revolution” invited new players such as Apple and Google to the communications arena along with brand-new business models centered on open applications stores. As an aftermath of the Smart Revolution, the communications market began to convert into a software and content driven market. Unfortunately, ComSoc has not yet been able to operationalize strategies to confront the challenges and opportunities of the Smart Revolution. The leadership of ComSoc already sensed that megatrend at the turn of this decade and began to bring in innovation and diversification to keep abreast of that change. ComSoc announced “ComSoc’s Golden Triangle” vision in 2010 and advocated the Society’s internal innovation by embracing globalization, industry, and young leaders. Then at the end of 2010, ComSoc announced “ComSoc’s Growth Engine” vision to expand the Society’s revenue sources to include the fields of education and online/mobile content, converged industry, and standards. Furthermore, at the end of 2011, after a year long team effort, ComSoc announced “ComSoc’s 2020” vision to envision the future of ComSoc in the drastically changing Smart Revolution environment. Until the end of 2011, ComSoc exerted much effort to realize the first two visions and, in fact, was able to make much progress in the areas of globalization, young leaders, standards, and education. Starting my term as the President this year, I invited Byeong Gi Lee, the 2010-2011 President, to chair the Strategic Planning Committee (SPC) during my presidency, and requested him to set midto long-term strategy to implement ComSoc’s 2020 vision (see the President’s Page in the November 2011 issue of IEEE Communications Magazine). Byeong soon organized a strong SPC team by inviting current and past top-level volunteer leaders of ComSoc (see Table 1). In particular, Byeong invited the five current Vice Presidents so they can start implementing the newly set strategies as soon as they are completed. Byeong then reviewed the ComSoc 2020 vision extensively and carefully, and came up with the following four key areas of focus during his term: 1) education programs, content, and services; 2) standards, industry programs, and services; 3) new technical values creation; and 4) serving members globally at the individual level. Based on that decision, Byeong divided the whole SPC job into four different categories (see Table 2) and formed four task groups to divide-and-conquer each job independently. I share this column with Byeong to introduce the direction and status of those four groups’ strategic plans. I briefly introduce Byeong below. Byeong received a B.S. degree from Seoul National University and a Ph.D. degree from UCLA. He worked for Granger Associates and AT&T Bell Laboratories before joining the faculty of Seoul National University, where he served as the Vice Chancellor for Research Affairs and the Director of the Institute of New Media and Communications. Byeong served as the President of the Korea Information and Communications Society (KICS), a Sister Society of ComSoc, as the President of the Korea Society for Engineering Education (KSEE), as a Vice President of the Accreditation Board of Engineering Education of Korea (ABEEK), and as the founding President of the Citizen’s Coalition for Scientific Society (CCSS) in Korea. He served as a member of several advisory groups including the Presidential Advisory Committee of Policy Planning and the Presidential Advisory Council on Science and Technology. During 2008-2010 he served as a Commissioner of the Korea Communications Commission (KCC). Within ComSoc, he was the 2010-2011 President and is currently serving as the chair of the Nominations and Elections Committee and the Strategic Planning Committee. Byeong has published seven textbooks, including Wireless Communications Resource Management (Wiley, 2009), and a large number of papers and patents. He has received several best paper awards, including the 1984 Myril B. Reed Best Paper Award, Exceptional Contribution Awards from AT&T Bell Laboratories, a Distinguished Achievement Award from KICS, the 2001 National Academy of Science (of Korea) Award, the 2005 Kyung-am Academic Award, the 2011 Grand Information and Communications Award, and the Order of Service Merit with Yellow Stripe from the Korean Government.

9efd9c69ad93918c68daa75bc40a387dd5cbfb49,Ageing in Europe: policies in harmony or discord?,"The rest of the European Union (EU) shares with the UK the experience of population ageing and for the same reasons. However, the rates at which ageing is taking place differs considerably between the Member States and, especially, between regions of the EU. In a large number of European regions the population had already stopped growing by the end of the last century. This will extend to the majority of EU regions, which will see their population levelling off or declining before 2015. The younger generation, the 0‐24 age group, represented 31.1% of the population in 1995, and this will decline to 27% in 2015 (some 11 million less). The older generation (65+) will increase, significantly and unevenly, throughout the EU. In some regions of France, Italy and Spain the 80 plus generation will represent between 7% and 9% of the population (compared with an average 3.9% in 1995). As a consequence the average age of the population will increase from 38.3 years in 1995 to 41.8 in 2015. The additional impact of migration means that, in some regions in eastern Germany, northern Italy, central France and northern Spain, the average age will be between 44 and 50 years. The growth of the very old (80+) will be the strongest, in terms of intensity. A large share of the total increase in this cohort over the next 25 years (plus 62% between 1995 and 2025) is taking place within the 5-year period 2000‐2005. Within those 5 years the increase will be above 25% in Belgium and France, and almost as much in Italy and Austria. The average increase in the EU will be 18.6%. Italy leads the way (yet again in demographic terms): in 2025, 7.1% or one in every 14 Italians, will be over 80. Germany comes next, due to the pre-war baby boom, and Denmark, Sweden and Ireland will follow after 2020. The eastern European countries are also experiencing demographic ageing. All of them, except Poland, will see a decline in the total population (and that of working age) before 2010. The EU shares demographic ageing with other world regions though, with Japan, it has the most pronounced trend over the next 20 years. Usually at this point in a demographic narrative some data showing age dependency ratios is presented. However, at best, such data are misleadingly crude and simplistic and, at worst, they may be harmful to the cause of rational policy debate. The policy implications of demographic change are not just a matter of the absolute numbers in different age groups. Firstly, it must be remembered that increasing longevity is an indicator of social and economic progress: a great triumph of civilization and, specifically, of science and public policy over many of the causes of premature death which truncated lives in earlier times. Therefore we should not bemoan the emergence of more balanced age structures but recognise that this unique phenomenon is one of the great achievements of the 20th century. At the same time it presents challenges to policy and practice in all sectors of society. Secondly, there is not a simple linear relationship between demographic change and the demand for spending on social protection, still less with the levels of such spending. For example, with regard to health and social care, the level of need for formal care depends on health status, marriage patterns, household composition and living arrangements. It is predicted that the number of disability-free years will increase in the next century 1 but the evidence so far is inconclusive. 2‐5 Other population trends provide a more certain picture. Older people living alone tend to make greater use of formal services than those living with others (partly because of the correlation between advanced old age and living alone) and, in the EU, there is an increasing proportion living alone. Given the primacy of family care it is likely that the growth in family breakdown and divorce among both older people and their children will have an impact on the demand for formal care but, again, the evidence is inconclusive. Similarly the increased participation of women in the labour force is likely to have affected the ability of the family to provide care; certainly it has increased the strains experienced by the primary carers who are invariably women. Although more older people in the EU today have children than in previous generations family size has declined dramatically over the course of this century and, therefore, the pool of potential family carers has shrunk. Declining fertility is a global phenomenon and is closely connected with economic development. The EU as a whole was already below the replacement rate 20 years ago and Europe as a whole was equal to the rate. One indicator of the implications for social care of these changes in fertility, in combination with the universal increase in longevity, is the parent support ratio (PSR)—the population aged over 80 divided by the population aged 50‐64. Because Europe aged earlier than other regions its PSR is the highest in the world and is likely to remain so for the next 25 years. 6",International Journal of Epidemiology,2002.0,20,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-pdf/31/4/758/18478808/310758.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/IJE/31.4.758?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/IJE/31.4.758, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7ba43f59006cb3db17047191ba2e22826560d97c,Talking about incontinence: the first step toward prevention and treatment.,"Among adult patients, discussions about incontinence are usually avoided because they evoke feelings of embarrassment, fear, shame, and the loss of independence.1 Incontinence has been associated with falls, functional decline, nursing home admissions, social isolation, and depressive symptoms,2,3 and patients often say, “Incontinence doesn’t kill you, but it takes your life away.” 
 
More than a quarter of older women in the United States and other developed countries experience urinary incontinence, with 5% to 15% experiencing daily episodes,4 making incontinence one of the most common medical conditions in this population. Most women manage incontinence on their own, with the minority (30%–45%) seeking care.5 Patients are not always comfortable broaching the subject with their clinician, so it can be a challenge to inform them about the condition and their treatment options. The Internet can be an empowering tool for individuals with incontinence and other stigmatized conditions because they can search for information anonymously. Although finding accurate and trustworthy health information online can be challenging, a number of excellent Web-based resources for patients and families are available that describe the etiology, natural history, and treatment options for in-continence.2 
 
In part because of its high prevalence, urinary incontinence accounts for approximately $20 billion in annual costs in the United States.6 Ten percent of these costs is spent on “routine care,” which includes absorbent pads, skin protection, and laundry. An older woman with incontinence can spend upward of $500 per year on routine care products, a cost that increases with more frequent incontinent episodes.6 Accordingly, effective treatment of incontinence may result in lower routine care costs. Although incontinence supplies are an insurance-covered benefit in several countries, such as Sweden, in the United States these costs are almost always paid for out of pocket, which places a large burden on elderly women, who are among the most economically disadvantaged in US society. Incontinence supplies are an allowed expense in medical flexible spending accounts (FSAs). However, this may be of little assistance given that employers provide FSAs and many older women are not employed. 
 
While the data from 2 large prospective studies representative of the community-dwelling elderly US population are not conclusive, urinary incontinence appears to be a marker of frailty in community-dwelling elderly persons and may be an independent risk factor for nursing home or skilled nursing facility admission.3 It is estimated that approximately 5% to 10% of nursing home admissions are attributable to incontinence, with these additional admissions accounting for up to 25% of the estimated annual costs of incontinence.6,7 Therefore, treating incontinence might help prevent or delay nursing home admissions and reduce the costs of incontinence. 
 
Many treatment options exist for women with incontinence, and the clinician should accommodate patient preferences for type of treatment and clarify the patient’s goals of treatment. Reduced incontinence frequency, volume of urine lost, or number of protective pads used each day—rather than continence—may be an acceptable goal for patients. Clinicians should direct patients who use the Internet to Web-based resources on incontinence and treatment.2 Behavioral treatments, such as Kegel exercises, biofeedback, and bladder control strategies, are the first line of treatment. Behavioral treatment strategies achieve similar efficacy as other nonsurgical treatments, have fewer risks and adverse effects compared with pharmacologic or surgical treatments, and are less expensive, making them well-suited for treating older women. 
 
In the United States, behavioral treatments, including discussions about diet, exercise, bladder training, and Kegel exercises, are reimbursed through the evaluation and management payment. Separate reimbursement is possible for biofeedback, but insurance coverage is inconsistent. In the United States, Medicare and many commercial insurers cover pelvic floor biofeedback (CPT 90911); some insurers consider it investigational, despite the evidence, and deny coverage, while others handle coverage on a case-by-case basis. In countries with public health systems, such as Australia and England, biofeedback is available and queues for treatment are often the only “cost.” In Australia, for example, patients can attend a physiotherapist in a private practice and either pay cash or seek reimbursement through a private health insurance fund, if possible. 
 
Women often struggle with initiating or maintaining these techniques. Several new technologies may enhance behavioral treatments such as bathroom finders, bladder diaries, and reminder applications that can be accessed through computers or smart phones. There are also social networking Web sites that are trying to make lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and diet, enjoyable and rewarding. Many of these applications are not specific to incontinence, but patients can adapt them as needed and consult their clinician if they have questions. 
 
Several medications and surgical procedures are available for women who prefer or need alternatives to behavioral treatments. However, the relative advantages among these options are less clear. Phase 3 drug trials usually enroll select samples of study participants and almost all are placebo-controlled, providing no data about how drugs compare with each other. Comparative effectiveness studies evaluating efficacy, adverse effects, and expense in broad samples, including older individuals and those with dementia, are needed. 
 
At present, policy experts have not developed a strategic plan for managing incontinence, and incontinence is not listed as part of the proposed objectives for Healthy People 2020. This is a missed opportunity given the prevalence, effects on quality of life, and the potential for prevention of incontinence. A 2007 National Institutes of Health state-of-the-science statement concluded that urinary incontinence may be prevented by lifestyle changes (namely, diet and exercise), by effective management of comorbid conditions (eg, diabetes, impaired mobility, depression), and by using pelvic floor muscle training and biofeedback.8 Obesity, for example, is a strong risk factor for prevalent and incident incontinence, and a behavioral intervention including weight loss and physical activity reduced the frequency of urinary incontinence episodes among overweight and obese women compared with a control group.9 
 
Treatment for incontinence can be effective and result in high patient satisfaction and improved quality of life. But it is only effective when sought, and too few women seek care. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services now track self-reported incontinence and care-seeking behavior among Medicare Advantage and commercial Medicare patients. These efforts will be critical for measuring progress in treating this condition as the US population ages. According to NCQA data, the percentage of women in commercial Medicare plans who discuss their incontinence with their physician increased from approximately 55% in 2003 to 58% in 2007.10 As is evident, there remains room for improvement. Clinicians should be proactive in asking about a patient’s continence status and initiating a prevention or treatment plan. Although incontinence is not a normal part of aging, talking about it should be.",Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA),2010.0,8,"{'url': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4445834?pdf=render', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1001/jama.2010.747?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2010.747, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

31ce6fe91fbe40c848aeb2d7e6a0830058cdb9e3,The potential for voluntary approaches to realize a climate smart economy: private-public partnerships in Taiwan,"From the early 1960s to 1980s, the economic structure of Taiwan shifted from one that was agriculture based to one that is industry based. Taiwan is considered a newly industrialized economy because it has successfully oriented its economy to exporting increasingly sophisticated goods and products. Taiwan’s reputation as an export leader is well known: over the past 20 years Taiwan has become one of the world’s most important manufacturers of high-tech products such as computers and other information technologies. In fact, the active support of export-oriented industries has made Taiwan the 16th largest trading union with a foreign exchange reserve of $262.9 billion, the third highest in the world (TEPA 2008a). However, rapid economic growth, escalating energy consumption, and rising carbon dioxide (COization. The energy supply totaled 141.92 million kiloliters (kL) of oil equivalent in 2007, of which 99.32 percent are imported (TBOE 2008). The main energy source is oil, which accounts for 51 percent of the total energy supply and is primarily imported from the Middle East. Other energy sources include coal (32 percent), liquid natural gas (LNG) (8 percent), nuclear power (8 percent), hydropower (<1 percent), and other non-hydro renewables (<1 percent). The amount of energy consumed has increased at the rate of about 5 percent each year for the past ten years (TBOE 2008). As a result of its extensive use of fossil fuels, Taiwan’s per capita GHG emissions are about 13 metric tons, which is about three times the world average. Taiwan emitted GHG of 305.7MTCO 2 e in 2006, of which 265.2MTCO 2 e were from burning fossil fuels. CO share of Taiwan’s GHGs at 90.9 percent, followed by nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4 ) and fluorocarbons (Figure 6.1). Power generation accounts for about 62 percent of emissions. If electricity use is allocated by economic sectors, the major polluter is the industrial sector, which accounts for around 53 percent of emissions, followed by the residential and commercial buildings sector at 18 percent, the transportation sector at 14 percent, and the energy sector at 7 percent (TEPA 2008a). Based on projected business-as-usual (BAU) scenario with high GDP growth, CO emissions are expected to reach 465 million tons by 2020. Since industry is responsible for the majority of emissions in Taiwan, corporate VAs can make significant contributions to emissions reductions. This indeed appears to be the direction in which Taiwan is moving. In response to increasing growth in emissions, the Executive Yuan (Taiwan’s cabinet) adopted national emissions goals in its “Sustainable Energy Policy Framework” in June 2008 (Hwang 2010). For the short-term goal, emissions are set to return to 2008 levels within the 2016 to 2020 timeframe. The medium-term goal is to return emissions to 2000 levels by 2025. The long-term goal is to lower emissions to 50 percent of 2000 levels by 2050. These policy goals will be used as a reference for the National GHG Reduction Program and the Sectoral Reduction Plans that will be drafted after the GHG Reduction Bill, currently being debated in Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan (Taiwan’s chief law making body), comes into force. In January 2010, the Executive Yuan Steering Committee established the “Energy Saving and Carbon Reduction Promotion Commission”, which later designed the “National Energy Conservation and Carbon Reduction Master Program”. Under this, Taiwan set up several voluntary targets including (i) reduction of at least 30% GHG volume over BAU scenario by 2020; (ii) reduction of carbon emissions to 2005 levels by 2020; (iii) at least 2 percent increase in energy efficiency annually with a minimum 20 percent reduction in energy intensity by 2015 and 50 percent reduction by 2025 as compared with 2005 levels (Chien et al. 2011). To establish a strong legal foundation for achieving the above targets, two legislations have been already formulated and two are being formulated. The “Energy Management Act” was amended in 2009 with a view to enforce high energy efficient facilities and products in industries. The “Renewable Energy Development Act” of 2009 was designed to promote low carbon energy supplies. The draft “GHG Reduction Bill” aims to establish a cap and trade system and the draft “Energy Tax Bill” of the Ministry of Finance aims to provide incentives for consumers to purchase low carbon high energy efficient facilities and products. In 2011, national departments and local governments developed as many as 230 action plans. By 2014, each local government is expected to initiate six low carbon cities or 50 low carbon communities, with the participation of both the public and private sector, schools and households within their jurisdiction. By 2020, four low carbon metropolitan areas are expected to be developed in each of the northern, central, southern and eastern parts of Taiwan. Enhancing community awareness of low carbon lifestyles is central to such efforts. The “Sustainable Energy Policy Framework” consists of an action plan that focuses on four sectors: energy, industry, commercial and residential buildings, and transportation. In the energy sector, the goals include obtaining 8 percent of energy from renewable sources and 25 percent from LNG by 2025, replacing old power plants, introducing carbon capture and storage (CCS) and letting energy prices reflect environmental externalities. In the industrial sector, the goal is to reduce per unit production carbon intensity by over 30 percent by 2025, and to create incentives for low carbon production systems and green industries. In the residential and commercial sectors, the actions include promoting urban tree planting programs, green building designs, raising appliance efficiency standards by 10 to 70 percent by 2015, and using lighting equipment with higher efficiencies. At the same time, green public transport systems and increasing efficiency in new vehicles by 25 percent in 2015 will be promoted in the transportation sector. As the future climate regime starts to take shape, both the government and business sectors share concerns that Taiwan might be subject to the next round of commitments under the UNFCCC, or to possible trade restrictions imposed through non-UNFCCC channels; these trade restrictions are arguably more likely since Taiwan is not obligated to cut emissions under the UNFCCC and may not be obligated to do so until an agreement can be reached on its participation in the United Nations. For instance, in order to maintain the competitiveness of their businesses, the electrical and electronics industries, which account for more than 50 percent of Taiwan’s production value, have responded to environmental directives introduced by the European Union (EU), including Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), and Energy Using Products (EuP) (TEEMA 2009). This example shows that potential trade restrictions, outside of international agreements, could impact Taiwanese businesses. Another example is Taiwan’s aviation industry, which is very likely to be affected by a proposed EU regulation requiring airlines that land on and take off from EU territory to cap their emissions as a part of the EU emissions trading scheme. Managers from the two major airline companies in Taiwan have expressed interest in possible voluntary emission reductions while seeking assistance from the government (personal communication, 23 February 2009). The above cases show that there are strong drivers for Taiwan’s industry sector to partner with the public sector and initiate VAs.",,2012.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4324/9780203141564?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203141564, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

44a059f7695cf5ad7479520f34b2234f05aa19a1,Engineering Education And The Global Economy: The Search For Policy,"Engineering education in the United States is confronted with some new realities, both real and perceived. Engineering is increasingly a globally distributed, cooperative activity and the US outsourcing of research, design, manufacturing, and construction overseas is growing. Further, the production of engineers in the United States is falling to around 5-6% of the global supply with clear signs that engineering education is available at lower costs, often far lower, in other countries. Many have viewed this globalization as a competitive situation for engineering education in the United States that we are losing. We will present the view that in terms of the quality of engineering education (which engineering educators can influence) as opposed to the global economy (about which we can do little), engineering education is still very strong in the US and likely to remain that way. However, we will present some recommendations based on our professional responsibilities in running programs in entrepreneurship, leadership, and design. In particular, we will review survey data collected from Penn State engineering graduates over the last decade which helps define new paths for integrating entrepreneurship, leadership and design into the engineering curriculum. We believe that there are some very real ways in which engineering education can, and should be, responding to the new requirements for success in professional engineering careers that derive from national needs as well as from the globalization of engineering. Introduction: Engineering Education in a Global Context 1 There are many different views of globalization and its significance. For example, in the forthcoming book, Global Tectonics, Ghadar and Peterson identify 12 major changes at work: population, urbanization, disease and globalization, resource management, environmental degradation, economic integration, knowledge dissemination, information technology, biotechnology, nanotechnology, conflict, and governance. 2 This list, in turn, is an expansion of the “Seven Revolutions” previously presented by the Global Strategy Institute of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS): population; resource management and environmental stewardship; technological innovation and diffusion; the development and dissemination of information of knowledge; economic integration, the nature and mode of conflict, and the challenges of governance. 3 In their convincing representation, the world is changing rapidly and in many ways that can affect engineering and engineering education. However, naming fields like nanotechnology and biotechnology appears to name strengths not weaknesses of the U.S. Nevertheless, there are signs that many in the engineering education community in the United States are becoming alarmed about the growing strengths of competitors in the global economy, particularly in Asia. For example, a recent report by the National Academy of Engineering, The Engineer of 2020, stresses the impact of globalization on the practice of engineering and the need for U.S. engineers to focus on innovative and creative aspects of the profession to be globally competitive. 4 This concern is being taken further with the new NAE report Rising Above the Gathering Storm, 5 the name apparently being a reference to the 2002 movie about Churchill’s prescience about the emerging war threat prior to World War II. ASEE and Design News have P ge 11551.2 also raised the issue. 6 And “a new survey of more than 4000 engineers conducted by a Portland firm reveals that most are pessimistic about the future of their professions, the state of the nation’s math and science education, and the ability of the US to retain its leadership in technology and innovation.” 7 Although we will question this view, there are real reasons behind such attitudes such as “the increasing trend of sending software and electronic design work overseas, and declining performance in math and science by American students compared with peers abroad. Observers note that among other remedies, federal funding for research needs to be boosted if the US is to remain competitive in engineering and technology; it has dropped from 1.25% of GDP in 1985 to 0.78% in 2003.” (Ibid) Often noted in discussions of engineering education and the global economy is the extraordinary growth of China’s economy and of its higher education system. Although half the graduates in China are engineers and scientists and China currently produces half of the world’s engineers, or five times the number produced in the U.S., there are some moderating factors. This rapid growth has created at least temporary employment issues for engineering graduates in China, and their population is, after all, about five times that of the U.S. One can also note that U.S. engineers are paid approximately five times as much as engineers in China. Thus, the total market value of graduating engineers in the U.S. is similar to that of Chinese engineers—for the time being. However, the per capita rate for the production of engineers in Japan and South Korea is even higher than in either the U.S. or China, and there is reason to study the relationship between the production of engineers and economic growth. 8 Finally, it is worth noting that any alarm felt by engineering educators will not resonate with all industry leaders and policy makers in the U.S. This is because there is a very high level of economic cooperation between the U.S. and China (as well as with Japan and South Korea), both for importing inexpensive manufactured goods that lowers U.S. inflation, and for return flows of dollars that finance the U.S.’s federal deficit. U.S. corporations, like those of other countries, have also been quick to see value in investing in China’s manufacturing base and pursuing opportunities in its domestic market. 9 A further corrective to the alarmist view was recently published in a well researched report by Gereffi and Wadha at Duke University, “Typical articles have stated that in 2004 the United States graduated roughly 70,000 undergraduate engineers, while China graduated 600,000 and India 350,000. Our study has determined that these are inappropriate comparisons. These massive numbers of Indian and Chinese engineering graduates include not only four-year degrees, but also three-year training programs and diploma holders. These numbers have been compared against the annual production of accredited four-year engineering degrees in the United States.” 10 Gereffi and Wadha recalculate the annual output for engineering degrees, including computer science and IT, to get a 2004 US figure of 137,437. The comparable 2004 figures for China and India are 351,537, and 112,000. (Ibid, p7) They note that the data imply that per every one million citizens, the United States is producing roughly 750 technology specialists, compared with 500 in China and 200 in India. P ge 11551.3 Another antidote to visions of a future with a million Chinese engineering graduates a year (Design News, 12/5/05), relates to quality. Few of China’s engineering graduates are considered competitive in the global economy, and many have trouble finding engineering work. And the domination of engineering and science in higher education in China has led to serious shortages in other fields that is hurting economic growth. The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) recently reported that “While university graduates are plentiful there, new MGI research shows that only a small proportion of them have the skills required for jobs further up the value chain—and competition for these graduates is becoming fierce. ... [and] unless the country addresses its looming labor shortage now the global ambitions of Chinese companies will probably be stymied.” 11 Another counterpoint for policy makers in U.S engineering education to consider is the health of the pipeline for engineers in the United States. Our graduates are getting jobs and salaries are up, although some suggest that “the job market for most scientists and engineers in the U.S. has fallen short of the job market in [other] competitive high level occupations.” 12 In the past, this availability of well-paid work has always driven the intake for engineering schools in the US. Recently there has been a weakening in the intake to many engineering schools due to a smaller demographic cohort and other factors, such as visa restrictions for international students. However, overall the trends and the signs are good, as “the proportion of the work force in engineering has trended upward, from 0.9% of the work force in 1950 to 1.8% in 2003. 13 Some argue that the weakening inflow of foreign students into U.S. universities may actually benefit U.S. graduates and firms as foreign educated engineers “remain overseas working with older or less productive technology”. 14 We are less sure of that dynamic given the diffusion rates of new technology, and it is difficult to measure. Regardless, U.S. engineering graduates still most often find work in the U.S. in small and large companies alike and in the public sector from civil infrastructure to mission agencies like Defense and NASA. We also have a glimpse of the global penetration in the workplace of our graduates. In a biennial survey of recent engineering graduates from Penn State reported below, we have found distinctly modest levels of importance in the respondents’ work assigned to “Importance of Working on an International Project.” Although this importance rating has been creeping up since the first survey of 1993 graduates, it is still below a 3 on a 5 point scale. Conversely, the respondents rated study abroad experiences highly (3.5 to 4.5) even if they did not have one, and most did not. So those surveyed have very positive attitudes towards engagement with the rest of the world, but they are not yet rating its significance to their work very highly. Both these findings would seem to challenge the view",,2006.0,3,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/1062.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--1062?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--1062, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
