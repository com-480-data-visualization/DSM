b9c7506fb495dc9d40da65fd696cc7d33c63e12b,Exploring the role of educational neuroscience in learning through the perspectives of adult vocational education students of computer science in the field of online learning. A case study,"Online learning had a decisive role in all levels of education during the pandemic. In this study, we will explore adult vocational education students of computer science that experienced the online education during the school academic year 2020–2021. The study attempts to explore the views of 10 adult students. At the same time, an attempt is made to determine the role of educational neuroscience in students' learning. Participants were asked to answer 14 questions about the online education they had experienced. This was followed by data analysis using NVivo software. According to the findings, 6 students identified the reasons why they prefer to be educated in a physical learning environment and 1 student stated that he prefers a mixed model that will include lessons with both physical and online presence. In addition, 9 out of 10 students stated that they prefer synchronous online teaching to asynchronous. Also, 7 out of 10 students identified that in the theoretical part they were able to achieve the expected learning outcomes but on the other hand, 6 out of 10 learners reported difficulties in attending the workshops. Nevertheless, 8 out of 10 stated that they were quite consistent with the obligations they had during the course. The findings indicate that the principles of educational neuroscience can be a critical component of effective online learning.","SouthEast European Design Automation, Computer Engineering, Computer Networks and Social Media Conference",2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/SEEDA-CECNSM53056.2021.9566229?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/SEEDA-CECNSM53056.2021.9566229, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7aa931c752ef2945fe7247533f06f3ef91259321,COVID-19 Vaccination: What Do We Expect for the Future? A Systematic Literature Review of Social Science Publications in the First Year of the Pandemic (2020–2021),"The Covid-19 pandemic has had wide-reaching societal and economic effects and a return to “normal” will take years to accomplish. In light of this situation, the most important advancement since COVID-19′s emergence has been the development of multiple, life-saving, vaccines. Academic research on vaccine has been extensive. It is estimated that in only one year it has been produced more published and indexed papers on this single issue than in the last twenty years on any other single issue, thus, necessitating some organization. This research consists of a systematic literature review of the social science publication on COVID-19 published in the first year of the pandemic (February 2020 to March 2021). This review is important because it occurs at a time when vaccines have begun their global distribution and the best efforts to address the pandemic is through vaccination programs. In this research, 53 papers published in relevant journals are analyzed out of the almost 30,000 articles retrieved from Scopus database. The analysis conducted relies on two different types: descriptive analysis (evolution at the time of citations; evolution over time of keywords; bibliographical mapping of countries, the top 10 most influential papers), and bibliometric analysis for content evaluation. A cluster analysis was performed for the latter. Clustering the research papers, based on the actual content of papers, found there to be five research areas: (1) economic aspects; (2) ethics and legal aspects; (3) health communication; (4) policies and crisis management, and (5) political issues. Yet, this article’s results paint a picture of literature that has not yet considered the full scope of COVID-19’s effect on the economic, political, and population level health and well-being. Nor has it considered these effects across the global community, suggesting new potential areas of research and giving a perspective of what we should expect for the future.",Sustainability,2021.0,8,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158259', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/su13158259?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158259, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

32e809d34a713b40f00316818eb4873d2b7e7f6e,The year 2021 of the International Journal of Innovation – IJI,"The International Journal of Innovation: IJI has been making some changes in recent years and, therefore, increasingly improving its content. These are transformations that would not be possible without the incessant collaboration of the entire IJI team. Ther are always tireless and impeccable. It would not be possible without all the articles submitted by the authors who believe and choose the IJI for their publications. It would not be possible either, without the reviewers who contribute with a lot of dedication, spending their time and knowledge on improving the articles to publish the IJI. We are immensely grateful to everyone! Special thanks to UNINOVE, who have always supported and continue to support IJI.At the end of 2021, we would like to present some data and information that enable readers, authors, and reviewers to follow the evolution of the IJI. We remain dedicated to raising the bar for the IJI. IJI is in the main databases: Dialnet, EBSCO, ERIHPLUS, Latindex, ProQuest, Redalyc, Redib, Spell, Web of Science and Zeitschriften Datenbank. It is classified in stratum B1 of the new QUALIS/CAPES proposal. It is published every four months (January-April; May-August; September-December) and accepts submissions in Portuguese, English, and Spanish, and published in English only.The International Journal of Innovation: IJI's mission is to serve as a vehicle for the periodic publication of scientific and technological works in innovation with a focus on emerging markets, which study individuals, organizations, ecosystems, and policies. The journal's topics of interest focusing on emerging markets are Innovative Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Learning, Innovation and Sustainability, Internationalization of Innovation, Innovation Systems, Emerging Themes of Innovation, and Digital Transformation. As we have already mentioned in another editorial comment, the IJI accepts scientific articles, technology articles, perspectives, and reviews, in addition to the editorial comment.We now present some data from IJI submissions for this year, 2021 (Table 1). Table 1Submissions to the IJIWorks submitted87Rejections65%Acceptance35% Eighty-seven works were submitted to the IJI, of which 65% were rejected and 35% were approved. With these numbers, we observe that rejection is still high. The rejection happens; most of the time, in the desk-reject the editors perform that. The reasons are: a) the submitted works are not following the scope of the IJI; b) the submitted works do not meet the minimum requirements for a publication and are not considered to proceed to a peer review and blind.When articles move to the stage of blind and peer review, the number of rejections gets smaller. Generally, works are rejected at this stage when the authors do not comply with the evaluators' recommendations. Our intention is, with the help of reviewers and authors, to increasingly improve the quality of submitted articles and increase the number of publications in the IJI.Submissions are from different countries. In this year of 2021, we had the following scenario (Table 2). Table 2Submissions to the IJI - by countryCountrySubmissionsBrazil59Argentina1Colombia1Cuba1Algeria2Indonesia2India3Jordan1Sri Lanka1Mexico1Malasia1Nigeria3Portugal2Saudi Arabia3Tunisia1Turkey1Ukraine1Vietnam2South Africa1TOTAL87 The most significant works submitted are from Brazilian authors, but with a balanced distribution among other countries. We are happy that the IJI is considered a possibility for authors from different countries on our continent and other continents. We want to increase the number of foreign submissions and their publications. We believe that this action is important for the academic community due to the diversity of contexts.The IJI counts on the valuable availability of the evaluators, who we know have to dedicate their precious time to help us improve our work. Our evaluation time is still high, up to 98 days. Some reasons impact this deadline: a) the reviewers are very demanding with researchers with little experience, causing back and forth in the assessments until they reach the expected quality for the article; b) holidays in the middle of the year and at the end of the year delay the evaluations a little; c) evaluators also divide their time with evaluations of academic events throughout the year. Due to these reasons, the publication of the works is also compromised. We took up to 122 days to publish the articles.Another interesting piece of information that we would like to share with our readers is the number of registered users of IJI. IJI has 1270 registered users, including authors, reviewers, and readers. In the last year of 2021, there were 534 new users. It makes us very happy, as the number of users has almost doubled. This action makes us hope to have more works submitted and, consequently, more quality works published.We aim to improve and make the IJI a journal with more impact in the academic and practical environment. With the help of everyone involved, we will improve the level of evaluations and significantly improve the published works. We want to bring relevant content that contributes to science in Brazil and other countries around the world.We thank you all for your help and support in this growing IJI journey!",International Journal of Innovation,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.5585/iji.v9i3.21112', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5585/iji.v9i3.21112?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5585/iji.v9i3.21112, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The conference had more than 1200 participants and presented many interesting topics, sessions and workshops. The 10 workshops and roundtable discussions could be presented in a live format and, as well, a virtual face-to-face talk was possible. But of course we missed the ceremonial social evening and the nice conversations during the coffee breaks. On the one hand, the conference focused on animal facility management topics such as dealing personally and emotionally with the issue of animal experimentation, and challenging public relations, as well as hygiene management and staff training. On the other hand, we offered animal experimentation topics such as the performance and impact of behavioural tests, opportunities and problems with imaging techniques, stress assessment in laboratory animals, the topic of 3Rs with special attention to replacement and supplementation methods, transparency in experimentation and the importance of the microbiome of laboratory animals. For the first time, we addressed the very specific challenges researchers have when working with wildlife or planning field trials with livestock. IGTP addressed current topics such as automation in animal husbandry, refinement in laboratory animal science, rehoming of laboratory animals and news about feeding problems. The virtual industry exhibition provided expanded opportunities to interact with attendees and offered an interesting rally for the participants. A big advantage of the virtual format was that all participants had the opportunity to see as many presentations as possible, since the recorded presentations were available for two weeks after the end of the conference. So parallel lectures could be viewed, which would not have been possible at a presence conference.

Low nutritional literacy can have an impact on a poor diet and lead to the incidence of non-communicable diseases related to nutrition, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. College students are prone to develop poor eating habits if not supported by good nutrition literacy.Objectives: This study measured the difference in the proportion of nutritional literacy in regular active undergraduate students at the University of Indonesia based on the cluster of science, gender, paternal and maternal education level, pocket money, and media use.Methods: The study design used is a cross-sectional design with quota sampling method to get 130 samples of students from Health Science Cluster and 130 samples of students from Non-Health Science Cluster.Results: The results of this study showed that the majority of the University of Indonesia students in 2021 has an adequate level of nutrition literacy (62.7%). The results of the bivariate analysis also showed a significant difference in proportion to the level of total nutrition literacy based on cluster of science (OR = 6.7, p-value < 0.01), gender (OR = 2.25, p-value < 0.01), and media use (OR = 4.36, p-value < 0.01). In addition to these factors, there was also a difference in proportion between the level of interactive nutrition literacy based on maternal education level (p-value < 0.05)Conclusions: Students from non-health science cluster are at risk of having a lower level of nutrition literacy compared to students from health science cluster.

130378b2f6bbe51cdc108897b48954a34d8fd838,Publication Trends of Research on Retinoblastoma During 2001–2021: A 20-Year Bibliometric Analysis,"Background: Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood. Despite high survival and eye salvage as the result of various types of therapies, retinoblastoma remains a disease that places a considerable burden on developing countries. Our study attempted to analyse the research trends in retinoblastoma research and compare contributions from different countries, institutions, journals, and authors. Methods: We extracted all publications concerning retinoblastoma from 2001 to 2021 from the Web of Science database. Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer were employed to collect publication data, analyse publication trends, and visualize relevant results. Results: A total of 1,675 publications with 30,148 citations were identified. The United States contributed the most publications (643) and citations (16,931 times) with the highest H-index value (67) as of February 4, 2021. China ranked second in the number of publications (259), while ranking fourth in both citations (2,632 times) and the H-index (26) ranked fourth. The British Journal of Ophthalmology was the most productive journal concerning retinoblastoma, and Abramson DH had published the most papers in the field. Keywords were categorized into three clusters; tumor-related research, clinical research, and management-related research. The keywords “intravitreal,” “intraarterial,” and “intravenous” appeared the most frequently, with the average appearing year being 2018.1, 2017.7, and 2017.1, respectively. Management-related research has been recognized as a heavily researched topic in the field. Conclusion: We conclude that the United States, China, and India made the most exceptional contributions in the field of retinoblastoma research, while China still has a disparity between the quantity and quality of publications.

In another sense, it only seems a few weeks ago when I was pondering about what the impending pandemic meant for research on the applications of history, philosophy, and sociology of science in science education. Our experience of time can seem distorted and confused at times during this pandemic, as evidenced by the typographical error in that editorial where I referred to my doctoral student’s research taking place in February 2019 when only 1 month had elapsed. Time seems to have taken a different meaning in our everyday lives, but can “time” emerge from its benign presence in our research endeavours to become a focus of investigation for science education? In a recent paper, Levrini et al. (2021) have explored precisely this question by referring to concepts such has “alienation from time”, “time re-appropriation”, and “era of future shock” and drawing on perspectives from sociology of time to understand how students’ daily rituals in schools detach their science learning from broader societal issues. Such concepts are providing us with new ways of interpreting what the pandemic has meant for science education in the past year. Indeed, the pandemic context is helping researchers galvanize new and fresh perspectives on how to understand and improve science education to make it relevant for today’s circumstances. In this issue of Science & Education, Pietrocola and colleagues characterize the Covid-19 pandemic as “manufactured risk”. The authors question new roles for science education based on “risk society theory”, a conceptual framework that can act as a tool for understanding how to align science education with the contemporary demands on problemsolving. They argue that students are unable to deal with manufactured risk because of the type of problems they are usually prepared to solve at school and the limited risk perception they possess. The authors propose the integration in science courses of “wicked problems” with a multidimensional schema that they refer to as “amplified risk perception space” in order to identify and assess students’ risk perception.

6c19c766fecae5deecaadd5cd7311617915fbd8b,Ten new insights in climate science 2021: a horizon scan,"Non-technical summary We summarize some of the past year's most important findings within climate change-related research. New research has improved our understanding about the remaining options to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, through overcoming political barriers to carbon pricing, taking into account non-CO2 factors, a well-designed implementation of demand-side and nature-based solutions, resilience building of ecosystems and the recognition that climate change mitigation costs can be justified by benefits to the health of humans and nature alone. We consider new insights about what to expect if we fail to include a new dimension of fire extremes and the prospect of cascading climate tipping elements. Technical summary A synthesis is made of 10 topics within climate research, where there have been significant advances since January 2020. The insights are based on input from an international open call with broad disciplinary scope. Findings include: (1) the options to still keep global warming below 1.5 °C; (2) the impact of non-CO2 factors in global warming; (3) a new dimension of fire extremes forced by climate change; (4) the increasing pressure on interconnected climate tipping elements; (5) the dimensions of climate justice; (6) political challenges impeding the effectiveness of carbon pricing; (7) demand-side solutions as vehicles of climate mitigation; (8) the potentials and caveats of nature-based solutions; (9) how building resilience of marine ecosystems is possible; and (10) that the costs of climate change mitigation policies can be more than justified by the benefits to the health of humans and nature.

The purpose of this study was to determine the level of emotional intelligence and the level of student achievement, as well as to determine whether there is a significant relationship between emotional intelligence and student achievement in social studies subject class IX SMP Negeri 10 Samarinda in the academic year 2021/2022. Sampling in this study used a probability sampling technique with proportional random, namely 78 students from 326 students of class IX SMP Negeri 10 Samarinda. The type of research used is quantitative research with a correlational approach. In an effort to collect data (research instruments), the author uses a Likert scale, namely the emotional intelligence scale which refers to the 5 (five) elements of emotional intelligence and documentation of student report cards to determine the value of learning achievement. Testing the validity of items and elements on the emotional intelligence scale was carried out by expert validation. To find the correlation between the two research variables, Pearson's Poduct Moment correlation was used and the analysis used the computer-assisted SPSS 23 for Windows program. Based on the results of the study, it showed that there was a significant relationship between emotional intelligence and student achievement in class IX of SMP Negeri 10 Samarinda. From the results of the calculation analysis, the value of sig = 0.000 and rcount = 0.407 means that the value of sig 0.000 < 0.05 and rcount is consulted with the rtable of product moment known to be at a significant level of 5% = 0.222, which means the value of rcount = 0.407 > rtable = 0.222.

81fa178cd2d95bd8cea0d7e4af82edab92750497,Year 2021 – the year of hope and health care workers,"I am writing this on the 30th of January 2021. Exactly one year ago the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, the highest level of alarm under international law. To date, there have been more than 100 million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) including over 2 million deaths [1] and countless numbers of grief and sorrow. But – at the same time – we now have new hope that vaccination will put an end to this global tragedy. Yet here we are amidst the greatest health care crisis of our generation. Clinicians all over the world take care for and cure the patients infected by COVID-19. Health care professionals are facing huge emotional stressors including grief from seeing patients die, fears of getting infected by the virus and infecting their close ones. Many non-clinician experts, epidemiologists, virologists, and immunologists have provided a surge of information to lead us through this catastrophe. The pace at which the clinicians have adapted to this new knowledge is astonishing. Digital communication platforms have helped us to keep a distance from each other, but these new types of software may also turn out to be additional sources of stress. On top of this all, primary health care has to face the physical, mental and socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic, which certainly will affect peopl es needs and access to care in the years to come. In the light of all this, it seems correct and reasonable that WHO has designated 2021 the International Year of Health and Care Workers ‘in recognition of their dedication to providing care during and despite the COVID-19 pandemic’ [2]. Beyond offering praise and applause, WHO aims to draw attention of the member states to the need for greater investments in health and care workforce. In Nordic countries, governments should above all address the shortfall in primary care personnel. Even before the pandemic, general practitioners (GPs) got increased work responsibilities [3], and a substantial proportion of GPs reported symptoms of burnout and decreased job satisfaction [4–6]. A recent Norwegian study about motivational experiences of the GPs concluded that GPs should be able to expect that authorities share their strong sense of moral duty and improve the structural frames of their work environment [7]. Attending this goal is now on the agenda of WHO, too. We all should pay more attention to our work wellbeing and supporting our colleagues. GPs too often feel that physical and emotional exhaustion is part of the job. We too often share the ethos that vulnerability is a sign of weakness. This is especially strenuous for the young physicians. In Finland, participation in a Balint group is nowadays recommended during the specialty training in general practice. Clinicians tend to accept support from colleagues who understand the stressors of the occupation [8]. Thus, we should more often ask our colleagues: ‘How are you holding up?’ Year 2021 must be the turning point of the COVID-19 pandemic, it restores all hope and faith for the good times to return. Hopefully year 2021 can promise even more; faith for true science, and better well-being for health care workers.",Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care,2021.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02813432.2021.1922830?needAccess=true', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8293938, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The What’s Hot in Literacy annual survey asks twenty-five leading experts what literacy topics are currently receiving attention, or are hot, as well as which topics should be hot in the field. The results of these interviews are tallied to identify consensus among the participants. The following three levels are used to report the findings: a) “extremely hot” or “extremely cold” (100% consensus), b) “very hot” or “very cold” (75% consensus), and c) “hot” or “cold” (50% consensus). Items are identified as “should be hot” or “should not be hot” if at least 50% of the respondents agree. The four “very hot” topics for 2021 are digital literacy, dyslexia, phonics/phonemic awareness, and social justice/equity/anti-racism in literacy. Discussion of these topics (and others that were deemed should be hot) and why they may be currently receiving more attention than others in the field is included.

The third conference of the network was likewise planned for June 2020, but it was delayed for one year because of the pandemic. Select papers from each conference have been published in special issues of various journals – this year they will be published in International Studies in the Philosophy of Science (ISPS). The participants joined from all over the world, which also fulfilled one of the main aims of the network: to foster connections between philosophers of science working in Central and Eastern Europe (the network’s focal region) and those working inWestern Europe and elsewhere. The conference provided a good variety of topics, ranging from general philosophy of science to philosophy of specific sciences, history and philosophy of science, formal philosophy of science, and philosophy of mathematics and logic, and had two keynote talks, given by Anna Alexandrova (University of Cambridge) and Gerhard Schurz (University of Düsseldorf).

There were some organizational and technical changes at the beginning of 2021, of which we would like to inform the readers and authors of the IJES. Changes in the IJES co-founders composition. The co-founders composition changed in March 2021: Information Agency PROK, Latvian Republic – Ukraine and Melnyk Yuriy Borysovych, Ukraine were replaced by a new co-founder Kud Aleksandr Aleksandrovich, Ukraine. Re-registration is taking place in the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine. Expansion and specification of scientific directions of the IJES. Today’s realities required combination and specification of scientific directions in the field of social and behavioral sciences the IJES is dedicated to. Such scientific directions as Social and Behavioral Sciences: Education, Economics, and Law were specified to ensure further more in-depth professional specialization of the IJES. Thus, the IJES remains a scientific periodical peer-reviewed indexed journal providing a scientific platform for presenting and discussing new trends and problems in the social and behavioral sciences. For the previous three years, the IJES was published only in two languages (English and Ukrainian). In 2021, the Editorial Council decided to publish the IJES in three languages, namely in English, Ukrainian and Russian. Changes in the format of scientific papers in the IJES. Due to the change in the number of languages in which the IJES will be published, as well as new trends, including regarding the references format (APA Style (APA 7th)), the requirements for paper format have been changed.

The conversations were intended to inform our understanding of how the pandemic had impacted the research enterprise and to share information about how institutions were planning to shape investments and strategies surrounding the research enterprise going forward. Previous Roundtables were held in April and September 2020 and reports from those conversations are available from http://www.cni.org/tag/executive-roundtable-report. As with the earlier Roundtables on this topic, June participants primarily included senior library administrators, directors of research computing and information technology, and chief research officers from a variety of higher education institutions across the US and Canada; most participating member institutions were public universities with high research activity, though some mid-sized and private institutions participated as well. The June Roundtable took place in a single convening, supplemented by an additional conversation with a key institution unable to join the group meeting due to last-minute scheduling conflicts. As before, we urged participants to think about research broadly, encompassing the humanities, social sciences, and fieldwork activities, as well as the work that takes place in campus laboratories or facilities shared by broader research communities; indeed, the discussions occasionally considered adjacent areas such as the performing arts. The discussion was wide-ranging, including, but not limited to: the challenges involving undergraduate, graduate and international students; labs and core instrumentation; access to physical collections (libraries, museums, herbaria, etc.) and digital materials; patterns of impact on various disciplines and mitigation strategies; and institutional approaches to improving research resilience. We sensed a growing understanding and sensitivity to the human toll the pandemic has taken on the research community. There were several consistent themes throughout the Roundtable series, but shifts in assumptions, planning, and preparation have been evident as vaccination rates have increased and as organizations have grown somewhat more confident in their ability to sustain largely in-person operations by fall 2021. Still, uncertainties abound and considerable notes of tentativeness remain, and indeed, events subsequent to the Roundtable, such as the large-scale spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in the US, have eroded much of the confidence we heard in June 2021, though probably more around instructional strategies than the continuity of the research enterprise. The events of the past 18 months, combined with a growing series of climate change-driven disruptions, have infused a certain level of humility into institutional planning, and they continue to underscore the importance of approaches that emphasize resilience and flexibility.",,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.56561/mwrp9673', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.56561/mwrp9673?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.56561/mwrp9673, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We have already reached the end of our 2nd year of existence as the first new journal to add to the BJUI family. We are a fully digital, open access journal that is fully peer reviewed to the same standards as the BJUI. We accept all subspecialties within clinical urology and group our papers by our four key “directional” compass themes of review articles, clinical utility, academic progress, and surgical innovation. Our board consists of an editor, two Associate Editors, and 12 Consulting Editors. All accepted papers go online quickly after formatting and are then assigned an issue. Our social media editor is Zainal Adwin who tweets summaries of our papers, and we have a YouTube channel for video supplements any authors want to post. Papers submitted to BJUI Compass come by many routes: Approximately 35% are transferred from the BJUI as suitable content for BJUI Compass and the remaining from direct submissions. An increasing number of author groups are finding they have article charges covered by their institution’s open access agreements with Wiley and the list is posted via links from our website. We strive to cover all aspects of urology and last year saw an equal 50:50 ratio of submissions from urologic oncology to functional/other areas of urologic practice. Of course, our initial issue in March 2020 coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, and a number of articles are now available on the effect of the pandemic on urologic practice. Our initial issues had at least four articles/issue, and this past year, we are at around eight/issue. Overall, we had 71 submissions in 2020 and this year on pace for 90. In conclusion, it has been a satisfying growth trend for BJUI Compass. We look forward to furthering the science in our field in 2022.

60ed81ebcfa99ef19e963184affab6dce7cec72b,Abstracts from the 131st Meeting of the Tennessee Academy of Science November 2021,"Adam Holley grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, but attended college in Pennsylvania, where he earned a B.S. in physics and mathematics from Haverford College. Uncertain about whether theoretical or experimental physics was right for him, he temporized by teaching high school physics in New York City, where he had the good fortune to collaborate on the development and teaching of a three-year research course for high school students. That experience ultimately helped him decide to become an experimentalist. This he did at North Carolina State University, joining a group of scientists developing the United States' first ultracold neutron (UCN) source at Los Alamos National Lab. He earned his Ph.D. as part of the associated UCNA experiment that for the first time used UCN to measure the neutron beta decay asymmetry. During his subsequent postdoc at Indiana University, Dr. Holley got involved in another beta decay experiment called UCNτ. He continued his involvement with that effort when he joined the faculty at Tennessee Tech, where he leverages unique aspects of UCN physics to involve undergraduates in the work.
 The Tortoise and the Hare: A Race for Answers to Big Questions about the Universe
 The production of energetic exotic particles has long been a primary method for discovering the rules that underlie what we observe about the universe. There are, however, a number of gaps in this understanding, which the study of more familiar systems, such as neutrons, atoms, or molecules, can help elucidate. As the overall precision of these experimental efforts increases, there are a growing number of tantalizing anomalies, any of which could point the way to a shift in our understanding of how the universe formed, what makes it up, and whether ours is the only universe or is one of many universes. The race to discover new fundamental physical behavior currently features a diverse array of high-precision approaches, spanning an enormous range of energies. “Ultracold” neutrons (UCN), with twenty orders of magnitude smaller energies than particles produced at the Large Hadron Collider, provide one example of how low-energy measurements can facilitate the requirement for high precision. A classic example of a UCN-based experiment is determination of the free neutron lifetime, an empirical observable involved in a number of potentially interesting anomalies. An experiment called UCNτ that operates at Los Alamos National Laboratory has set the standard for precise determinations of this quantity. Using UCNτ as an example of the physics, engineering, and computational challenges high-precision work entails, this talk will describe the ongoing race to answer some long-standing questions about the universe.",Journal.

436ec33d2dfd7741b2b9d559043f3cb3f25fbf42,British Journal of Biomedical Science in 2021. What have we learned?,"The British Journal of Biomedical Science in its attempts to continue to make steps forward as a leading international journal, has seen a significant rise in its impact factor (IF) rating over the past year. The IF figure for 2019 was 2.712 and for 2020 it has risen to 3.829 (Figure 1). Within the category of medical laboratory technology, the journal is now ranked 6 out of 29. These data mark a significant improvement in the academic standing of the journal as compared to many of its direct rivals. The emphasis on focussing on practice, research and education in all aspects of biomedical science and its application to the study of human disease and treatment continues to remain its primary objective. As well as focusing on the scope and full range of scientific disciplines within pathology, the journal has also made significant steps to embrace the importance of molecular techniques and how these methodologies have increased our understanding of disease processes. There is also a significant attempt to keep pace with the changing scope of molecular techniques and how their constant evolution brings an ever increasing armoury of investigative tools that can be applied across a wide spectrum of pathological entities, constantly challenging traditional discipline-specific perspectives to research and development. As seen throughout the articles published in 2021, volume 78 of the British Journal of Biomedical Science (BJBS) the molecular techniques discussed are often applied as an investigative tool to determine the clinical relevance of genes in an organism’s genome employing genetic screens. It also emphasizes the increasingly important role this technology has across all the traditional biomedical science disciplines. This approach helps us to understand how molecular genetics can be used as a powerful methodology for linking mutations to genetic sequences, may aid the search for treatments and or possible cures for various genetic based abnormalities. Many conditions and illnesses still cause considerable misery and suffering. Better laboratory diagnostics are therefore needed to provide more accurate information and lead to improved patient care – the aim being to provide for a higher quality of life for individuals with these conditions. Moreover some of the molecules and approaches described in the journal, such as analysis of micro-RNAs and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for a range of genes, may appear esoteric to many of us working in the laboratories, where more traditional methods hold sway. The important point here is to realize the pace of change in this area and also to recognize the importance of ‘biomarker’ studies as complementary to experimental studies on cell lines and animal based studies approach in the field, thus enabling a more synergistic approach to the study of disease mechanisms and pathological processes generally (Figure 2).",British Journal of Biomedical Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1080/09674845.2021.1982279', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/09674845.2021.1982279?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/09674845.2021.1982279, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ba184a2e353ff22764904eac9d2821bf99191e14,Library and information science research in the Arab World: a bibliometric analysis 1951–2021,"
Purpose
This study aims to investigate the research productivity of library and information science (LIS) authors affiliated with the 22 countries of the Arab League. It also identifies the top countries, organizations, authors, journals, natures of collaboration, and frequently used keywords in LIS research in the Arab world.


Design/methodology/approach
Bibliometric methods were used to evaluate the research performance of the authors affiliated with library organizations in the Arab region. The Elsevier Scopus database was selected for data retrieval. A comprehensive search strategy was adopted to retrieve 863 publications contributed by LIS authors affiliated with the Arab countries. VOS viewer, Biblioshiny, BiblioAnalyitics, Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel were used for data visualization and analysis.


Findings
This paper presents the dynamics and the state of the LIS research in the Arab region published between 1951 and 2021. The results of the study have highlighted an upward trend in the growth of the publications, especially in the past four years. The largest number of studies were published in the year 2020. The country-wise analysis ranked Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as the top LIS research producing countries with five and four researchers, respectively. The Kuwait University, the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals and the Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University were the three most productive organizations. Academic libraries, social media, bibliometrics, information-seeking behavior, information literacy and knowledge management were identified as the major areas of interest for the researchers. Internet and open access were topics that had gained recent popularity, while the digital library, research data management, green librarianship, link data, cloud computing, library leadership, library automation and artificial intelligence were identified as areas requiring further attention. Furthermore, the single-author pattern was found to be the most preferred pattern.


Practical implications
The findings of this study would help prospective researchers in choosing the neglected areas of research that require further investigation. They would also help policymakers in identifying factors that need more attention and allocation of research funds.


Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first comprehensive bibliometric study that presents a holistic picture of the LIS research in the Arab region.

The present research was defined with the aim of analyzing the degree of satisfaction and perceptions on the establishment of bubble groups and pairs and on the use of audiovisual platforms for the development of theoretical and practical university teaching in three degrees of health sciences. A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on a representative sample of students and teachers of health sciences in Ponferrada (n = 285). Specific questionnaires designed for this study were completed virtually during April and May 2021. The results indicate that that satisfaction was moderate–high. The perception of the influence of bubble pairs on the quality of teaching can be interpreted as very low. These results increase with the age and academic and professional experience of students and faculty members, respectively. However, the participants belonging to physiotherapy considered that the quality of teaching had worsened much more compared to their counterparts in nursing and podiatry.","European Journal of Investigation in Health, Psychology and Education",2021.0,6,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe11030076', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8544224, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ca5e36fa3cc5979c4b473480a6e84a78d2d2be3d,27th NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC PRACTICAL CONFERENCE “NATURAL SCIENCE EDUCATION IN A COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL – 2021”: CONFERENCE REVIEW,"The scientific-practical conference “Natural Science Education in a Comprehensive School - 2021”, which has already become a tradition, was held in an unusual way, remotely (online). This format of the conference was determined by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, so the conference could not take place in the usual format for the second time. This time, the plenary session of the conference was truly international and extremely interesting. In total, four key reports were presented in plenary. 
It is fair to say that the plenary has 'united' different continents: Africa (presenter: Dr Angela James from South Africa), Latin America (Dr Solange Locatelli from Brazil), Europe (Dr Mihail Calalb from Moldova and Dr Malgorzata Nodzynska from Poland). It is also interesting that the plenary reports covered all three essential areas of science education - chemistry, physics, biology.
The topics of the reports were various, mainly in various fields of science and technology education. It is important that the participants were active, there were intense discussions and sharing of experiences. All participants acknowledged that education in a pandemic environment is significantly restricted. This applies in particular to various non-formal education activities, or activities that take place outside the regular classroom (e.g. various project activities). 
Presentations were also made on the second day of the conference. Dr. Rita Makarskaitė-Petkevičienė (Vilnius University) moderated four presentations. Traditionally, on the second day of the conference, practical seminars were organized for all conference participants. A similar goal was set at this conference - to make all reports useful for all professionals at all levels of education. 
Most conference reports were presented in the form of articles and published in the conference proceedings. One can find full texts in the database at: https://oaji.net/journal-archive-stats.html?number=1984&year=2021&issue=18298 It is tentatively scheduled that the 28th Conference will take place on April 29-30, 2022, also remotely.

We summarized cohort studies investigating the association between the Mediterranean diet and risk of overweight and/or obesity and weight change in adults. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar was conducted up to May 2021. Prospective cohorts that examined the Mediterranean diet adherence in adults as the exposure, and overweight and/or obesity or weight change as the outcomes, and reported RRs or β coefficients and 95% CIs as the effect sizes were included. Seven prospective cohort studies were included of which 6 studies (with 244,678 adult participants) reported the risk of overweight and/or obesity, and 4 cohorts (with 436,617 participants) reported the weight change (3 cohorts reported both overweight and/or obesity risk and weight change). Combining 15 effect sizes from 6 cohorts revealed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with a 9% decreased risk of overweight and/or obesity (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.94; I2 = 44.7%; PQ-test = 0.031). This association was significant in the case of studies investigating combined overweight and obesity (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.96; I2 = 29.4%; PQ-test = 0.166), but not for studies that reported on obesity (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.43, 1.10, I2 = 50.6%, PQ-test = 0.132). Linear dose-response analysis of 6 studies showed a 2% decreased risk of overweight and/or obesity for 1 additional Mediterranean diet score (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96, 0.99). Each unit increase in the Mediterranean diet score was associated with 0.04 kg less weight gain over 5 y (-0.04 kg; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.02 kg; 13 effect sizes from 4 cohorts). In conclusion, Mediterranean diet adherence is inversely associated with risk of overweight and/or obesity as well as 5-y weight gain and thus has practical importance for public health.",Advances in Nutrition,2021.0,50,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmab092', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'publisher-specific-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/advances/nmab092?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmab092, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3979ac3deab0cbcbccb7479df81096513d1ea41b,English language teaching and learning during Covid-19: A global perspective on the first year,"The world recently witnessed the unexpected emergence of a coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic and severely impacted all aspects of human life. The sudden lockdown that came with the announcement of the pandemic affected health systems, the world economy and, inevitably, education systems across the globe. Due to the pandemic, schools and universities were closed, face-to-face education was suspended and a shift to emergency online teaching was instituted. English language training took its share in this transition and several studies were conducted to investigate the effects of the pandemic on emergency online teaching and the learning of English. This integrative literature review study analyses and synthesizes the research studies conducted between March 2020 and February 2021 to illustrate the first year of the pandemic in terms of English language teaching and learning globally. Thus, 69 research studies were selected for analysis. Findings show that the emergency online teaching and learning of English mainly created challenges due to the internet connection problems and students' access to computer or smart phones. On the other hand, contributing the teachers' digital literacy skills, the significance of online teaching and learning in case of emergency situations was highlighted as the findings showed. The studies produced conflicting results in terms of the implementation of emergency online teaching and learning practices, English language teachers and students' perceptions and attitudes, the affective, motivational and cognitive aspects, and the impact of emergency online teaching on the language development of students.",Journal of Educational Technology and Online Learning,2021.0,57,"{'url': 'https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/1677427', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31681/JETOL.907757?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31681/JETOL.907757, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

30f695899875339758471ea48d27ade41c6e636a,Work-focused Experiential Learning to Increase STEM Student Retention and Graduation at Two-year Hispanic-serving Institutions,"With support from the National Science Foundation's Division of Undergraduate Education, this five-year project led by a two-year Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) seeks to provide underrepresented students with mentored work experiences in computer information systems. Students will have access to paid on-campus work experiences and internships in businesses and industries. It is anticipated that some examples of potential student projects include mobile application development, cybersecurity, and computer support. It is expected that these experiences will increase undergraduate student interest, persistence, and success in computer information systems, as well as in STEM more broadly. To ensure that they are well-prepared for and gain the most from their work experiences, students will receive training on employability skills such as communication, teamwork, and project management. In addition, during their work experiences, students will be mentored by faculty, industry professionals, and peers. To strengthen the capacity of faculty to serve all students, including Hispanic students, the project will provide faculty with professional development focused on an equity mindset. This framework to provide mentored work experiences will be developed and piloted at Phoenix College, in the computer information technology department and eventually expanded to other STEM fields at the institution. Following this, the project also intends to expand this framework to four other two-year HSIs in the region. Through this work, the project aims to develop a replicable model for how two-year institutions can develop work experiences that foster increased student graduation and entry into STEM career pathways. This project, which is currently in its first year, seeks to examine how a curriculum that integrates cross-sector partnerships to provide work experiences can enhance STEM learning and retention. Using mixed methods and grounded theory, the project will expand knowledge about: (1) the impact of cross-sector partnerships that support work-focused experiential teaching and learning;(2) systematic ways to maintain and better use cross-sector partnerships;and (3) the degree to which a model of work-focused learning experiences can be adopted at other two-year HSIs and by other STEM fields. Baseline data about Hispanic serving identity at the pilot institution has been collected and assessed at the institutional, departmental, and for different educator roles including faculty, support staff, and administrative leaders to produce inputs towards developing a detailed plan of action. Early results from baseline data, visualizations, planning responses, and initial project activities for student work experiences and faculty professional development will be reported in the submission. The impact of Covid-19 to Year 1 activities will also be discussed. Expected long term results of the project include: development of sustainable mechanisms to foster cross-sector partnerships;increased student retention and workforce readiness;and measurable successes for STEM students, particularly Hispanic students, at two-year HSIs. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--38212?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--38212, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, the majority of medical research papers he has read thus far are primarily based on statistics. As a result, in this article, he selects some basic statistical tools, such as correlation, variance, p-values, and multiple regression analyses, to study the predicted body weight as the output (dependent variable) by using his foods quantity and sleep score as inputs (independent variables). Since 5/1/2015, the author has been collecting various data related to his food nutrition (~0.5 million data) and sleep conditions. The Food Details (FD) category includes both food quantity (m9a) and food quality (nutrition, m9b). Previously, he has researched and published a few articles regarding the relationship between body weight and quantity of food consumption. During 11/8/2020 - 11/10/2021, he experimented with intermittent fasting experiments to study their inter-connectivity. In this paper, he will combine sleep score (m7) with food quantity (m9a) and connected them with his body weight in early morning (m1) using the multiple regression analysis method. In this study, he will not repeat the detailed introduction of the regression analysis in the Method section because it is available in many statistics textbook. It should be noted that in regression analysis, the correlation coefficient R should be > 0.5 or 50% to indicate a strong inter-connectivity and the p-value should be <0.05 to be considered as statistically significant.",Journal of Applied Material Science &amp; Engineering Research,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33140/jamser.05.04.13?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33140/jamser.05.04.13, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The 2020 statistics released in 2021 showed that about 37.6 million people globally are living with HIV; 1.5 million people became newly infected in 2020 and 690,000 people died from AIDS related cases the same year. A literature search revealed that more than 1.6 million Nigerians have died of HIV/AIDS since the outbreak of the epidemic in 1985 while millions of Nigerians are living with HIV as of today. Certain factors have contributed to this alarming statistic. One of such is the unwillingness by most persons to undertake an HIV test due to the fear of stigmatization. A simple system that can be of help in evaluating a person’s risk of contracting HIV without stigmatization is developed in this work. The system takes into account some behavioural factors, signs and symptoms that suggest a person may be at risk of having or be prone to HIV and thus makes a prediction of the risk status based on the input supplied. A simple framework was developed with input from medical practitioners based on their wealth of experience. The input was used to derive twenty two (22) questions centered on behavioural factors, signs and symptoms which were designed to be answered by the users during interaction with the system. A simple evaluation takes place using the user’s inputs and a predefined set of rules to classify the risk value as one of (Very High, High, Moderate, Low and Not at Risk) with appropriate advice. The system was implemented in Visual Studio Environment using Visual Basic.Net. It is expected that after using the system, users will be encouraged to go for tests where it is recommended.

In addition to text-based functions, the designed chatbot includes a video accessed on the web to support students visually and aurally. The chatbot was designed using the Dialogflow program and an instant messaging program made available to students through a group created on Telegram. The study, which used a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design, included 41 participants (n = 20 for the experimental, n = 21 for the control group) studying in the 5th grade of a state secondary school in the 2020-2021 academic year. Results suggest that although there was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of academic achievement, it was determined that the chatbot application positively affected the online learning experience of the experimental group students. Students’ opinions about the chatbot included that it was useful and fun, they would like to use it for other courses, it provided useful assistance in learning outside the classroom, and it allowed them to repeat the course again.

The GAPS program seeks to incorporate project management skill training from industry into STEM graduate students’ thesis research. In Fall 2020, as part of the program, a semester-long course titled Introduction of Project Management for Thesis Research was developed. A total of 19 students were enrolled in this class in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. We utilized a pragmatic evaluation paradigm to develop assessment tools and collect data regarding the program’s effectiveness. We have collected a variety of data from the first two GAPS cohorts that include program participation data, document analysis, and student surveys. In this paper, we highlight the results of our assessment, which demonstrate the potential of this approach to improve graduate training and will be leveraged to improve training for future cohorts.

The title of the symposium was “Scientometry, Citation, Plagiarism and Predatory in Scientific Publishing”. Experiences in the scientific area covered by title of this conference were presented by some of the most influential scientists from Bosnia and Herzegovina, who are included between 2% of authors in the Stanford scientometric list, which was published in October 2021 in the journal Biology Plos. Some of the authors are former or current Editors-in-Chiefs of indexed biomedical journals in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia (Izet Masic, Asim Kurjak, Doncho Donev, Osman Sinanovic). Also, Sylwia Ufnalska and Izet Masic are or were members of the European Association of Science Editors (EASE) and they have great experiences about the topic of this conference. Science that analyzes scientific papers and their citation in the scientific journals – called scientometrics – day by day has become important for measuring scientific validity and quality of all kinds of publications deposited in the most important on-line scientific databases, like WoS, Scopus, Medline, PubMed Central, Embase, Hinari, etc., but also in academic platforms ResearchGate and Academia.edu. Scientometrics use the Impact and Echo factor for measuring the quality of publications in WoS journals, Scopus uses the h-Index, and the most common one used in the last 10 years is Google Scholar index. All of them have advantages and disadvantages, and also positive and negative influences in the academic praxis. One of the greatest, and sadly too common, problems which participants in the academic process encountered are plagiarism and predatory publishing. In order to prevent this severest form of academic fraud, authors must give credit to someone whose work has helped him/her by citing references correctly. This presentations of the symposium ""SWEP 2021"") analyzed the major components of scientometrics, the basic mechanisms of citations in medical publications and plagiarism, as an opposition to the primary goal of scientific enterprise: search for truth.",Medical archives,2021.0,10,"{'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8802683', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8802683, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The value of the JCI is the mean Category Normalized Citation Impact (CNCI) for all articles and reviews published in a journal in the preceding 3 years” [1]. The main difference between the JCI and the Journal Impact Factor ( JIF) is that the denominator of the JCI is the number of reviews and articles for only the most recent 3 years, while the numerator is the citations of those reviews and articles for 4 years, including the current year. A JCI value of 1.0 corresponds to the mean value of each category of journals in the Web of Science Core Collection. A JCI value of 2 indicates that the citation impact of a journal in the corresponding category is 2 times the mean value., whereas a JCI value of 0.5 means that a journal’s impact is half of the mean value in the corresponding category.",Journal of Educational Evaluation for Health Professions,2021.0,9,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3352/jeehp.2021.18.20', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8411047, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Aim and objectives: Tostudy the correlation of dental caries and malocclusion with hormonal fingerprints. 
Materialsand Methods: A total of 100 children of age group 7-15 years and both genders were randomlyselected and included in the present study. The hormonal fingerprint (2D:4D ratio) wasdone bymeasuring the length ratio of the index and ring finger with the help of digital vernier caliper.Caries assessment wascarried out using standard mouth mirrors and Community PeriodontalIndex probes. WHO assessment form (1997) was followed for assessment of dentitionstatus and treatment need.Occlusal characteristics evaluated were molar relation, anteriorand posterior crossbite, open bite, deep bite and lower anterior crowding. The subjects weredivided into high 2D:4D, equal 2D:4D digit ratio and low 2D:4D. All the measurements weredone by two investigators. The data collected were tabulated and statistically analyzed usingChi-square and ANOVA test. 
Results: Out of 100 children, 34% were males and 66% werefemales. Most of the participants were 7-8 years old (12 males and 15 females). Majority of theparticipants (87% for the right hand and 80% for left hand) had low 2D:4D ratio, only 6% forright and 11% for the left hand had high 2D:4D ratio and the remaining had equal 2D:4D ratio.Statistically insignificantcorrelation between 2D:4D ratio and deft/DMFT score and occlusalstatus of an individualwere found. 
Conclusion:The insignificant results of 2D:4D ratio with allthe parameters assessed validates that hormonal fingerprints could not be employed as an earlypredictor of caries and malocclusion in an individual.

In total, about 75% of all the largest objects ever launched have already returned. Two current examples of large objects returned to the atmosphere are those of the Tiangong-1 Space Lab (April 2, 2018) and heavy-lift launch vehicle Long March 5B (May 9, 2021). The threat posed by space debris has become a global issue, and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is a prerequisite for any space activity. Optical systems provide valuable assistance in identifying and monitoring such objects. The Space Systems and Space Surveillance Laboratory of University of Rome “La Sapienza” (S5Lab) carries out activities for space surveillance purposes and develop algorithms and software for analysing the data collected by optical systems. This article focuses on determining the attitude of space debris from their optical observation. For this purpose, a simulator of the space environment and a genetic algorithm were used through which it is possible to derive the presumed attitude parameters (Euler angles and angular velocities) that the object had at the time of acquisition.","2021 3rd International Congress on Human-Computer Interaction, Optimization and Robotic Applications (HORA)",2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/HORA52670.2021.9461386?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/HORA52670.2021.9461386, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f2ff46f13f6707be0295e1d6f6d00df9f3d4ce86,Ethics and Creativity in Computer Vision,"This paper offers a retrospective of what we learnt from organizing the workshop Ethical Considerations in Creative applications of Computer Vision at CVPR 2021 conference and, prior to that, a series of workshops on Computer Vision for Fashion, Art and Design at ECCV 2018, ICCV 2019, and CVPR 2020. We hope this reflection will bring artists and machine learning researchers into conversation around the ethical and social dimensions of creative applications of computer vision. 1 CVFAD: Computer Vision for Fashion, Art and Design In 2018, we organized, in conjuction with ECCV, the first workshop on Computer Vision for Fashion, Art and Design. The workshop concentrated on generating, analyzing and processing visual content and invited the computer vision community to use generative model as a tool. As part of this workshop, we organized the Fashion-Gen [4] challenge for language to visual fashion design. The workshop also included a Computer Vision Art Gallery, organized by Luba Elliot and Xavier Snelgrove, to reflect the growing community of digital artists. Overall, the workshop brought together researchers in computer vision, artists and professionals from creative domains to discuss open problems in the areas of computer vision for fashion and creative visual content generation. Our ICCV 2019 and CVPR 2020 workshops broadened the scope of focus to include economical and industrial applications of creative computer vision tools. We hosted two fashion oriented challenges, FashionIQ [8] on multimodal fashion image retrieval [8] by Wu et al and DeepFashion2 [1] on a variety of fashion and clothing tasks such as fashion landmark detection by Ge et al. In ICCV 2019, Adriana Kovashka [7] brought up discussions on biases in creative advertisement content creation, and in political campaigns. We also had discussions during the panel discussions on potential harms that can be created by lack of representation in fashion industry and datasets. 2 EC3V: Ethical Considerations in Creative Applications of Computer Vision In 2021, we organized, in conjunction with CVPR, the first workshop on Ethical Considerations in Creative applications of Computer Vision (E3CV) . This workshop built upon 3 years of prior workshop organizing experience — 4 creativity-oriented challenges, as well as a successful Creativity in AI workshop series at NeurIPS and multiple generative art symposiums at the intersection of machine learning research and fashion industry — and oriented our focus around the under-explored ethical dimensions of creative computer vision work. With this workshop, we brought together a team of computer vision researchers, artists, and sociotechnical researchers to address growing number of questions on broader impact of this research. At a high level, the workshop focused on (a) the recognition of creative computer vision technologies as a new form of art , (b) influence of these technologies on society and representations [2] and (c) the areas that requires greater attention and discussion, and can create potential harms [3, 5]. 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021), Sydney, Australia. We also hosted the Computer Vision Art Gallery this year to bring more artists as one of the major stakeholders to the discussion. The computer vision art gallery showcased the work of 60+ artists addressing a range of topics and leveraging range of computer vision methods. For example, Jake Elwes’s work ‘Zizi and Me’ 11 showcased a double act between drag queen Me and a deep fake clone of Me. In doing so, the work aims to both demystify AI and queer the process of AI development. Nouf Aljowaysir’s project, ‘Salaf’, leveraged generative techniques to make visible the patterns of inclusion and exclusion operative in AI systems and express her personal frustrations with the Western colonial gaze so frequently embedded within the systems in use today. Many fruitful conversations came out of the workshop including the oral presentation 14 by Prabhu and Isiain [3] critiquing our implementation of art gallery and submission process. Two main anchors that covered major conversations during our breakout sessions were around cultural appropriation, and ownership as well as issues integrated in training data. Cultural appropriation vs inspiration Algorithmic techniques offer new routes for adopting and transferring aesthetic styles in ways that can be beautiful and creative and even shed light on cultures and art that individuals might not otherwise engage with. However, these same tools risk enabling new forms of cultural appropriation as they can make it even easier to extract from marginalized cultures without any accompanying investment in that culture, understanding of the significance of the artefact or aesthetics, or meaningful engagement with or say from the community. Cultural appropriation [2], distributed art and eventually generative art, all raise once again the question of intellectual property. If a traditional African pattern is re-contextualised in western fashion, is it fair to share the profit? If an artwork is the result of millions of people interacting with a website, should everyone get a fraction of the credit? The question becomes more complex when considering techniques based on deep learning, where a model is trained by exposure to thousands of images. These models can later be deployed by artists as aid to the creative process. How much credit goes to the ideator of the algorithm in this case? And how much to the creators of the content that was used to create the content? While ethical considerations for what concerns the work of a specific artist are starting to be discussed in depth, the aspect of broader cultural appropriation is still relatively unexplored. Fundamental challenges arise when trying to define ownership and copyrights in the context of Traditional Cultural Expression, where the intellectual contribution can’t be attributed to a single individual, but results from, and often defines, the cultural evolution of specific groups of people. Generative art, training data: a source of inspiration or memorization? The ever-increasing ability of AI models to generate very realistic images introduces new challenges. AI-generated content can be carefully tailored to specific generations, creating (supposedly) new content that resembles the training data. Considerations related to the training data are: biases inherently present in the data, memorization of training data, and insufficient transparency around some dataset creation processes [5]. When using models trained on specific datasets to generate art, any bias present in the training data is unavoidably learned by the model and revealed in its generations [6]. Many contemporary artists have begun to engage with ML researchers to find these biases. Some have done this for the visual aesthetics that the techniques begin to allow, others engage with them more critically in order to understand and reveal the algorithmic processes that are beginning to have great social and political power. These groups often notice the social dimension of the algorithms which can be overlooked by the computer science community.",arXiv.org,2021.0,19,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03111, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1067ad39d6674847984c18b7147cd42d0b89fd21,How can behavioural science help us design better trials?,"Background Clinical trials remain the cornerstone of evidence-based health care. As of July 1, 2021, there were 382,313 clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, an average of 33,400 new registrations over each of the past 3 years, and 19,782 new registrations for this year (2021) alone [1]. Even assuming modest sample sizes of 125 participants for each of those new 19,782 trials in that one registry, these trials already require more than 2.4 million participants this year, approximately 13,737 every day, and hundreds of potential participants being approached or being followed up right now. Despite the incredible volume of research activity and collective trial experience, trials still routinely take longer (and cost more) than originally proposed, often due to challenges with recruitment (including participants in a trial) and/or retention (keeping participants in a trial) [2]. For example, only 56% of UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment funded trials recruited the number of people they needed, and some suffered loss to follow-up of up to 77% [2]. Alongside challenges of recruitment and retention, many other trial process-related deficiencies produce trial results that are at best unreliable and at worst unusable leading to research waste [3]. Amongst the existing evidence on how to improve the design and conduct of trials, little attention has been given to the integral and multifactorial role of human behaviour to trial success. Indeed, all of these trials depend on behaviours: they rely on people (patients, clinicians, trial staff) performing actions (such as receiving or delivering a trial intervention, attending a clinic, returning a questionnaire, or approaching eligible participants) that they would not do otherwise. Clearly defining and specifying behaviours is a key first step in clarifying behaviours in terms of who needs to do what differently to/for whom and when. The AACTT behaviour specification framework was developed for implementation research and proposes five domains (action, actor, context, target, time) to describe and detail relevant behaviours [4]. The AACTT framework can be used to specify the behaviours of individuals and to describe team and organisational behaviour. Even considering a simple process such as developing AACTT specifications for key trial activities (e.g. returning a questionnaire) could provide considerable additional insight. There are many influences on participants, trial staff, and clinicians’ behaviours within clinical trials. These trial-related behaviours are widespread, often contextually dependent and amenable to change. Indeed, failure to recognise the behavioural influences (and change them where appropriate) could contribute to the failure of the trial. Moreover, insofar as behaviours are at the heart of clinical trial delivery, then behavioural science—the study of behaviour and behaviour change—can provide critical, replicable, and generalisable insights for the clinical trials community.",Trials,2021.0,20,"{'url': 'https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13063-021-05853-x', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8643190, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This research is a type of experimental research that uses the Pretest Posttest Control Group Design model. The subjects of this study were students in the Integrated Science Education study program for the academic year 2020/2021 of Universitas Negeri Semarang. The sample from the population was divided into experimental class and control class. The observation instrument used an observation sheet based on the assessment indicators of students' activities during learning. Data analysis in this study used quantitative descriptive analysis, where each average value is described in each aspect of the assessment based on indicators. The results showed that the experimental class that applied the Real Science Mask with QR Code had the highest average score of Problem-Solving skills in the assessment aspect of discussing the suitability of scientific phenomena with a score of 9.4 and scientific literacy on the aspect of student assessment in seeking scientific references with a score of 8.8. The posttest results obtained a t-count value of 8,951 with df = 16, consulted with the t-table value at a significance level of 5%, and df = 16 obtained 2,120. These results indicate that the value of t-count is greater than the t-table value (8,951 > 2,120) it means that there is a significant difference between the experimental and control classes. Furthermore, the average of these two aspects of the assessment is higher when compared to the control class.

fb33932819af4929dc972aa57a4d6c4a4678c4ee,Asynchronous Learning: Its Effects on Academic Performance and Students’ Motivation In Science,"The main purpose of the study is to determine the effect of asynchronous learning to academic performance and students’ motivation towards Science. It is necessary since motivation serves as a foundation for better understanding of science concepts in an asynchronous setting. The respondents are 201 grade 11 students of Iligan Computer Institute (ICI) who are enrolled during the Academic Year 2020-2021. The ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) model was used in the study for the development of asynchronous lesson on Genetic Engineering with Google Classroom as the online platform. The research utilized SMTSL (Students Motivation Towards Science Learning) questionnaire developed by Tuan, et al. (2005) composed of 35 questions encompassing six (6) domains of motivation namely, self-efficacy, active learning strategies, science learning value, performance goal, achievement goal and learning environment stimulation. Quantitative data together with qualitative analysis showed that students are moderately motivated towards science learning in an asynchronous environment. The highest identified domain is science learning value indicating that students find the relevance of science with daily life which makes them motivated to learn science even in a remote learning environment where there is no direct contact and supervision. In contrast, self-efficacy and performance goal are the least domains suggesting that students are least concerned with their own ability to perform well in science learning tasks and they do not compete with other students and get attention from the teacher. Using the researcher-made achievement test and performance task to measure their academic performance, 80% of the students belong to approaching proficiency, proficient and advanced groups showing that students did well in science in an asynchronous learning environment.  Moreover, students’ motivation was significantly correlated with science academic performance so science academic performance can be used as indirect evidence of students’ motivation. Based on these findings, it is recommended that curriculum experts and educators consider factors of motivation in revisiting the science curriculum in an asynchronous environment.",THABIEA : JOURNAL OF NATURAL SCIENCE TEACHING,2021.0,10,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.21043/thabiea.v4i1.9806', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21043/THABIEA.V4I1.9806?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21043/THABIEA.V4I1.9806, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To assess the relationship of individual article citations in the Sport Sciences field to (i) journal impact factor; (ii) each article's open access status; and (iii) Altmetric score components.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional.


METHODS
We searched the ISI Web of Knowledge InCites Journal Citation Reports database ""Sport Sciences"" category for the 20 journals with the highest 2-year impact factor in 2018. We extracted the impact factor for each journal and each article's open access status (yes or no). Between September 2019 and February 2020, we obtained individual citations, Altmetric scores and details of Altmetric components (e.g. number of tweets, Facebook posts, etc.) for each article published in 2017. Linear and multiple regression models were used to assess the relationship between the dependent variable (citation number) and the independent variables article Altmetric score and open access status, and journal impact factor.


RESULTS
4,022 articles were included. Total Altmetric score, journal impact factor and open access status, respectively explained 32%, 14%, and 1% of the variance in article citations (when combined, the variables explained 40% of the variance in article citations). The number of tweets related to an article was the Altmetric component that explained the highest proportion of article citations (37%).


CONCLUSION
Altmetric scores in Sports Sciences journals have a stronger relationship with number of citations than does journal impact factor or open access status. Twitter may be the best social media platform to promote a research article as it has a strong relationship with article citations.

1771c526e1bb3c5827f406dad24df89fb07efea4,"Covid-19, pandemic risk and inequality: emerging social science insights at 24 months","In this editorial, we introduce a special thematic collection of articles published in this current issue, and earlier in 2021, which develop a range of social science approaches to studying and theorising pandemic risk, largely focused on the COVID-19 pandemic. We structure this editorial essay in two parts. First, we consider the challenges of theorising pandemics with an attentiveness to inequality. We consider what different theoretical approaches have brought and can bring to studying risk and inequality, before developing a more in-depth consideration of the work of Mary Douglas for this purpose. We draw out key features of Douglas’s work on ‘centre and periphery’, alongside the related group dynamics and tensions which are configured by, and help reproduce, social inequalities. Second, we then develop a dialogue between these analytical sensibilities around inequality, drawn from Douglas, and various conceptualisations and findings emerging in the eight studies published on pandemics in Health, Risk and Society this year (4 in this issue, 4 appearing earlier in the year). Douglas’s work, which has often been neglected in studies of inequalities and risk, provides valuable insights into institutional dynamics of culture and power. The eight recent studies in the journal include some conducted in contexts, and by researchers, located towards the global economic and academic periphery. This diversification, beyond the usual social and governmental contexts, and alongside the growing involvement of different epistemic communities, introduces and cultivates valuable insights, for the field of risk, inequality and health more generally, and for grasping the global phenomena of the pandemic.","Health, Risk and Society",2021.0,12,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/13698575.2021.2016288?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/13698575.2021.2016288, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In the experimental group (n = 60), the course was taught with web 2.0 supported materials; in the control group (n = 60), instruction was made by adhering to the activities in the textbook. The research was carried out by making use of mixed method research. A quantitative quasi-experimental model with pretest and posttest control groups was used. In the qualitative dimension, opinions were obtained from the students after the application. In the study, semi-structured interview form and academic achievement test prepared for the unit of the world of living things were used as data collection tools. While the data obtained from the students to the achievement test before and after the application was transferred to a statistical package program and analyzed; the data obtained from the interview form were analyzed using content analysis. When the posttest academic achievement score data obtained from the students were compared as a result of the study, it was found that there was a significant difference in favor of the experimental group. In addition, results from the interviews, revealed that students found science teaching with web-supported materials fun and enjoyable and that they wanted these to be used in science lessons. As a result of this study, it is recommended that web 2.0 tools be used by educators in science education.",Science Education International,2021.0,4,"{'url': 'http://www.icaseonline.net/journal/index.php/sei/article/download/331/282', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33828/sei.v32.i4.6?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33828/sei.v32.i4.6, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Reuse permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ. INTRODUCTION The emergence of SARSCoV-2 in the end of 2019, an aetiologic agent responsible for the SARS plunged the world into an unprecedented sanitary crisis. Papers on COVID-19 have been fasttracked since then. Accelerated time from submission to publication and qualitative changes in peer review, associated with empirical evidence that duplicate and implausible clinical trials have been carried out during the pandemic, could perhaps imply lower quality of peer review in COVID-19 research. Accumulating empirical evidence has also been indicating the pandemic era output to be less reliable than its prepandemic counterpart. 10–14 A systematic review to evaluate the methodological quality of COVID-19 peerreviewed clinical studies compared with historical controls found methodological quality scores to be lower in COVID-19 articles across all study designs. Meanwhile, data sharing practices remained largely unchanged during the first year of the pandemic. 14 With no mandates of data sharing in place for COVID-19 studies, the reproducibility of these data on COVID-19 is yet to be independently verified as well. However, more efficiency in scientific publication did manifest in accelerated publication, journals tearing down their paywalls for their COVID-19 output, an increased usage of life and medical sciences preprint servers to increase speed and transparency, not to mention the intense international collaboration that resulted in the development of multiple highefficacy vaccines within the first year of the pandemic. On the other hand, some pratices that reduce the reliability of clinical trials may have gained some traction during 2020, such as executing underpowered studies with small samples, multiplicity of trials testing ideas with low prior probability of being true, forgoing blinding to test interventions 11 14 17–20 and incomplete reporting of findings, which was already an issue before the pandemic. 21 To what extent that has dominated the general output in medical interventions for COVID-19 and how much of it turned into actual clinical pratice is something that has not yet been thoroughly assessed and is, thus, still open for debate. 14 Notwithstanding, it is likely that poor science, even if it being the exception within an overall output, when carelessly amplified within a context of sanitary crisis and political polarisation, may be consequential, as it has been the case of the now infamous hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) study, that strengthened a trend in nonevidencebased interventions for COVID-19 and divided the Brazilian medical community to this date. 24 The mechanism of how that type of misinformation plays out in the current media environment is the topic of interest of this brief communication as disseminating scientific findings through press releases and press conferences but without timely access to the study nor to its data has also gained some traction in 2020 in Brazil. 14 25 Below, we briefly discuss how a small set of exceptionally poorly designed studies disseminated through the press, weeks or months before publication and without access to the data sets used to generate these studies for a more thorough assessment, played into a cycle of misinformation in Brazil in the first year of the pandemic. And, to conclude, we suggest a programme of scientific investigation aimed to properly examine and address coright.",BMJ Open Science,2021.0,4,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjos-2021-100202', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8647590, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Bibliometrics could assist scholars to analyze the development of pharmacovigilance. Methods: The MeSH terms of both pharmacovigilance and “adverse drug reaction reporting system” were retrieved in the Science Citation Index Expanded. The articles from 1974 to July 2021 in the pharmacology and pharmacy category were recruited. The citation reports including the publication numbers, h-index, and sum and average cited times in terms of annuals, countries, organizations, authors and journals were tabulated. The coauthorship relations in the analysis units of countries, organizations, and authors; the top 10 burst references; the document citation network; and the author’s keywords co-occurrence overlay map were visualized by bibliometric software including the website (https://bibliometric.com/), VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and CitNetExplorer. Results: From 1974 to the present, the most high-yield publication year, country, institute, author, and journal were 2020 (n = 222), France (n = 522), Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb (n = 82), Jean–Louis Montastruc (n = 125), Drug Safety (n = 384), respectively, in all 2,128 articles. Similarly, the United States, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, and Jean–Louis Montastruc had the most coauthorship strength at the macrolevel (global), mesolevel (local), and microlevel (individual). The topics of burst references covered are the development of methodology, issues of patients reporting and under-reporting, evaluation of methods and databases, assessment of causality, and perspectives in pharmacovigilance. Eight clusters were grouped in the document citation network. “Pharmacovigilance,” “adverse drug reactions,” “pharmacoepidemiology,” “drug safety,” and “signal detection” were the research priorities, while “drug-related side effects and adverse reactions,” “VigiBase,” “disproportionality analysis,” “social media,” “FAERS,” “chemotherapy,” “patient safety,” “reporting odds ratio,” and “preventability” might be the future research hotspots. Conclusion: Positive synergies can be observed in this study by employing the multiple software tools which established the relationship between the units of analysis.

BACKGROUND: In an effort to mitigate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), North Carolina closed prekindergarten through grade 12 public schools to in-person instruction on March 14, 2020. On July 15, 2020, North Carolina’s governor announced schools could open via remote learning or a hybrid model that combined in-person and remote instruction. In August 2020, 56 of 115 North Carolina school districts joined The ABC Science Collaborative (ABCs) to implement public health measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and share lessons learned. We describe secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within participating school districts during the first 9 weeks of in-person instruction in the 2020–2021 academic year. METHODS: From August 15, 2020 to October 23, 2020, 11 of 56 school districts participating in ABCs were open for in-person instruction for all 9 weeks of the first quarter and agreed to track incidence and secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Local health department staff adjudicated secondary transmission. Superintendents met weekly with ABCs faculty to share lessons learned and develop prevention methods. RESULTS: Over 9 weeks, 11 participating school districts had >90 000 students and staff attend school in person. Among these students and staff, 773 community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections were documented by molecular testing. Through contact tracing, health department staff determined an additional 32 infections were acquired within schools. No instances of child-to-adult transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were reported within schools.

Children and adolescents have been considered to play an important role in transmission regardless of presence of symptoms. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in children ages 5-to-19 years in a sample from the State of Texas in the presence and absence of symptoms. 
 
Methods: The TX CARES (Texas Coronavirus Antibody Response Survey) is an ongoing prospective population-based sample from the Texas general population (~29·8 million) that commenced in October 2020. For the current analysis, volunteers ages 5-to-19 years were recruited throughout the state from large pediatric healthcare systems, Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers, urban and rural pediatric and family medicine practices, health insurance providers, and a social media campaign. SARS-CoV-2 antibody status measured via the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassay. Prevalence of IgM, IgA, or IgG antibodies were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification of age and sex. We report here findings from January 1-June 1, 2021. 
 
Findings: This analysis that included 503 children ages 5-to-19 years showed 38·7% (95% CI, 34·5-43·1) of the sample was SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive in fully adjusted estimates. A total of 30·1% (95% CI, 29·4-31·5) of adults (N=6992) in the sample were antibody positive. Over half (55·8%) of those with positive antibody status were reportedly asymptomatic. Headache (25·4%), congestion/runny nose (20·8%), and fatigue (20·3%) and were the most frequently reported symptoms among those with a positive antibody result. The odds of having a positive antibody status was 37% higher in 15-to-19 year olds versus adults (OR 1·37, 95% CI, 1·03-1·83). 
 
Interpretation: These results highlight that a majority of the pediatric population remains immunologically naive to SARS-CoV-2, emphasizing the important role vaccines may play in reaching whole population herd immunity.

The increasing climate chaos of the Anthropocene additionally underscores the necessity of resilient societies and individuals. Individuals able to problem-solve in emergent situations are integral to a resilient society, and science education can develop these competencies both individually and collectively. We use the concept of resiliency to argue for science education that enables learners to adapt and respond in the face of disruption, unrest, and disaster. We focus specifically on the ways in which learning how to grow plants indoors can develop resilience on multiple levels while authentically facilitating science and engineering principles. This study seeks to explore how indoor agriculture might support science education for resiliency. We examine a higher-education project, the “Grow Pod,” involving shipping container agriculture with first-year undergraduates. We argue that inclusion of indoor agriculture within science education has the potential to support both learning for and as resiliency. In our analysis, we note how the Grow Pod project supports a science education for resiliency through collective learning that helps learners understand plant basics and how to grow food, and a science education as resiliency which includes learning through and rebounding from challenges/mistakes, learning resourcefulness, and experiencing restorative benefits of working with plants. © 2021 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.",Journal of Research in Science Teaching,2021.0,6,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/tea.21724?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/tea.21724, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The global burden of CKD is increasing, and is projected to become the 5th most common cause of years of life lost globally by 2040. CKD is a major cause of catastrophic health expenditure. The costs of dialysis and transplantation consume 2–3% of the annual healthcare budget in high-income countries. Crucially, kidney disease can be prevented and progression to end-stage kidney disease can be delayed with appropriate access to basic diagnostics and early treatment. This year World Kidney Day continues to raise awareness of the increasing burden of kidney diseases worldwide and to strive for kidney health for everyone, everywhere. During the pandemic with COVID 19 patients kidneys are also damaged, apart from the respiratory tract and other organs. It can lead to an increase in acute renal failure and consequent chronic kidney insufficiency, as well as number of deaths. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the renal function in each patient with COVID 19 virus. In the Republic of North Macedonia from 2006 to present day nephrologists and other medical personnel devoted to the early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of renal disease have participated in the activities of the World Kidney Day. These activities were supported by the Macedonian Society of Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation and Artificial Organs, the Department of Nephrology at the Medical Faculty, the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia, non-governmental nephrology organizations (NEFRON) and the media. There were lectures and presentation devoted to the various theme of the WKD, publications in journals, as well as activities for examination of the renal function of patients in the medical centers. The activities during the WKD contributed to the improvement of the nephrological protection of the citizens of the Republic of N. Macedonia.",PRILOZI,2021.0,7,"{'url': 'https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/prilozi-2021-0002', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2478/prilozi-2021-0002?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2478/prilozi-2021-0002, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

56a0dbed37176ef2b7e489a73fbe63fb437bf6d7,"A Systematic Review on AI-based Proctoring Systems: Past, Present and Future","There have been giant leaps in the field of education in the past 1–2 years.. Schools and colleges are transitioning online to provide more resources to their students. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided students more opportunities to learn and improve themselves at their own pace. Online proctoring services (part of assessment) are also on the rise, and AI-based proctoring systems (henceforth called as AIPS) have taken the market by storm. Online proctoring systems (henceforth called as OPS), in general, makes use of online tools to maintain the sanctity of the examination. While most of this software uses various modules, the sensitive information they collect raises concerns among the student community. There are various psychological, cultural and technological parameters need to be considered while developing AIPS. This paper systematically reviews existing AI and non-AI-based proctoring systems. Through the systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science and ERIC repositories, 43 paper were listed out from the year 2015 to 2021. We addressed 4 primary research questions which were focusing on existing architecture of AIPS, Parameters to be considered for AIPS, trends and Issues in AIPS and Future of AIPS. Our 360-degree analysis on OPS and AIPS reveals that security issues associated with AIPS are multiplying and are a cause of legitimate concern. Major issues include Security and Privacy concerns, ethical concerns, Trust in AI-based technology, lack of training among usage of technology, cost and many more. It is difficult to know whether the benefits of these Online Proctoring technologies outweigh their risks. The most reasonable conclusion we can reach in the present is that the ethical justification of these technologies and their various capabilities requires us to rigorously ensure that a balance is struck between the concerns with the possible benefits to the best of our abilities. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such analysis on AIPS and OPS. Our work further addresses the issues in AIPS in human and technological aspect. It also lists out key points and new technologies that have only recently been introduced but could significantly impact online education and OPS in the years to come.",Education and Information Technologies : Official Journal of the IFIP technical committee on Education,2021.0,125,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10639-021-10597-x.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8220875, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Several reasons can be considered: people are in close contact with each other, i.e., at a short range (1 m), and the healthcare system is not sufficiently developed or does not have enough facilities to manage and fight the pandemic, even in developed countries such as the USA and the U.K. and countries in Europe. There is a great need in healthcare for remote monitoring of COVID-19 symptoms. In the past year, a number of IoT-based devices and wearables have been introduced by researchers, providing good results in terms of high accuracy in diagnosing patients in the prodromal phase and in monitoring the symptoms of patients, i.e., respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature, etc. In this systematic review, we analyzed these wearables and their need in the healthcare system. The research was conducted using three databases: IEEE Xplore®, Web of Science®, and PubMed Central®, between December 2019 and June 2021. This article was based on the PRISMA guidelines. Initially, 1100 articles were identified while searching the scientific literature regarding this topic. After screening, ultimately, 70 articles were fully evaluated and included in this review. These articles were divided into two categories. The first one belongs to the on-body sensors (wearables), their types and positions, and the use of AI technology with ehealth wearables in different scenarios from screening to contact tracing. In the second category, we discuss the problems and solutions with respect to utilizing these wearables globally.

This meta-analysis and systematic review compared the prevalence of the whole range of suicidality comprising suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plan (SP), suicide attempt (SA), and completed suicide (CS), between patients with MDD and non-MDD controls. Methods: Major international (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE) and Chinese (Chinese Nation Knowledge Infrastructure and WANFANG) databases were systematically and independently searched from their inception until January 12, 2021. Results: Fifteen studies covering 85,768 patients (12,668 in the MDD group and 73,100 in the non-MDD group) were included in the analyses. Compared to non-MDD controls, the odds ratios (ORs) for lifetime, past month, past year, and 2-week prevalence of SI in MDD were 2.88 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.30–27.22, p = 0.36], 49.88 (95% CI = 2–8.63, p < 0.001), 13.97 (95% CI = 12.67–15.41, p < 0.001), and 24.81 (95% CI = 15.70–39.22, p < 0.001), respectively. Compared to non-MDD controls, the OR for lifetime SP in MDD was 9.51 (95% CI = 7.62–11.88, p < 0.001). Compared to non-MDD controls, the ORs of lifetime and past-year prevalence of SA were 3.45 (95% CI = 1.58–7.52, p = 0.002), and 7.34 (95% CI = 2.14–25.16, p = 0.002), respectively, in MDD patients. No difference in the prevalence of CS between MDD and controls was found (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.23–2.02, p = 0.50). Conclusions: MDD patients are at a higher risk of suicidality, compared to non-MDD controls. Routine screening for a range of suicidality should be included in the management of MDD, followed by timely treatment for suicidal patients.

b820e9efaf20ede51fafebe1beb8fd1e41fe6af9,Teaching Materials Science Labs Online Asynchronously,"After an eight year hiatus, I was asked suddenly to teach eight sections, each consisting of twelve students, of the Materials Science Lab course (306) in fall 2020 following the COVID-19 pandemic. During the past eight years, my instructional materials for 306 had been adopted by other instructors who left online quizzes and online surveys unchanged, and made modest changes to my presentation slides, and lab report templates and formats. In fall 2020, faculty at my university chose their own modality of instruction - in-person, online or a hybrid mode. I chose asynchronous instead of synchronous because of issues related to the large number of lab sections, and the unpredictability of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In spring 2021, I am teaching ten sections of this lab course. I have made significant improvements to my instructional materials from the fall semester that are included in this paper. I wanted to give my students a lab experience that would be equal to or better than the traditional in-person experience prior to the pandemic. In most traditional in-person experiments, students measure physical dimensions such as thickness, width and diameter at various length scales using instruments such as an ordinary ruler, a Vernier caliper, or a micrometer. To implement similar measurements online, I decided to integrate image analysis using FijI based on ImageJ software, and use it as a video caliper tool to measure features in ordinary and high resolution images. Traditionally, 306 and courses similar to it at other universities focus almost exclusively on experimental techniques to measure properties and characterize materials. In restructuring the course, I decided to add comparable emphasis on structure and processing of materials as it relates to testing and characterization of metallic materials. This paper describes the first three of the seven experiments that were developed focusing on: (1) Introductory Image Analysis and Brinell hardness testing, (2) Strengthening mechanisms and tensile testing, and (3) Cold working and Rockwell hardness testing. In each experiment, students are instructed in theory, principles, and methods using a YouTube video of narrated slides and board work, and laboratory demonstration. They are given images and data from the experiment, and data and report templates. Students make their own measurements using FijI, perform data analysis using Excel, and submit a concise lab report with critical evaluation of results and summary conclusions. The paper includes the course schedule listing the topics for each lab, grading policy, objectives for the first lab, and supporting instructional elements including the lab report grading rubric, and sample quiz questions. It also includes the survey collected after each lab, and response statistics from the first lab. Actions taken in response to the student feedback are also included. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37815?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37815, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This research aimed to design science learning domains for a 2e (gifted and blind) student to enhance his critical thinking in his special learning needs in Ankara province in Turkey in the 2020-2021 academic year's first term. Single-subject research was employed. The 2e student was ten years old. Through the application process, the 2e student argued 3D modeled Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. The main application's intervention was conducted to provide the research's internal validity since it was single-subject research. Through the intervention application, the 2e student argued 3D modeled Schrödinger's twin cats thought experiment. We noted both social dialectic argumentation processes as texts, and these texts were used as data collecting tools. Descriptive analysis was utilized to gathered data. The study showed that the 2e student could construct arguments containing claim, data, warrant, and weak rebuttals in the main application, which meant his argumentation quality level was average, so his critical thinking too. In contrast, the 2e student-constructed arguments containing claim, data, weak rebuttal, and rebuttal meant his argumentation quality level enhanced his critical thinking.",Journal of Science Learning,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ejournal.upi.edu/index.php/jslearning/article/download/85/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17509/jsl.v4i3.31570?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17509/jsl.v4i3.31570, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

When I was first approached back in 2015, the breadth of the journal, covering the whole of science, resonated with my own interests: my research career has ranged across the entire landscape of chemistry, while my leadership roles have embraced all of science, technology and medicine. The open access ethos, the objective refereeing policy that rejects the idea of only publishing what is in fashion, and the opportunities offered by a new venture that could transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries also all appealed to me. Among our successful innovations are Registered Reports, Replication Studies and the new ‘Science, Society and Policy' section. The challenges have included the transition to paid article processing charges (APCs), whether to resist pressure to retract a controversial paper, and bullying of young female authors by established senior males in the same field.

Every year, the state authorities adopt an administrative number of acts regulating various aspects of the activities of the scientific community. Often, documents introduce editorial changes, but some of them contain new provisions that significantly change the life of a scientist. For this reason, it is important to always be aware of the current state of the regulatory legal framework on the regulation of science, to understand the agenda of this process. The review contains information on the main regulatory legal acts on the regulation of the scientific and technical sphere for eight months of 2021. The documents are divided into groups according to their legal force: federal laws; decrees of the President of the Russian Federation; acts of the Government of the Russian Federation; departmental regulations of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation; recommendations of the Presidium of the Higher Attestation Commission of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia.",Science Management: Theory and Practice,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.19181/smtp.2021.3.3.11', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.19181/smtp.2021.3.3.11?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.19181/smtp.2021.3.3.11, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Throughout the past year, multiple vaccines have already been developed and used, while some others are in the process of being developed. However, the emergence of new mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 that have demonstrated immune-evading characteristics and an increase in infective capabilities leads to potential ineffectiveness of the vaccines against these variants. The purpose of this review article is to highlight the current understanding of the immunological mechanisms of the virus and vaccines, as well as to investigate some key variants and mutations of the virus driving the current pandemic and their impacts on current management guidelines. We also discussed new technologies being developed for the prevention, treatment, and detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we thoroughly reviewed and provided crucial information on SARS-CoV-2 virology, vaccines and drugs being used and developed for its prevention and treatment, as well as important variant strains. Our review paper will be beneficial to health care professionals and researchers so they can have a better understanding of the basic sciences, prevention, and clinical treatment of COVID-19 during the pandemic.

4a1942bf4fbad55ee7da3226ed48c0d3d062e3f1,Edward R. D. Scott (1947–2021): A tribute to an exceptional scientist and wonderful man,"Edward Robert Dalton Scott was born on March 22, 1947 in Heswall, England and died suddenly on October 7, 2021 in San Rafael, California, at the age of 74. He is survived by his wife Anneliese, his two daughters, Victoria and Rosemarie, and grandchildren Octavia, Theodore, Fiona, and Charlotte (the most recent addition, born November 19, 2021). Ed was a superb scientist with deep curiosity about the solar system and its origin, coupled with disarming modesty, a positive personality, a subtle sense of humor, and exceptional kindness. He will be missed. Ed received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Cambridge, England. Starting in October 1965, he was a student in the new Churchill College, about a mile from the university lecture theatres and labs in the city center. Like other Churchill residents making that journey morning, noon, and night, Ed became very fit and proficient on a bicycle, and pretty speedy, too. Ed studied mathematics, physics, and crystallography/mineralogy for 2 years then, fortunately for meteoritics, he concentrated during the third year on the last of these in the Department of Mineralogy and Petrology (colloquially known as “Min and Pet”). Min and Pet was a big tent, spanning subjects from crystal physics through to hard-rock geology. With his background in physics, Ed focused on X-ray crystallography, chemical thermodynamics, and mineralogy. He never took a formal geology course, but all students had to attend a field excursion to the Island of Skye during the final Easter Vacation, and there, in one of the worst weeks of wet and cold weather that Scotland has ever seen, Ian Sanders first got to know Ed as a friend. After graduating in 1968, Ed accepted a competitive entry position with the UK’s Central Electricity Generating Board, but he then turned it down. The Meteoritical Society owes a debt of gratitude to Stuart Agrell, a lecturer in Min and Pet who had an interest in iron meteorites. Agrell had secured a modest stipend to support a PhD student (far less than the electricity company would have paid), and yet he persuaded Ed that the pursuit of knowledge was more fulfilling than the pursuit of wealth. The rest is history: Ed went on to work on nearly every type of meteorite and published prolifically. He submitted his PhD thesis in 1971, within 3 years of starting. The outcome of the defense was never in question since, by then, he already had two Nature papers to his name (Buchwald & Scott, 1971; Scott, 1971). That same year he joined John Wasson’s group at the University of Meteoritics & Planetary Science 57, Nr 1, 154–157 (2022) doi: 10.1111/maps.13777",Meteoritics and Planetary Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/maps.13777', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/maps.13777?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/maps.13777, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c69f654bfc48c9db2538c4909b4ad12662767756,Assimilation of citizen science data in snowpack modeling using a new snow data set: Community Snow Observations,"Abstract. A physically based snowpack evolution and redistribution model was used to
test the effectiveness of assimilating crowd-sourced snow depth measurements collected by citizen scientists. The Community Snow Observations (CSO; https://communitysnowobs.org/, last access: 11 August 2021) project gathers, stores, and distributes measurements
of snow depth recorded by recreational users and snow professionals in high
mountain environments. These citizen science measurements are valuable since they come from terrain that is relatively undersampled and can offer in situ snow information in locations where snow information is sparse or
nonexistent. The present study investigates (1) the improvements to model
performance when citizen science measurements are assimilated, and (2) the
number of measurements necessary to obtain those improvements. Model
performance is assessed by comparing time series of observed (snow pillow)
and modeled snow water equivalent values, by comparing spatially distributed maps of observed (remotely sensed) and modeled snow depth, and by comparing fieldwork results from within the study area. The results demonstrate that few citizen science measurements are needed to obtain improvements in model performance, and these improvements are found in 62 % to 78 % of the ensemble simulations, depending on the model year. Model estimations of total water volume from a subregion of the study area also demonstrate improvements in accuracy after CSO measurements have been assimilated. These results suggest that even modest measurement efforts by citizen scientists have the potential to improve efforts to model snowpack processes in high mountain environments, with implications for water resource management and process-based snow modeling.

72994c9591d028253c72886bdd5cb50278a7333c,The discovery of meteorites near the Yamato Mountains: How the 1969 discoveries changed planetary science,"In December 1969, an inland survey party of the 10th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE10) serendipitously found a total of nine meteorites representing at least five distinct types (E, H, L, and CK chondrites, and a diogenite) on the bare ice fields near the Yamato Mountains (Figs. 1 and 2; Table 1; Yoshida et al. 1971; Yoshida 2010). In 1973, the JARE14 party found 12 more meteorites in the same area (Shiraishi et al. 1976). The implication of a possible concentration mechanism was immediately recognized. In the following year, the JARE-15 party conducted a systematic search for meteorites and collected 663 meteorites (Yanai 1976), opening the door to meteorite searches in Antarctica and the recovery of a large number of specimens. So far, JARE has conducted 24 expeditions between 1969 and 2013 where meteorite recovery was an important part of the project. The success of these early meteorite expeditions stimulated the international community (Shima and Shima 1973; Cassidy et al. 1977). As of this writing, more than 40,000 Antarctic meteorites have been collected, comprising ~60% of the world’s collections (Meteoritical Bulletin Database). Following the spirit of the Antarctic Treaty, which preserves Antarctica as an open platform for scientific research, the vast majority of these recovered specimens are publicly available. Thousands of researchers from around the world have collaborated on tens of thousands of meteorite specimens, resulting in hundreds of publications yearly. These recoveries have continued for 50 years, allowing new samples to be available as analytical capabilities have advanced. The first-order result of the recovery of Antarctic meteorites has been a dramatic improvement in our catalog of the materials that make up the solar system, representing not just its early moments but also the more “planetary” or geologic history of more evolved bodies such as the larger asteroids, the Moon, and Mars. The recovery of cosmic dust and micrometeorites from Antarctica (from ice, snow, and sediments) has similarly improved our understanding of the diversity of fine-grained materials in our solar system, through the discovery of a large number of new evolved, primitive, and pristine types. Antarctica truly is a treasure trove of extraterrestrial materials. What are the other contributions of Antarctic meteorites to the study of planetary materials? First, the large number of meteorites recovered means that rare and important samples are present that might be missing from smaller collections. These include lunar and Martian meteorites, first recognized within Antarctic collections. Those samples represented a paradigm shift in planetary materials research; proving that the Earth is continuously and actively sampling materials from throughout the solar system, and suggesting that Antarctic meteorites Fig. 1.

b58f39f85ba1fbcf9ff38f1636e3400f292db6ac,Green Chemistry: A Framework for a Sustainable Future,"F more than three decades, Green Chemistry has provided a framework for chemists and chemical engineers to do their part in contributing to the broad scope of global sustainability. American Chemical Society journals are a great venue for these scientists to share their latest results and provide a resource to the chemistry community and beyond for understanding current problems and envisioning solutions. We believe this is an opportune time to highlight some of the leading articles on the broad theme of Green Chemistry being published today through a Virtual Issue of selected works from nine ACS chemistry and engineering journals. The inception of this Virtual Issue is no coincidence. We have timed it to the 2021 Green Chemistry & Engineering Conference taking place virtually June 14−June 18. Now celebrating its 25th edition, we have seen progress toward more sustainable chemistries being showcased and celebrated at each GC&E conference. The theme of this year’s meeting, “Sustainable Production to Advance the Circular Economy”, is particularly bold. It highlights the recognition that contributions must take into account a systems approach to reducing environmental impact through intentional design of chemical products, not just considering how raw materials are sourced and in the manufacture and use of industrial and consumer goods but also how these materials and goods may be reused, recycled, or upcycled. The embrace of life-cycle thinking as a goal among the Green Chemistry community comes at the backdrop of the realization of limited resources and a climate crisis the likes of which most of us still fail to fully comprehend. We believe these selected articles are stepping stones on the pathway to advance closed-loop economies while still serving as models for innovation at a fundamental level within their respective chemistry subdisciplines. The drive for efficiency in organic synthesis merges the best of the idealisms of the Enlightenment and the Renaissance. Certainly, there is a premium on rationalism, with an aspiration of mechanistically sound reaction design and process development. But at the same time, the aesthetic appeal of the new ideas that culminate in the advances we now see routinely is unmistakable. There is no constraint on curiosity when we consider the boundary conditions of efficient, environmentally benign processes. On the contrary, these considerations spawn new concepts and approaches, ranging from postmodern expansions of photochemistry, reconsideration of seminal thinking about solvation, importation of physical and mechanical phenomena, to reaction developmentthe creativity born of efficiency considerations now drives major technology innovation in chemistry. The Journal of Organic Chemistry and Organic Letters are delighted to participate in this Virtual Issue with a selection of perspectives, research articles, and letters that highlight just some of the most impactful science in this arena, across a very wide swath of chemical space. Organometallics, a journal with a long-standing history of reporting fundamental advances in organometallic chemistry, catalysis, and materials, has selected contributions to this Virtual Issue that best highlight the diverse nature of this type of organometallic chemistry and that are likely to impact development of more sustainable chemical processes and the transition to a circular economy. ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering is a world leader in publishing groundbreaking research that addresses the challenges of sustainability, advancing the principles of Green Chemistry and Green Engineering with global reach and impact. Key coverage includes catalysis with emerging feedstocks and synthetic methods for preparing materials and chemicals in a sustainable way to help bring critical innovations from a research setting to commercialization. The journal takes pride in its central role in promoting innovations that will enable the implementation of a circular economy. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research publishes many, many papers in the Green Chemistry and sustainability space as these are core considerations in applied chemistry and chemical engineering. The ten articles in this Virtual Issue are just the tip of the iceberg and represent the types of papers readers can find in I&EC Research. We would encourage those interested in the Virtual Issue to browse through other recent issues of the journal, where they will quickly find other articles aligned with the themes of the conference. Contributions from Environmental Science & Technology and Environmental Science & Technology Letters clearly illustrate the interdisciplinary systems approach that is required to address key environmental challenges that impede sustainability effortsfrom remediation of pollution to design of next-generation safer and functional chemicals. Several of the high-impact contributions selected have been the subject of media coverage. Contributions from ACS Omega, an interdisciplinary open-access journal, were selected to highlight the potential impact of open-source publications and their importance in connecting scientists across industry and academia. With a similar goal, Organic Process Research & Development has a tradition of bridging industrial and academic research.

1403dae40a7cae509e52644e8138fcd242e8e81d,The Scientific Legacy of NASA’s Operation IceBridge,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Operation IceBridge (OIB) was a 13‐year (2009–2021) airborne mission to survey land and sea ice across the Arctic, Antarctic, and Alaska. Here, we review OIB’s goals, instruments, campaigns, key scientific results, and implications for future investigations of the cryosphere. OIB’s primary goal was to use airborne laser altimetry to bridge the gap in fine‐resolution elevation measurements of ice from space between the conclusion of NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat; 2003–2009) and its follow‐on, ICESat‐2 (launched 2018). Additional scientific requirements were intended to contextualize observed elevation changes using a multisensor suite of radar sounders, gravimeters, magnetometers, and cameras. Using 15 different aircraft, OIB conducted 968 science flights, of which 42% were repeat surveys of land ice, 42% were surveys of previously unmapped terrain across the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, Arctic ice caps, and Alaskan glaciers, and 16% were surveys of sea ice. The combination of an expansive instrument suite and breadth of surveys enabled numerous fundamental advances in our understanding of the Earth’s cryosphere. For land ice, OIB dramatically improved knowledge of interannual outlet‐glacier variability, ice‐sheet, and outlet‐glacier thicknesses, snowfall rates on ice sheets, fjord and sub‐ice‐shelf bathymetry, and ice‐sheet hydrology. Unanticipated discoveries included a reliable method for constraining the thickness within difficult‐to‐sound incised troughs beneath ice sheets, the extent of the firn aquifer within the Greenland Ice Sheet, the vulnerability of many Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers to ocean‐driven melting at their grounding zones, and the dominance of surface‐melt‐driven mass loss of Alaskan glaciers. For sea ice, OIB significantly advanced our understanding of spatiotemporal variability in sea ice freeboard and its snow cover, especially through combined analysis of fine‐resolution altimetry, visible imagery, and snow radar measurements of the overlying snow thickness. Such analyses led to the unanticipated discovery of an interdecadal decrease in snow thickness on Arctic sea ice and numerous opportunities to validate sea ice freeboards from satellite radar altimetry. While many of its data sets have yet to be fully explored, OIB’s scientific legacy has already demonstrated the value of sustained investment in reliable airborne platforms, airborne instrument development, interagency and international collaboration, and open and rapid data access to advance our understanding of Earth’s remote polar regions and their role in the Earth system.",Reviews of Geophysics,2021.0,70,"{'url': 'https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/53953/noaa_53953_DS1.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'public-domain', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1029/2020RG000712?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1029/2020RG000712, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

TheUnitedNations Decade on Biodiversity 2011–2020 has ended, and governments around the world are reviewing major international agreements relevant to biodiversity conservation, including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)1, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)2, and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)3. A Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework4 is under development, with the grandmission to “Halt the loss of species, ecosystems and genetic diversity by 2030; restore and recover biodiversity to ensure a world of people “living in harmony with nature’ by 2050”. Freshwater ecologists have acted quickly to draw attention to the global dimensions of the freshwater biodiversity crisis and address the lack of a comprehensive framework to guide policy responses (Bunn, 2016; Darwall et al., 2018). An Emergency Recovery Plan for freshwater biodiversity, published by 25 authors from 14 organizations (Tickner et al., 2020), sets out six major priorities for global action and policy development to “bend the curve of freshwater biodiversity loss.” It has been submitted to the working committees of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and further promoted as a dramatic OUPblog “Bring living waters back to our planet5” Comprehensive reviews have since enumerated many research questions, actions and policy refinements needed to “bend the curve” and protect the world’s freshwater ecosystems (van Rees et al., 2020; Buxton et al., 2021; Harper et al., 2021; Maasri et al., 2021). Each review cuts across important scientific, societal, management and policy issues. The purpose of this brief challenge paper is, likewise, to strengthen and support the Emergency Recovery Plan, but in a different way, by advocating a broader package of strategic activities that too often operate in silos, with patchy coverage of the world’s freshwater ecosystem types and biogeographic diversity. This package presents traditional areas of scientific and societal activity that require more strategic, integrated and collaborative global effort to deliver evidence-based freshwater conservation outcomes, conjoined with terrestrial and estuarine/marine conservation, depending on context: (i) inventory, evaluation and research; (ii) restoration and rehabilitation; (iii) protected area design and management; and (iv) socio-ecological science and governance. The paper is intended to motivate greater interest, commitment and collaboration of all stakeholders in the most urgent and ambitious conservation enterprise of the next decade—to protect and sustain freshwater biodiversity in the socio-ecological systems of the Anthropocene.",Frontiers in Environmental Science,2021.0,50,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2021.664313/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/fenvs.2021.664313?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.664313, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Several studies have shown that detecting SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater can be a useful tool to identify new outbreaks, establish outbreak trends, and assess the prevalence of infections. On 06 May 2021, over a year into the pandemic, we conducted a scoping review aiming to summarize research data on SARS-CoV-2 in sewage. Papers dealing with raw sewage collected at wastewater treatment plants, sewer networks, septic tanks, and sludge treatment facilities were included in this review. We also reviewed studies on sewage collected in community settings such as private or municipal hospitals, healthcare facilities, nursing homes, dormitories, campuses, airports, aircraft, and cruise ships. The literature search was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded 1090 results, 66 of which met the inclusion criteria and are discussed in this review. Studies from 26 countries worldwide have investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage of different origin. The percentage of positive samples in sewage ranged from 11.6 to 100%, with viral concentrations ranging from ˂LOD to 4.6 × 108 genome copies/L. This review outlines the evidence currently available on wastewater surveillance: (i) as an early warning system capable of predicting COVID-19 outbreaks days or weeks before clinical cases; (ii) as a tool capable of establishing trends in current outbreaks; (iii) estimating the prevalence of infections; and (iv) studying SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity. In conclusion, as a cost-effective, rapid, and reliable source of information on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in the population, wastewater surveillance can enhance genomic and epidemiological surveillance with independent and complementary data to inform public health decision-making during the ongoing pandemic.",Food and Environmnetal Virology,2021.0,56,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12560-021-09498-6.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'other-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8561373, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of COVID-19 on education using the Web of Science database. A methodology based on bibliometrics was used. Specifically, a scientific mapping of the literature was carried out, as well as a co-word analysis on the state of the question. The analysis included 940 publications. The results show that the institution with the highest volume of production in this field is the University of London. Among the journals, the Journal of Chemical Education stands out. Furthermore, in the analysis of the structural and thematic development of co-words, a high percentage of keyword matching was observed. In 2020, the motor themes were mental-health, organic-chemistry, general-public, first-year-undergraduate, and upper-division-undergraduate, while in 2021, they were autism-spectrum-disorder, adoption, internet, and intervention. It can be concluded that investigation into COVID-19 in the educational field is in its initial process. The research is currently mainly oriented to pedagogical methods, especially e-learning or collaborative learning, although they are not the only trends in this field.

However, it is unclear whether its efficacy is comparable to stretching. The goal was to systematically review and meta-analyze randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of ST and stretching on ROM (INPLASY 10.37766/inplasy2020.9.0098). (2) Methods: Cochrane Library, EBSCO, PubMed, Scielo, Scopus, and Web of Science were consulted in October 2020 and updated in March 2021, followed by search within reference lists and expert suggestions (no constraints on language or year). Eligibility criteria: (P) Humans of any condition; (I) ST interventions; (C) stretching (O) ROM; (S) supervised RCTs. (3) Results: Eleven articles (n = 452 participants) were included. Pooled data showed no differences between ST and stretching on ROM (ES = −0.22; 95% CI = −0.55 to 0.12; p = 0.206). Sub-group analyses based on risk of bias, active vs. passive ROM, and movement-per-joint analyses showed no between-protocol differences in ROM gains. (4) Conclusions: ST and stretching were not different in their effects on ROM, but the studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of design, protocols and populations, and so further research is warranted. However, the qualitative effects of all the studies were quite homogeneous.",Healthcare,2021.0,47,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/9/4/427/pdf?version=1617941093', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8067745, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ABSTRACT The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020 thrust instructors into a world of frenzy, presenting unique challenges to delivering course content. Especially challenging was how to substitute wet lab experiments that often comprise science labs. Recognizing that this problem was not short term, I started to look into virtual substitutions to be implemented in the 2020-2021 academic year.

Virtual simulations were examined in different platforms. These included Labster, McGraw Hill Connect Virtual labs, HHMI Biointeractive, Learn Genetics, Virtual Interactive Bacteriology Laboratory, and Biology Corner. The goal was to provide faculty around the world a reference list of virtual simulations that are aligned to specific AAAS and ASM student learning outcomes.

12c6eb3077d2be9c83f47180a79b86a57fc97f98,Best-Practice Coaches: An Untapped Resource in Sport-Science Research.,"aaa An individual’s performance development is regulated by a complex interaction of multiple factors. Our understanding of this interaction is far from complete, something that is likely part of the reason why intuition, experience, and tradition underpin the training and coaching of elite athletes to a greater extent than research-based evidence. Numerous scientific investigations over the years have been devoted to understanding the training and physiology of world-leading competitors. However, behind every successful athlete stands a coach. History has shown that the very best coaches often are years ahead of sport science in employing the critical features of training, including prescription, execution, individualization, periodization, organization, application of training methods, athlete profiling, technique supervision, feedback, tapering, and tactics.1–4 The gap between best practice and science grabbed my awareness in the early 1990s when I was a bachelor’s student and mediocre athletic sprinter. At that time, I had the privilege to practice in one of the most successful sprint groups in Europe, led by the Norwegian national-team sprint coach Leif Olav Alnes. My sprinting career is not worth mentioning, but the practical knowledge gained by observing, assisting, and participating in Norwegian athletics through the development of several elite sprinters has been invaluable for my later academic career. Today, 30 years later, Leif Olav is still going strong, coaching, among others, the 400-m hurdler Karsten Warholm. Under the wing of Leif Olav since 2015, Warholm has so far improved his personal best every year, from 51.09 seconds to a new world record of 46.70 seconds (as of July 1, 2021). While most world-leading sprinters and hurdlers improve their personal bests by ∼1% in the 5 years preceding peak performance (ie, ∼0.2% each year),5 Warholm has so far improved his performance by more than 8% since the age of 19. Obtaining the knowledge behind the training process leading to such a giant leap in performance would be priceless for coaches working with sprinting athletes. During the 1950s, New Zealander Arthur Lydiard (coach of Peter Snell and Murray Halberg) broke with contemporary middleand long-distance practice by prescribing a large volume of lowintensity running to his athletes during the preparation period, while the amount of high-intensity training was introduced gradually as the competition season approached. Lydiard’s training organization model is still valid, although refinements have been made over the years. Today, the training of Henrik, Filip, and Jakob Ingebrigtsen (three Norwegian brothers, all European 1500-m champions) gains attention in the middle-distance community, in which a larger proportion of their interval training seems to be performed at (not above) anaerobic threshold than is usual in contemporary practice. Other athletes have now started to adapt this training organization, likely creating a shift in current bestpractice training recommendations. Another example of coach leadership, this time in a team sport, is the results and achievements of Manchester United Football Club under the leadership of Alex Ferguson, winning 38 trophies over a 26-year period (including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups, and 2 UEFA Champions League titles). To capture the knowledge derived from best coaching and scientific practice, IJSPP aims to publish retrospective analysis of the training prescribed or performed by leading practitioners, prospective studies monitoring the longitudinal development of high-level athletes, and experiments or interventions (based on best-practice training) exploring the underlying mechanisms. In cases where the mysteries and secrets of the training process are challenging to quantify, an integrative and/or multidisciplinary approach may be required to capture a larger proportion of the knowledge underpinning the performance development. In this way, science will improve practice, and vice versa. It is somewhat surprising that learning from the very best coaches has received minimal attention in sport-science literature. A review of all original investigations and brief reports published in IJSPP from 2015 to 2021 (more than 1100 studies) reveals that coaches have been recruited as participants in less than 0.5% of the cases. Plausible reasons for this unexploited potential source might be related to lack of time and priority among coaches, uncertainty regarding what criteria make a good coach, and lack of verified methodology on how to systematize knowledge from coaches in our field. It is often hard to differentiate a great or good coach from an average one, as many coaches have achieved success despite limited experience and education. Many medium talents have been destroyed by coaches who tried to apply a program that worked well for a champion athlete. The successful sprint coach Leif Olav Alnes use to say that “it takes a hell of a bad coach to ruin a good athlete.” Unarguably, success with multiple athletes over time is a strong criterion for being considered a good coach. It is always challenging to distinguish general beliefs and scientific facts, and history has shown that both scientific and experiencebased “truths” have often only had temporary validity. The training science community should therefore strive to describe and verify what the best coaches claim to have known for a long time, and at the same time embrace coaches who have the guts to question research work in their field. This approach provides an effective means of establishing mechanistic connections between training, competitive performance, and underlying physiological determinants.",International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,2021.0,13,"{'url': 'https://journals.humankinetics.com/downloadpdf/journals/ijspp/16/9/article-p1215.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1123/ijspp.2021-0277?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2021-0277, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 2021. 312 pages. Hardcover; $29.95. ISBN: 9780674983519. *The Myth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a technical and philosophical introduction to AI with an emphasis on AI's limitations. Larson, a computer scientist and tech entrepreneur, keeps his central claim modest: true general AI is neither inevitable nor imminent, and if it is possible, it will require fundamentally new approaches. It is an easy read, combining references to fiction, history, and science. It lays out a bird's eye view of the origins and ideas behind current AI methods, focusing on general AI, a category of AI that would need to learn and engage with a wide variety of problems. *Separated into three parts, The Myth of AI begins with the history and algorithmic logic of AI, largely through the lens of the Turing test. Larson argues that we are not near the singularity (superintelligent computers able to create ever more intelligent machines) and that, in fact, the basic premise of the singularity is flawed. *The second part discusses inference. AI falls short of human intelligence because it can work with hard rules, but cannot make the guesses necessary to formulate new ones or handle uncertain rules. In attempts at the Turing test, AI can throw data at the problem but will always lack understanding. Achieving the understanding necessary for true intelligence will require an approach fundamentally different from recent advances made in AI, which are only effective for narrow AI (a category of AI for solving specialized problems) and not general AI. *The final, and relatively brief, part examines AI in science. According to Larson's assessment, new scientific research relies heavily on newly available computation power and big data in order to use narrow AI to its full extent. Larson claims that this approach will hinder development of new theories. He also claims that this leads to treating scientists as if they were computers as well, which causes overvaluing the system of science above people. He criticizes ""swarm science,"" which he describes as a large group of scientists approaching one problem with a variety of projects, emphasizing this collaboration over the individuals. Instead, he claims, we need our culture to continue to emphasize individual discovery and intelligence, as it is the key to innovation. *Through the discussions of the history, philosophy, and logic of AI in the first two parts of the book, Larson disentangles the hype of AI from what is actually possible with current technology. Even as he sheds light on the gap between the singularity prediction and what machine learning is truly capable of, he emphasizes the significance of the myth. ""The myth is an emotional lighthouse by which we navigate the AI topic"" (p. 76). The stories we tell through predictions and science fiction define AI in the public eye and set the goals for AI research. *Our underlying philosophy matters as much as the current state of AI research, when we consider the social role of AI and what we predict for our future. In the development of AI, we must define intelligence and explore what it means to be human. While this is not a book with overtly religious claims, it does acknowledge the spiritual claims inherent in discussions of personhood. It also frames technoscience as replacing philosophy and religion and as the oversimplified understanding of humanity and the precursor to expectations of the singularity. *Beyond the stated goal of disenchanting the reader of the inevitability of AI, the book highlights the significance of stories to both society and science and emphasizes the importance of understanding for both humans and AI. We need to understand not only the technical aspects of the technology we build but also the philosophy that defines our goals. *While I found the first two sections of the book to be an engaging and accurate discussion of the tension between the science and hopes of AI, I had concerns about the warnings of ""swarm science"" in the third. Larson is placing a strong emphasis on individual genius in science; however, science has never been a truly independent endeavor. Many times in history, from evolution to DNA, multiple teams of scientists independently made the same discoveries at nearly the same time, based on previously published work. Though these discoveries were not inevitable, they built upon other research and relied on collaboration at least as much as individual genius. Larson focuses on a particular neuroscience project and makes some valid criticisms, but then he generalizes his observations to all of science in ways that I do not believe to be accurate. His argument that all of science is moving away from theory toward shallow observations is not as obvious as he claims, nor is it supported by the evidence offered in the book. *As a counterexample, the research that resulted in the COVID-19 vaccine could be considered ""swarm science"" and was effective. Large amounts of funding were very suddenly directed to many scientists for one goal: understand and prevent the coronavirus. Due to both new funding and established research, we developed and approved multiple vaccines in one year. I was not convinced of several of Larson's generalizations in this third section. Tension between celebrating collaboration and individual genius will persist. However, it appears that there is more collaboration in science today. This is likely due to a variety of reasons, including a scientific community connected by the internet and more contributors receiving appropriate credit for their work. *The Myth of AI is a broad view of AI that should prove valuable and comprehensible to readers with or without a technical background. The first two sections offer a clear explanation and history of AI, and the third offers food for thought on how the process of science has been shaped by advances in AI and computer technology. The first sections would be a good introduction to someone not familiar with AI or looking to think about the philosophy of AI and I¬†would recommend the book for these sections. *While the book avoids religious claims, the philosophical discussions of what it means to ""understand"" and the level of trust we place in AI are essential questions for Christians working in technology-related disciplines. The Myth of AI presents a jumping-off point for much deeper reflection about using AI responsibly and what it means to be human. *Reviewed by Elizabeth Koning, graduate student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801.",Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith,2021.0,46,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4159/9780674259935?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4159/9780674259935, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Challenges to this sudden transformation include protecting student privacy while using online medical education services. Consequently, dealing with challenges to online medical education became a heated debate at Alfaisal University. This study aimed to determine the challenges of using webcams during online classes and the ensuing implications for medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted during the 2020-2021 academic year. The study investigators developed and validated a self-administered online questionnaire that targeted preclinical and clinical medical students at Alfaisal University, which is a private not-for-profit academic institution that was founded in 2008. Alfaisal University consists of five colleges: Medicine, Business, Engineering, Pharmacy, and Science. A total of 319 medical students completed the study questionnaire, with a response rate of 25%. The median age of the study sample was 21 years, with 63.3% females; 78.1% were in preclinical (first to third) years and 21.9% were in clinical (fourth to fifth) years. Of the respondents, 76.5% reported not using webcams when communicating via social media and 64.3% preferred blended learning, i.e., a combination of face-to-face and online learning. An overwhelming majority (91.5%) of study respondents were against using webcams in online classes for reasons including privacy (88.4%) and anxiety (64.4%). Privacy was the main concern of study respondents. Information about online privacy, including information being collected and how it will be used, should be provided to the students. Effective strategies to improve online learning experiences and protect the privacy of students should be explored.",Cureus,2021.0,34,"{'url': 'https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/47122/20210326-22207-f433ii.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7996672, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A rapid bench-to-bedside application of the lifesaving pancreatic extract and its immediate commercialization was the result of a promising idea, positive drive, perseverance, and collaboration of Banting and colleagues. As one of the very few proteins isolated in a pure form at that time, insulin also played a key role in the development of important methodologies and in the beginning of various fields of modern science. Since its discovery, insulin has evolved continuously to optimize the care of people with diabetes. Since the 1980s, recombinant DNA technology has been employed to engineer insulin analogs by modifying their amino acid sequence, which has resulted in the production of insulins with various profiles that are currently used. However, unmet needs in insulin treatment still exist, and several forms of future insulins are under development. In this review, we discuss the past, present, and future of insulin, including a history of ceaseless innovations and collective intelligence.

Inherent in its definition, TCAIMs are comprised of a wide variety of therapies with highly variable safety and effectiveness evidence profiles. Despite this, the use of many TCAIMs is highly prevalent among patients globally. The present study consists of a bibliometric analysis of TCAIM journals. Methods A single search of all International Standard Serial Number (ISSNs) of all journals categorized as “complementary and alternative medicine” (code 2707) based on the All Science Journal Classification (ASJC) was run on Scopus on April 17, 2021. All publication types were included; no further search limits were applied. The following bibliometric data were collected: number of publications (in total and per year), authors and journals; open access status; journals publishing the highest volume of literature and their impact factors; language, countries, institutional affiliations, and funding sponsors of publications; most productive authors; and highest-cited publications. Trends associated with this subset of publications were identified and presented. Bibliometric indicators of production were calculated, and bibliometric networks were constructed and visualized using the software tool VOSviewer. Results A total of 172,466 publications (42,331 open access), were published by 219,680 authors in 143 journals from 1938 to 2021. Since the 1940s, an upward trend with respect to the volume of publications can be observed, with a steep increase observed between the mid-2000s and mid-2010s. The journal that published the largest number of publications was the Journal of Natural Products ( n  = 15,144). The most productive countries included China ( n  = 45,860), the United States ( n  = 29,523), and Germany ( n  = 10,120); a number of the most common institutional affiliations and funding sponsors also originated from these three countries. Conclusions The number of publications collectively published in TCAIM journals follows an upward trend. Given a high prevalence of TCAIM use among patients, increased acceptance of TCAIM among conventional healthcare providers, and growing interest in the research of TCAIM, future work should continue to investigate and track changes in the publication characteristics of the emerging research on this topic.",BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies,2021.0,25,"{'url': 'https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12906-021-03354-7', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8246686, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Along with the massive digital dataset, it also gives the reform motivation to promote traditional teaching and learning. How to find the appropriate information that students are interested, valuable, and easy to be understood in the vast amount of information, and bring their creative ability, is still a difficult thing. A Recommender System (RS) for e-learning based on learners’ Science Knowledge (SK) is a powerful tool to solve such problems, which can guarantee the quality and efficiency of the science teaching and learning in the international context. It is one of science research directions with great research value. This paper discusses the overall framework design of a wisdom RS for conceptual learning (CL) in science, which analysis models are based on SK of the students, using a big data software platform. The research sample is made of totally 621 junior students who take the subject of an introductory in science concepts (SC) in Computer Studies of Program, Macao Polytechnic Institution, from 2006 to 2021 academic year. According to the students’ SK, their CL methods have been classified into six types of thinking modes, which has three different corresponding understanding levels for each mode. The appropriate recommended materials to the students who are interested in the information provided, such as, text-based teaching materials, computer assisted materials, simulation tools and game activities, can increases the motivations of the students to learn, considered their different characteristics and understanding. The performance of this RS has been tracked over a period of 16 years, which can effectively improve the personalized teaching quality in the area of computer science, since it may be useful in heightening students’ motivation and interest in CL in science.

Educational institutions across the globe were forced to temporarily close and use distance education as an alternative to face-to-face teaching. The current study explored the impact of the sudden transition from face-to-face learning to distance learning on students' psychology and learning. Four hundred and one (N=401) undergraduate students from the University of Petra, Jordan were surveyed using a user-designed online questionnaire. Results highlighted negative impacts of distance education on both participant's psychology and learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. More specifically, results showed that first and second year students and those with lower computer skills reported the highest negative psychological effects (i.e., feeling anxious, bored and nerves). Further first-year students and those with lower computer skill levels reported a negative impact on learning (i.e., experiencing lethargy and laziness when taking online lectures, poor focus and inability of being self-reliant when learning) by distance education when compared with students in their third and fourth year or those with higher and average computer skills. Finally, this paper discusses recommendations and implications for future distance learning. © 2021 Eskisehir Osmangazi University.

fa03be2ba2995ae8dece632dd973764bf12a0eed,Crowdsourcing Fungal Biodiversity: Approaches and standards used by an all-volunteer community science project,"Fungal Diversity Survey (FunDiS) is an all-volunteer community science organization that documents the diversity and distribution of macrofungi (visible with the naked eye) across North America. FunDiS addresses a key gap in biodiversity conservation: fungi, one of life’s major kingdoms, have been largely neglected in conservation efforts. Fungi are hyperdiverse: it is estimated that only 5% of fungal species have been described (Willis 2018), while support for professional taxonomists has been declining for decades. Therefore, FunDiS engages legions of amateur mycologists to document fungal diversity.
 Our participation model has four levels for crowdsourcing fungal biodiversity. It consists of a pyramid of participants and skills, continually drawing more people in at the base (simplest tasks), and encouraging them to move up to the next level.
 Level 1. Field observations: Community scientists document fungi in the field with georeferenced color photos and post observations on public, databased platforms; FunDiS uses iNaturalist and Mushroom Observer. FunDiS established a curated iNaturalist project called the FunDiS Diversity Database, inspired by FungiMap in Australia. Mushroom enthusiasts add observations, with the incentive that they will be reviewed by a team of expert identifiers. Another team of triagers goes through new observations, rejects those that do not follow FunDiS quality standards, and writes encouraging notes to posters on how to make observations more scientifically valuable. As of August 2021, there were almost 50,000 verifiable observations, of which 30,465 (including 3,204 species) were research grade and uploaded by iNaturalist onto the website of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Another FunDiS initiative, Rare Fungi Challenges, enlists amateurs to search for rare or threatened fungi.
 Level 2. Sequence: FunDiS built a program for amateurs to submit tissue for DNA sequencing and provided help interpreting results. Barcoding is especially needed to identify fungi because mopho-characteristics and images are often insufficient. Participants register projects, post observations to iNaturalist or Mushroom Observer, and apply to FunDiS for sequencing grants or pay out-of-pocket for sequencing. More than 200 local projects have been registered from Alaska to Puerto Rico, and Iceland to Hawaii. Some 7,000 specimens were sequenced by June 2021. Data are deposited in GenBank.
 Level 3. Voucher: FunDiS supports preserving well-documented, dried specimens in curated fungaria. To date, this participation level has developed slowly because of limitations of personnel and capacity of those institutions.
 Level 4. Super User: These are advanced observers with extensive field knowledge who have learned DNA technology; can teach others how to analyze DNA results and create phylogenies; and even describe new species. There are perhaps several dozen super users in the North American fungal science community.
 
 Challenges and lessons
 
 Feedback - Feedback to and from participants is critical to the success of community science projects. We have learned that it takes time and personnel to inspire rich interaction with participants in real time and that relying on volunteers with insufficient capacity for coordination, consistency and continuity often disappoints participants. Similarly DNA sequencing is intimidating to most amateurs. We found that guidance was needed for many participants just to correctly document, dry and submit tissue samples for sequencing. An even bigger challenge is making sense of the data that is generated, e.g., knowing if the sequence is of a described species or should be identified as a new species. Deep knowledge is needed for this kind of decision-making. In the past year we were fortunate to have the volunteer services of two professional mycologists and a doctoral student to analyze sequence data.
 Linking data - Linking data between field observations, genetic sequences and specimens is a major challenge. Our initial goal was to automate both external and internal data flows, but success has been limited with volunteer programmers. They managed to automate uploading iNaturalist and Mushroom Observer observations to our sequencing facility (Barcode of Life), but most other linkages have been tracked by volunteers on static spreadsheets.
 Paid staff - In retrospect, it was optimistic to attempt a project of such ambitious scope using only volunteer management and labor. The vast majority of community science projects are institution-based, with paid staff to manage and funds for outreach (Pocock et al. 2017). To continue at the present scale, we believe a core of paid staff is essential to leverage the large community we have been building.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2021.0,4,"{'url': 'https://biss.pensoft.net/article/74225/download/pdf/', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.5.74225?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.5.74225, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The aim of this review/meta-analysis is to synthesize the prevalence of post-COVID pain symptoms of musculoskeletal origin in hospitalized/non-hospitalized patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases, as well as medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint servers were searched up to May 1, 2021. Studies or preprints reporting data on post-COVID pain symptoms such as myalgias, arthralgias, or chest pain after SARS-CoV-2 infection and collected by personal, telephonic, or electronical interview were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random-effects models were used for meta-analytical pooled prevalence of each post-COVID musculoskeletal pain symptom. Data synthesis was categorized at onset or hospital admission, and at 30, 60, and 90, and ≥180 days after. From a total of 12,123 studies identified, 27 peer-reviewed studies and 6 preprints were included. The sample included 14,639 hospitalized and 11,070 non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The methodological quality of almost 70% studies was fair. The overall prevalence of post-COVID myalgia, joint pain, and chest pain ranged from 5.65% to 18.15%, 4.6% to 12.1%, and 7.8% to 23.6% respectively at different follow-up periods during the first year post-infection. Time trend analysis showed a decrease prevalence of musculoskeletal post-COVID pain from the symptom's onset to 30 days after, an increase 60 days after, but with a second decrease ≥180 days after. This meta-analysis has shown that almost 10% of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 will suffer from musculoskeletal post-COVID pain symptomatology at some time during the first year after the infection.",Pain,2021.0,93,"{'url': 'https://vbn.aau.dk/files/448597961/Time_course_prevalence_of_post_COVID_pain_symptoms.97878.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'other-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002496?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002496, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

51e05c61e2d9886b0cb6d3df81061d3924857eae,Proceedings from the 13th Annual Conference on the Science of Dissemination and Implementation,"In the midst of a global pandemic and heightened national attention to the pervasiveness and impact of systemic racism, the 13 Annual Conference on the Science of Dissemination and Implementation in Health focused on the theme of “Dissemination and Implementation Science in a Dynamic, Diverse, and Interconnected World: Meeting the Urgent Challenges of our Time.” Cohosted by the National Institutes of Health and AcademyHealth in collaboration with our co-sponsors the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), and the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the conference was held virtually December 15-17, 2020. While many virtual events attract fewer attendees than their in-person counterparts, the 2020 conference had the highest number of registrants: 1,587. As in prior years, a majority of attendees work in academic settings while 100 were students, 28 were patient scholarship recipients, and 133 participants joined us from 29 lowand middle-income countries. Over the three-day agenda, we hosted keynote and plenary sessions, concurrent podium and poster sessions, workshops and discussion forums, and multiple networking events. The call for abstracts generated 767 submissions, including individual paper presentations, individual posters, and panel presentations spread across nine thematic tracks. Over two hundred reviewers from multiple disciplines, sectors, settings, and career stages comprehensively assessed the abstracts within each track, coordinated by the track leads. New this year, we piloted a streamlined process for developing concurrent sessions for multiple tracks: We increased the number of reviewers per abstract for more robust scores, which were then used by track leads to assemble thematically relevant concurrent sessions among the most rigorous submissions. Both track leads and reviewers were extremely positive about the new process which we will fully implement going forward. This supplement includes 112 abstracts from the concurrent paper and panel sessions which represents a variety of dissemination and implementation research funded by our conference sponsors as well as other agencies, organizations, and systems. As in previous years, the conference was organized into nine thematic tracks: Behavioral Health, Clinical Care Settings (separated into two tracks: Patient-Level Interventions and System-Level Interventions), Global Dissemination and Implementation Science, Promoting Health Equity and Eliminating Disparities, Health Policy Dissemination and Implementation Science, Prevention and Public Health, and Models, Measures and Methods, and Building the Future of D & I Science: Training, Infrastructure, and Emerging Research Areas. This supplement is organized by these track themes. Slides and recordings of plenary and concurrent sessions (with the agreement of the authors) were posted on the conference website for 90 days after the conference. The additional 402 abstracts from the poster sessions are not included here but can be viewed at https://academyhealth.confex.com/academyhealth/2020di/meetingapp.cgi/ModulePosterSessions/0. The scientific programming for the conference was driven by the ongoing partnership between the NIH and AcademyHealth with substantial support from a multidisciplinary program planning committee which informed the plenary sessions, recruited key speakers, and helped to develop the topics for workshops and discussion forums. Our keynote and three plenary panels all turned their attention to the challenges of and opportunities in addressing the global health crises and how D&I science can provide direct benefit to ongoing issues of access, implementation and scale-up of evidence-based care. Dr. Ashish Jha opened the conferences with a talk on “The Pandemic Response: Misadventures in Evidence, Communication, and Implementation” highlighting the challenges of effective communication and implementation in the face of rapidly evolving evidence, as well as the limitations in that evidence, particularly regarding systematically documenting health disparities. Dr. Jha highlighted the challenges of actions in the face of limited evidence as well as the challenges of misinformation and disinformation and emphasized the importance of humility particularly among our public health leaders. He concluded with three recommendations for the Implementation Science 2021, 16(Suppl 1):49 https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-021-01110-6",Implementation Science,2021.0,3,"{'url': 'https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13012-021-01110-6', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8134818, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c82d8d43543f67a2cdac1b6bc7b75af43b9a24b7,The China Space Station: a new opportunity for space science,"The space station is a large-scale and comprehensive research facility capable of long-term human habitation in near-Earth space, with systematic support by space transport and widely covered tracking, telemetry, command and communication. It allows extensive and long-term research under the special conditions of space and responds to urgent scientific needs in space in a timely manner. Since the first manned space flight in 1961, two emerging trends have influenced international human space activities.The first trend is manned space exploration represented by the remarkable Apollo program that landed astronauts on the moon. To date, some human space projects have ambitious plans to explore the moon and beyond. The second trend is space science researchperformedby astronauts in space.Dozens of space laboratories and space stations have been launched, such as the Salute series laboratory, Skylab, the shuttle-borne series laboratory, Mir Space Station and International Space Station currently still in operation. About 20 000 experiments have been conducted, including large-scale scientific research and important technology verification, opening new research directions for space life science and human science, as well as microgravity science that uses microgravity conditions to study the movement of matter and basic physical laws. These experiments also expanded research into space astronomy, solar system science, Earth science, the space environment and new technology, thus playing an irreplaceable role in the human understanding of nature, and promoting scientific and technological advances. In the past, the development of space science in China was limited by the small scale of space activities and the lack of opportunities for space experiments. Now, construction on the China Space Station (CSS) has begun, with the core module launched in 2021. It will become themost important near-Earth space laboratory for China and the world in the next 10 years. As a result of China’s 30-year effort inmanned projects, theCSS offers the opportunity for large-scale scientific research that will benefit Chinese scientists and their international peers. Research in four areas has been planned for the CSS. Space life science and human research will investigate the nature of life phenomena and their reactions to microgravity conditions, biomedical issues relating to long-term space exploration, and biotechnology for maintaining human health.Microgravity physics will focus on fundamental physical laws, as well as basic research for application in fluid mechanics, thermophysics and combustion and materials science, with a goal of supporting ground industries. Space astronomy and Earth science will aim to deepen our understanding of dark matter, dark energy, compact objects, galaxy formation and evolution, and the global changes of the Earth. New space technology will develop and verify a new generation of space technology for science and space application. In order to support research in various fields, the CSS is developing major supporting research facilities such as the 2-meter-diameter China Sky Survey Telescope and the High Energy Cosmic-Radiation Detector. Fourteen experimental racks and three extravehicular exposure devices have been deployed, including the Life and Ecology Research Rack, BiotechnologyResearchRack, Fluid Physics ResearchRack,ColdAtom Physics Research Rack, High Precision Time-Frequency System, High-Temperature Materials Research Rack, ContainerFree Materials Processing Rack and Combustion Sciences Research Rack. Further scientific planning and upgrading of experimental devices will continue in the future. TheCSS is fully open to international researchers, and guides for theopen solicitationof researchproposalswill be regularly issued. International scientists may submit proposals through the China Manned Space Engineering Office, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, or national space agencies under bilateral cooperation agreements. Chinese scientists look forward to extensive cooperation with scientists around the globe, and hope that research activities in the CSS will make a unique contribution to our collective understanding of nature.Through effective dissemination of scientific findings, CSS research programs will promote an understanding and passion for science to the general public, especially to young people.",National Science Review,2021.0,2,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article-pdf/9/1/nwab219/44252328/nwab219.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8783667, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8e89d9557081deb4aee73ba10b30d00775be061e,Novel Unilateral Dental Expander Appliance (UDEX): A Compound Innovative Materials,"True unilateral posterior crossbite in adults is a challenging malocclusion to treat, especially when we need to correct cross-arch segments with unwanted effects on non-cross segments. Conventional expansion methods are expected to have some shortcomings;the Unilateral dental expander appliance used to restore unilateral cross bite dental arch is an uncommon appliance;for this, a designed new device is needed. This paper aimed to invite a new unilateral dental expander appliance (UDEX) to treat unilateral dental posterior crossbite in adults using available dental material, easy to use and handle, well tolerated by the patient, and biocompatible with oral structure. It could find that in all dental markets and dental clinics-an eighteen-year-old female with bilateral crossbite and upper and lower dental arch crowding. During active orthodontic treatment, a quad-helix expander had broken from one side at soldering between band and wire attachment. The patient did not show up to the clinic for a while due to COVID 19 pandemic lockdown, leading to a true unilateral crossbite at the dental arch's upper left side, especially at the molar premolars area. This unilateral cross bite was treated using a new specially designed expanded appliance as a unilateral posterior cross bite dental maxillary expander. As a result of this study, orthodontic treatment was finished within (15) months, much less than expected. We obtained Class I molar and canine relationships with uncrossed dental arches in both upper arch sides, proper overbite and overjet with well-leveled and aligned teeth as it confirmed by clinical examination and radiographic images (OPG (Orthopantomogram) and cephalometric radiograph (WebCeph analysis digitalized computer program). Conclude from that, the newly designed unilateral dental expander (UDEX) is proven to be useful for treating real unilateral posterior crossbites as single molar or premolar tooth andmultiple joint unilateral crossed posterior teeth. Also, it could easily modify it for future unilateral crossed purposes. This appliance was fabricated using readily available dental material, well tolerated by patients, and reduced the need for excessive patient compliance. An orthodontist could fabricate devices, or cautious laboratory work is required;it can rapidly achieve favorable results. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Methods We used Web of Science to identify the 100 most frequently cited papers on SBRT on September 29, 2021 and extracted the following data: publication year, source title, country/region, organization, total citations, and average number of citations per year. The research type and research domain were classified independently by the authors. Then we carried out a bibliometric analysis to determine the trends in research on SBRT. Results These 100 papers were cited a total of 26,540 times, and the median number of citations was 190 (range, 138-1688). “Stereotactic body radiation therapy for inoperable early stage lung cancer” by Timmerman et al. had the highest number of total citations (1688 times). International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics published the largest number of papers (37 papers), followed by Journal of Clinical Oncology (13 papers). The USA contributed the most papers (67 papers), followed by Canada (18 papers). Primary lung cancer (33 papers, 10,683 citations) and oligometastases (30 papers, 7,147 citations) were the most cited research areas. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bibliometric analysis of the most frequently cited papers on SBRT. Our results provide insight into the historical development of SBRT and important advances in its application to cancer treatment. Early-stage non–small-cell lung cancer and oligometastases were the most cited research areas in the top 100 publications on SBRT, and SBRT combined with immunotherapy was a hot topic in the past few years.

Repeated efforts to deliver it orally since then have met with failure, with particular disappointment resulting from encouraging preclinical studies in the 1980s. Here, the barriers to synthesizing successful oral inulin formulations are discussed. It is apparent that this peptide has chemistry and pharmacology features that make its oral delivery one of the toughest challenges in delivery science.

a25653409cb0b138adc4a24168efbe2176fe2c98,The Unified Medical Language System at 30 Years and How It Is Used and Published: Systematic Review and Content Analysis,"Background The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) has been a critical tool in biomedical and health informatics, and the year 2021 marks its 30th anniversary. The UMLS brings together many broadly used vocabularies and standards in the biomedical field to facilitate interoperability among different computer systems and applications. Objective Despite its longevity, there is no comprehensive publication analysis of the use of the UMLS. Thus, this review and analysis is conducted to provide an overview of the UMLS and its use in English-language peer-reviewed publications, with the objective of providing a comprehensive understanding of how the UMLS has been used in English-language peer-reviewed publications over the last 30 years. Methods PubMed, ACM Digital Library, and the Nursing & Allied Health Database were used to search for studies. The primary search strategy was as follows: UMLS was used as a Medical Subject Headings term or a keyword or appeared in the title or abstract. Only English-language publications were considered. The publications were screened first, then coded and categorized iteratively, following the grounded theory. The review process followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results A total of 943 publications were included in the final analysis. Moreover, 32 publications were categorized into 2 categories; hence the total number of publications before duplicates are removed is 975. After analysis and categorization of the publications, UMLS was found to be used in the following emerging themes or areas (the number of publications and their respective percentages are given in parentheses): natural language processing (230/975, 23.6%), information retrieval (125/975, 12.8%), terminology study (90/975, 9.2%), ontology and modeling (80/975, 8.2%), medical subdomains (76/975, 7.8%), other language studies (53/975, 5.4%), artificial intelligence tools and applications (46/975, 4.7%), patient care (35/975, 3.6%), data mining and knowledge discovery (25/975, 2.6%), medical education (20/975, 2.1%), degree-related theses (13/975, 1.3%), digital library (5/975, 0.5%), and the UMLS itself (150/975, 15.4%), as well as the UMLS for other purposes (27/975, 2.8%). Conclusions The UMLS has been used successfully in patient care, medical education, digital libraries, and software development, as originally planned, as well as in degree-related theses, the building of artificial intelligence tools, data mining and knowledge discovery, foundational work in methodology, and middle layers that may lead to advanced products. Natural language processing, the UMLS itself, and information retrieval are the 3 most common themes that emerged among the included publications.

088f8df2752eb7ec4c01281ae23773b114895970,Ecological civilization: a revived perspective on the relationship between humanity and nature,"This is a prodigious year for introspection by humanity about our relationship with nature.The year 2021 is marked with four important global meetings: the 44th session of the World Heritage Committee of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) scheduled in July, China; the IUCNWorldConservationCongress in September, France; the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in October, China; and the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in November, UK. All four meetings are germane to biodiversity conservation, and all will contribute to setting the future global agenda for conservation and sustainable development. In particular, CBD COP 15 will take the leading role in this regard, to review and adopt the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and associated implementation mechanisms for the 2030 mission and for the 2050 vision. These global targets aim to bend the curve of biodiversity loss [1] by effective efforts in conservation, restoration and sustainable production and consumption. How to formulate SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timebound) GBF targets to support and meet the goals is the major focus, and these targets must reflect and accommodate multiple viewpoints from different parties and relevant organizations. As the host party for CBD COP 15, China is working hard in cooperation with the CBD Secretariat and relevant parties and organizations to promote the preparation of the meeting, and the associated negotiations on key documents for COP 15.The theme for the COP, ‘Ecological Civilization: building a shared future for all life on Earth’, was officially released to reflect Chinesewisdom and philosophy. China promotes the development of ecological civilization and has made remarkable progress in realizing this vision. As Xi Jinping said, ‘We need to take up our lofty responsibility for the entire human civilization, and we need to respect Nature, follow its laws and protect it. We need to find a way for man and nature to live in harmony, balance and coordinate economic development and ecological protection, and work together to build a prosperous, clean and beautiful world’ [2]. COP 15 offers an opportunity for the world to better know and understand China. In this sense, we organized a special collection of papers to showcase the critical views and research progress in biodiversity science and conservation by the academic community of China together with international colleagues. Wei et al. presents the philosophical underpinnings, institutional frameworks and accomplishments of ecological civilization in China. Serving as an agent for transformative change, the concept of ecological civilization and associated actions in China provides important insights and great potential to build a shared future for all life on Earth. We hope that China’s experiences can stimulate a global conversation onhowbest to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the goal of living in harmonywith nature in amanner that respects diverse national contexts [3]. Ecological civilization is an eco-innovation, rooted in the traditional wisdom of Unity of Nature and Humanity, to harmonize the apparent contradiction between economic development and environmental protection, including biodiversity conservation. As biodiversity is a multifaceted issue intertwined with human development, integrated approaches are needed to simultaneously achieve the conservation goals and related human well-being improvements, and to seek a balance in the conceptual framework of Unity of Nature and Humanity [4]. As a critical priority, countries need to design and implement integrated national strategies to achieve the goals of the three RioConventions (including theUNConvention toCombatDesertification—UNCCD,UNFCCCandCBD)using spatially explicit analyses and policies. This integration can maximize co-benefits and help manage trade-offs to meet the SDGs, and maximize the retention of biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Nature-based solutions (NBSs) provide an important framework for such integration. Countries can learn from experiences in China and elsewhere, such as Brazil’s forest code to integrate nature, climate and sustainablemanagementof land and ocean, and work to include targeted conservation and restoration of nature into their long-term low-emission development strategies [5]. Setting targets for addressing major global concerns such as biodiversity loss is an essential prerequisite for concerted global action (both inside and outside multilateral environmental agreements). However, most operational targets are socio-political choices rather than science-based decisions.

In this work we study the impact of three different technologies, 1) SMART, Science Monitoring and Reliable Telecommunications; 2) DAS, Distributed Acoustic Sensing, and; 3) LI, Laser Interferometry, for effective earthquake and tsunami monitoring capabilities on the NE Atlantic. The SW Iberia is the source area of the largest destructive earthquake that struck Europe since the year 1000, the November 1, 1755 event. This earthquake generated also a destructive tsunami affecting the whole basin. This tectonically active area is crossed by the CAM (Continent-Azores-Madeira) submarine cable on a ring configuration. Due to the end of cable lifetime the current cables need to be replaced by 2024 and the technical requirements must be defined in mid-2021. The Azores archipelago is the focus of frequent seismic crizes and occasionally destructive earthquakes. A common feature of these seismic events is that they take place offshore, an area that is difficult to monitor from land-based instruments. In this work we evaluate the contribution of SMART cables to the earthquake monitoring and tsunami early warning system in SW Iberia and show how DAS and LI can improve earthquake monitoring on two active domains of the Azores. For tsunami early warning, we show how the offshore sea-level measurements provide clean offshore tsunami records when compared to coastal observations by tide gauges, which greatly improves the efficiency of the system. For earthquake monitoring, the data processing operational routine is examined using Monte-Carlo simulations. These take into consideration the errors in phase picking and the uncertainty on the 1D velocity model used for earthquake location. Quality of earthquake location is examined using the difference between the true location and the centroid of the computed epicenters and by the overall ellipse of uncertainty obtained from 100 runs. The added value provided by instrumented submarine telecommunication cables to mitigate earthquake and tsunami risk demonstrated in this work will help authorities and the society in general to take the political decisions required for its full implementation worldwide.",Frontiers in Earth Science,2021.0,13,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2021.686296/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/feart.2021.686296?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.686296, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The participants were selected private school elementary teachers in Pagadian City offering Online Modality in School Year 2020-2021. The study was based on the interpretivist paradigm since the researcher used social skills to construct knowledge and meaning. Case study was utilized. Teachers' experiences include perception, way of delivering instruction using online platforms, struggles, adjustments, and suggestions for improvement. The study is supported with data from multiple sources: Interview Guide Questions, Principals’ Evaluation Form, and Researcher’s Checklist. Participants perceived online modality as agent of continuity of learning, and challenging. It showed that Zoom teleconferencing is the preferable online platform to use. The participants’ struggles were power interruption, poor internet connectivity, computer technology operations, imposition of classroom management, lack of preparation, and getting used to another personal work-schedule. The participants' adjustments pointed to acceptance of situation, self-exploration, asking teaching materials, and knowledge-skill support from the school. The participants and principals' responses led to attending trainings regarding Online Teaching Methodology in general.

Recently, we reviewed studies using ABR measurements in tinnitus rat models. We found significant discrepancies in the outcomes of these studies, some due to different research approaches and others due to different methodologies. Thus, the present work aimed to collect comprehensive information on all factors influencing ABR recordings in rats and compile recommendations on ABR data reporting. A questionnaire with queries about animal husbandry, transfer, handling, and the exact test conditions before, during, and after ABR recordings was sent to 125 researchers who published the relevant studies between 2015 and 2021. Eighteen researchers provided detailed answers on factors related to ABR measurements. Based on the analysis of the returned questionnaires, we identified three domains reflecting animal-, equipment-, and experiment-dependent factors that might influence the ABR outcome, thus requiring reporting in published research. The analysis of survey results led to the compilation of recommendations for reporting ABR outcomes supported by a literature review. Following these recommendations should facilitate comparative and meta-analyses of ABR results provided by various research groups.",Brain Science,2021.0,9,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/11/12/1596/pdf?version=1638419342', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8699229, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

183d703761b494f4646aea583db35b4b8411e3c0,A case of acute necrotising pancreatitis following the second dose of Pfizer‐BioNTech COVID‐19 mRNA vaccine,"A case of acute necrotising pancreatitis following the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccineAs of 22 June 2021, there have been about 400,000,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine administered world-wide. At this time, 176 cases of pancreatitis have been reported in pharmacovigilance reports submitted to the WHO.1 No epidemiological link between the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and pancreatitis has been reported. We report a case of acute necrotising pancreatitis following the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. This case has been reported to the New Zealand Pharmacovigilance Centre and the patient has consented to publication of the case report.A 43-year-old, NZ European male was diagnosed with acute necrotising pancreatitis 10 hours following the administration of his second Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. He has a background of atopy with seasonal rhinitis, eczema and asthma, all of which are ‘mild’. He takes no regular medications and takes as needed melatonin 2 mg nocte, cetirizine 10 mg for hay fever, and betamethasone and emollient cream for dermatitis. He has no family history of note and works in a senior professional role. He drinks six standard units of alcohol per week, has never been a tobacco smoker and does not use recreational drugs – and his employer undertakes regular drug testing.He had a previous episode of pancreatitis in 2011, precipitated by high alcohol intake during a holiday abroad. He is otherwise previously well. There is no family history of note, his father was a smoker and died of lung cancer in his 60s, his mother is well, he has two siblings and three children all of whom are well. He is not aware of any diseases of note in his extended family.In May 2021 he received his second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, he was well at that time. Four hours after the dose he had two 330ml bottles of 5% alcohol beer with his dinner. Six hours after the dose he became unwell with nausea, epigastric pain, and vomiting. Ten hours after the dose blood tests on admission to hospital included: white cell count 18.5 x109/L (4 - 11), neutrophils 15.5 x109/L (1.9 - 7.5), lymphocytes 0.8 x109/L (1.0 - 4.0), CRP <3 mg/L (<5), lipase 23,750 U/L (10 – 70), and triglycerides 3.3 mmol/L. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed. An ultrasound scan showed pancreatitis without evidence of cholelithiasis. He subsequently deteriorated and a computer tomography (CT) scan on 17 May, day 9 of the illness, showed severe necrotising pancreatitis with collections.During the admission under a specialist hepatobiliary surgical team, known causes of pancreatitis were excluded including: steroid use, trauma, family history of autoimmune conditions, and infection. He did not have the risk factors of obesity, smoking or heavy alcohol consumption. He had the risk factor of a previous episode of acute pancreatitis. The incidence of pancreatitis in New Zealand Europeans in this age group is approximately 50 per 100,000 per year.2 Idiopathic cases represent about 15% of these.Using the Naranjo criteria, the pancreatitis being ’caused’ by the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine score was 6 ‘probable’.3 Clinical case discussion (including a hepatobiliary surgeon, gastroenterologist and clinical pharmacologist) concluded that while idiopathic pancreatitis could not be excluded, the onset of symptoms and findings were consistent with an acute precipitating event around the time the second vaccine dose was administered.In addition to the 176 cases reported in VigiBase™, searches of PubMed and Google Scholar™ identified two published case reports of pancreatitis following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. These were following administration of the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. In one case symptoms developed several hours after vaccine administration and the other several days after vaccine administration.4,5Acute pancreatitis is a rare in patients with COVID-19 but characteristic patterns of illness have been reported.6 This raises the possibility that an immune response to either the virus or the vaccine could have common sequalae.This case of acute pancreatitis was temporally associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine suggesting a causal link. The characteristics of pancreatitis cases associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine should be examined to see if a consistent pattern is present.VigiAccess™ http://www.vigiaccess.org/ - accessed June 24, 2021.Pendharkar SA, Mathew J, Zhao J, Windsor JA, Exeter J, Petrov MS.

The study aimed to identify therapeutic approaches and drugs that can potentially be used as interventions in Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) management. A systematic scoping review was conducted. Articles reporting clinical evidence of therapeutic management of COVID-19 were selected from three different research databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct). From the database search, 31 articles were selected based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review paper showed that remdesivir and ivermectin significantly reduced viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) activity. On the other hand, convalescent plasma (CP) significantly improved COVID-19 clinical symptoms. Additionally, the use of corticosteroid increased survival rates in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Findings also indicated that both hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir were effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, lopinavir–ritonavir combination was not effective against COVID-19. Finally, ribavirin, galidesivir, and sofosbuvir showed potential therapeutic benefit in treating COVID-19, but there is a lack of clinical evidence on their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2.

The University of California (UC) System developed a set of recommendations to reduce campus infection rates. SARS-CoV-2 test results are summarized for the ten UC campuses during the Fall 2020 term. Methods UC mitigation efforts included protocols for the arrival of students living on-campus students, non-pharmaceutical interventions, daily symptom monitoring, symptomatic testing, asymptomatic surveillance testing, isolation and quarantine protocols, student ambassador programs for health education, campus health and safety pledges, and lowered density of on-campus student housing. We used data from UC campuses, the UC Health–California Department of Public Health Data Modeling Consortium, and the U.S. Census to estimate the proportion of each campus’ student populations that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and compared it to the fraction individuals aged 20–29 years who tested positive in their respective counties. Results SARS-CoV-2 cases in campus populations were generally low in September and October 2020, but increased in November and especially December, and were highest in early to mid-January 2021, mirroring case trajectories in their respective counties. Many students were infected during the Thanksgiving and winter holiday recesses and were detected as cases upon returning to campus. The proportion of students who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during Fall 2020 ranged from 1.2% to 5.2% for students living on campus and was similar to students living off campus. For most UC campuses the proportion of students testing positive was lower than that for the 20–29-year-old population in which campuses were located. Conclusions The layered mitigation approach used on UC campuses, informed by public health science and augmented perhaps by a more compliant population, likely minimized campus transmission and outbreaks and limited transmission to surrounding communities. University policies that include these mitigation efforts in Fall 2020 along with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, may alleviate some local concerns about college students returning to communities and facilitate resumption of normal campus operations and in-person instruction.",PLoS ONE,2021.0,22,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258738', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8568179, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7011c9fdc80ab65217b589b2637d867daf9d7fac,The Reptile Database: Curating the biodiversity literature without funding,"The Reptile Database (RDB) curates the literature and taxonomy for about 14,000 species and subspecies of reptiles (Uetz et al. 2021). Together with a few other databases, the RDB curates the literature for about 70,000 species of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.
 While it acts as a current name list for extant reptile taxa, including synonymies, it also collects images (currently ~18,000, representing half of all species), type information, diagnoses and descriptions, and a bibliography of 62,000 references, most of which are linked to online sources.
 The database is also extensively cross-referenced to citizen science projects (iNaturalist), the NCBI taxonomy, the IUCN Red List, and several others, and serves as data provider (for reptiles) for the Catalogue of Life.
 A major challenge for the Reptile database is the consistent curation of the literature, which requires the addition of about 2000 papers a year, including about 200 new species descriptions and numerous taxonomic changes. For instance, during the past five years, almost 1000 species changed their names, in addition to the ~900 species that were newly described, i.e., almost 20% of all reptile species were described or changed their name within just a half decade!
 While the database can keep track of name changes, it remains a largely unsolved problem of how these name changes can or should be translated into related databases such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which keeps track of the literature independently (but exchanges data with the RDB). Some sites use the web services of the RDB to update their taxonomy, such as Calphotos or iNaturalist, but many do not or have not been able to implement automated name tracking.
 The RDB also works with the Global Assessment of Reptile Distributions (GARD Initiative) to keep track of range changes. After GARD published a collection of ~10,000 range maps for reptiles in 2017, more than half of these maps have changed in area size by more than 5% since the initial release.
 The database has developed several avenues for streamlining and optimizing curation of the literature, e.g., (semi-) automated requests for publications, species descriptions, and photos from authors, but the process is far from fully automated.

4d0201543b6fdb3d3e203a234c0ce0571cb8b59c,Complexity and COVID‐19: Leadership and Followership in a Complex World,"As a complexity leadership scholar, the past year has been witness to what we and complexity theorists in the organizational sciences have been saying since the 1990s: the world is increasing in complexity and if we are to keep up with it, we must apply new ways of thinking (Anderson, 1999; Stacey, 1995; UhlBien et al., 2007). Traditional topdown and ‘hero’ models of leadership help us know what it is like to lead on an individual basis as a manager having to motivate and inspire a subordinate, or a CEO having to position an organizational strategically. They do not, however, capture the lived experience of navigating leadership in a complex world. For this we must better understand how leadership enables people and organizations for adaptability (UhlBien and Arena, 2018). The good news is that businesses largely get it. The complexity of the past decades has forced business organizations to be lean and agile. As a result, when the pandemic hit, they were able to pivot and rapidly implement adaptive solutions to complex challenges: remote work in business, telehealth in medicine, online education in schools, and expanded takeout and ghost kitchens in the restaurant industry. The bad news is that publicsector and political leadership lag behind. Many still largely operate in outdated governance and political systems mired in bureaucracy and cronyism that work against collaborating for the greater good, resulting in countless unnecessary deaths and a traumatized healthcare workforce – the consequences of which we will be dealing with for years. For all those who argue that leadership doesn’t matter, 2020 proves them wrong: leadership can be, literally, the difference between life and death.

The three astronauts became the first visitors of the CSS and would stay in orbit for about three months. In 2022, two laboratory cabin modules, Wentian and Mengtian, will be launched and assembled into Tianhe, completing the basic structure of the CSS. The CSS is designed to be used for at least 10 years, and will provide an outer space experimental platform for researchers from multiple disciplines. On 23 July 2021, National Science Review (NSR) interviewed Professor Ming Gao (高铭), the Commander-in-Chief of the Space Utilizaiton System of the China Manned Space Program, Director General of the Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization (CSU) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and an Academician of the International Academy of Astronautics. The Space Utilizaiton System is the scientific part of the CSS project, responsible for the design and organization of the onboard research programs.

COMAT started in 2010 so the last year we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the conference and also the 20th anniversary of COMTES FHT Inc. The conference was organized by traditional tandem COMTES FHT Inc. and TANGER Ltd. There were big plans to celebrate these anniversaries with adequate dignity. However, the COVID-19 has changed it, as well as many other things and we ended up with a significantly reduced event. Although the situation was not positive, we highly appreciated interest of participants from Europe and Asia. We received many papers for publication in proceedings out of which 67 were selected for the proceedings publication. Due to an uncertain situation and almost a global lock-down it took much longer to finalize the review process this time. We would like to thank very much to reviewers and authors for their comments and papers corrections. Anyway, we are finally here and we hope the papers presented in the proceedings will be interesting for all readers. We are looking forward to seeing you all personally at COMAT 2022.

f5c6407bbc2d2682668ff8c0853b88e677e8695f,Editorial,"Dear Readers,
 It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to our first regular issue in 2021 covering 3 very relevant and novel articles in various computer science topics.
 There are also many news and changes with the beginning of the new year that I am excited to report on and share. To start with, we are very happy to welcome two new consortium members and editors-in-chief: California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo represented by Prof. Christian Eckhardt from the Department of Computer Science & Software Engineering and the Institute for IDEAS at American University in Washington DC represented by Prof. Krzysztof Pietroszek. On the management side of J.UCS, Dana Kaiser has retired at the end of last year, and on behalf of the journal I want to gratefully thank Dana for her devoted and great work since the foundation of this journal. I also want to give Johanna Zeisberg a warm welcome who will take over the role as Publishing Manager and collaborate and support the whole J.UCS community. On the technical side, our journal has moved to another submission and publishing platform. Since the foundation of J.UCS more than 25 years ago, the journal has offered readers, authors and editors various novel features over the course of the years. In this perspective but also in terms of the visionary view of founding a freely accessibly online journal, I want to express our deep gratitude for the contributions of Prof. Hermann Maurer to the success of J.UCS for almost 20 years. Since beginning of 2021, J.UCS is hosted by Pensoft Publishers Ltd. on the ARPHA Publishing Platform. This allows us not only to offer state-of-the-art publishing features but also to make use of integrated long-time archiving systems and various indexing services. In this context I also want to thank Internet Studio Isser and Photographer Christian Trummer for the kind support in the development of the design update and the J.UCS images.
 In this first issue of the year, I also want to look back on the journal’s achievements in 2020. We are proud to report a total of 11 issues with 74 articles on novel aspects of various topics in computer science; to be more specific, 51 articles have been published in 7 special issues and 23 articles in 4 regular issues. Since last year, J.UCS publishes under the open access Creative Commons License CC BY-ND 4.0 and therefore provides even more value und openness to a broader community. In 2020, we counted more than 87 thousand unique visits and almost 65 thousand paper downloads. This success is only possible due to the great support of the involved institutions, reviewers and authors, and I want to gratefully thank them all for their valuable support and work. Over the years we have not only offered readers open access to our high-quality journal, but we also do not charge our authors publication fees. This adventurous approach together with a rigorous review process and a broad support by the community resulted in a valuable contribution in the field of computer science, which is reflected in the high number of unique visitors and article downloads. In this context I gratefully thank all consortium members for their financial support of J.UCS.
 I am looking forward to continuing the cooperation with our editors, the editorial team and the technical support to maintain the success of J.UCS. I would be very grateful for suggestions and feedback on how we can even improve and develop J.UCS in the future.
 In this regular issue, I am very pleased to introduce 3 accepted papers from 5 different countries.
 On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the J.UCS journal, Nelson Baloian, José A. Pino, Gustavo Zurita, Valeria Lobos-Ossandón, and Hermann Maurer analyze and discuss a bibliometric overview of the first 25 years of the journal in their collaboration between Austria and Chile. In a collaborative research between China and Spain, Xin Liu, Xiaoying Song, Wei Gao, Li Zou, and Alvaro Labella Romero report on their decision making approach based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic-valued credibility reasoning. And finally, Christian Moreira Matos, Vitor Kehl Matter, Marcio Garcia Martins, Joao Elison Da Rosa Tavares, Alexandre Sturmer Wolf, Paulo Cesar Buttenbender, and Jorge Luis Victoria Barbosa from Brazil discuss a collaborative model to assist people with disabilities and the elderly people in smart assistive cities.

Each industry has both common problems and its own specifics. This paper examines the specifics of the education sector (higher education in Ukraine) in the field of information technology. In particular, the influence of distance learning on job search and possible change of priorities that may have arisen during distance learning and distance communication with classmates is studied. The research is based on a survey of 3rd year computer science students at NU LP. The survey contains 15 questions, grouped into three subgroups: subjective feeling of the learning process, subjective feeling of choosing a profession, subjective feeling of Internet security. The survey was conducted in the target group of the most active part of society. The answers in the study group show the level of student satisfaction with the learning process and confidence in the quality of learning. Answers in the group: employment indicates the level of how the market sees the prospects of studying in the specialty of computer science. Answers in the group cyber security The attitude of young people (computer science students) to the provision of cyber communication at the state level. No research has been conducted on the provision of the Internet at the university level. The results of the work are visualized and presented both in graphs and in absolute and relative values. The study can assess the level of resilience of computer science specialties to the problems caused by the pandemic, including distance learning and distance work in IT firms. To enhance the results, the dynamics of recruitment of applicants over several years was analyzed. In the report for 2021, we see that the number of freshmen has increased in ICNI, this year received 1,130 students. 100% of the surveyed students who worked during the pandemic in the private IT sector of information technology worked remotely and received a full salary, which also shows the resistance of the specialty to the challenges of the pandemic (this mode reduces risks and the spread of risks).","Cybersecurity: Education, Science, Technique",2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.28925/2663-4023.2021.13.102112', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.28925/2663-4023.2021.13.102112?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.28925/2663-4023.2021.13.102112, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2ef832512db20d10928f2cc9b5c3d71ee64460bd,Teacher's Digital Competencies. A Systematic Review in the Latin-American Context,"Currently, more than 290 million students in the world are not attending classes due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19. In this sense, many educational centers have adapted classroom teaching to a non-classroom setting in response to the crisis. However, the change of modality from face-to-face to virtual education cannot suppose only a decision in which it is intended to replace the first one using some computer tools as video conferences. With this preamble, the need to systematically map digital competencies in Latin American higher education teachers raises since there are no records of the status of teacher's digital competencies in this part of the world before the pandemic. Therefore, this work examines the scientific literature published in the Web of Science, Scopus, ACM, IEEE, and Science Direct databases from 2004 until 2019. The Kitchenham method applied for the systematic mapping allowed determining quantitative and qualitative results such as year of publication and documentary sources with the most significant number of papers. The main contribution of this research is the areas found of teachers' digital skills that are considered relevant in the Latin American context and its differences with other models. Finally, a discussion of the results and conclusions serves as a starting point for future research in other geographic areas and preliminary information to determine teachers' training needs to face the crisis. © 2021.

This systematic review aimed to systematically summarize studies obtained through a database search and examine the effect of web-based intervention programs on self-management and symptom management in patients with lymphoma.


METHODS
A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was carried out. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct, and Ovid databases were reviewed until January 2021. The flow chart of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis checklist was used in the search procedure without setting a year limit. Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study criteria were determined by two independent investigators and published randomized controlled studies in English with lymphoma diagnosis and web-based intervention programs for self-management and symptom management were included in the systematic review. The included studies were examined for their risk of bias with the help of the Cochrane Collaboration tool. A narrative synthesis of study findings was performed.


RESULTS
Six randomized controlled trials with 2382 participants were included in the systematic review. Web-based intervention programs in patients diagnosed with lymphoma were found to be generally implemented for determining the levels of self-management and symptom management. In all of the studies reviewed, it was found that the interventions had treatment outcomes. The risk of Bias 2 was evaluated as high risk in two studies that did not meet the criteria for blinding outcome evaluations. The included studies, while evaluating the effects of web-based intervention programs on patient outcomes, could not provide information about the underlying mechanisms by which these effects occur and how they occur.


CONCLUSIONS
All of the studies included were found to apply a technology designed to improve outcomes in patients with lymphoma. It is recommended that web-based intervention programs be individualized by adapting them to lymphoma types and stages, and serve as a guide for effective symptom management.",Japan Journal of Nursing Science,2021.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/jjns.12460?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/jjns.12460, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

162ebb9051c7aefc4bfdec8489aeda63e543ea97,"Genome Profiling of SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia, ASEAN and the Neighbouring East Asian Countries: Features, Challenges and Achievements","A year after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, much has been learned with respect to SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, vaccine production and disease treatment. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has played a significant role in contributing to our understanding of the epidemiology and biology of this virus. In this paper, we investigate the use of SARS-CoV-2 WGS in Southeast and East Asia and the impact of technological development, access to resources, and demography of individual countries on its uptake. Facilitated by the Nottingham-Indonesia Collaboration for Clinical Research and Training (NICCRAT) initiative, we showcased a bilateral collaboration between the University of Nottingham and the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI/Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia) to establish WGS of SARS-CoV-2 using Oxford Nanopore Technology® (ONT) in Indonesia. Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited on GISAID from Southeast and East Asian countries reveals the importance of collecting clinical and demographic metadata and the importance of open access and data sharing. Lineage and phylogenetic analyses per 1 June 2021 found that: 1) B.1.466.2 variants were the most predominant in Indonesia, with mutations in the spike protein including D614G at 100%, N439K at 99.1%, and P681R at 69.7% frequency, 2) The variants of concern (VoCs), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) were first detected in Indonesia in January 2021, 2) B.1.470 was first detected in Indonesia and spread to the neighbouring regions, and 3) The highest rate of virus transmissions between Indonesia and the rest of the world appears to be through interactions with Singapore and Japan, two neighbouring countries with high degree of access and travels to and from Indonesia.

2a49ab6c8fe876d5d8b3d99eb8d53ed8ef84ae17,COVID-19 pandemic and disaster preparedness in the context of public health laws and policies,"Background: The Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP), 2004 addresses disaster preparedness, disease surveillance, disease data to respond to epidemics. The 12th Five Year Plan envisages disease surveillance for district-level laboratories and epidemic-centric diagnostic centers in consultation with the National Informatics Centers (NIC) and Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).
Objectives: These health policies need a critical appraisal in the COVID-19 pandemic and disaster preparedness in India’s system. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) pandemic cum disaster mitigation strategy analysed from risk mitigation to public health emergency in disaster management. The three-tier network labs and diagnostic centers, disease surveillance and disaster preparedness examined critically in the context of Disaster Management Act (DMA), 2005.
Methodology: The methodology of the study derives from European disaster management response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) India Chapter and National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) disaster management strategies utilized as model for the epidemic and pandemic control. The SIR epidemiological model for the COVID-19 mortality applied in the emergency paradigm of health care system in COVID-19 pandemic.
Results: COVID-19 pandemic and disaster preparedness in India revolves around the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 and Epidemic Diseases Act (EDA), 1897 Disaster Management Act (DMA), 2005, and Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020. The sordid and wise experiences for the Disaster Management and COVID-19 pandemic culminate into 5 Ps Disaster Management adopted by India.5 It spells out the proof of concept with social experiment, proactive approach, people management, partnership, preparation, and collaboration.
Conclusion: The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) assumes a pivotal role in controlling the infection and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic under the WHO Guideline of the disaster management cycle having a multi-component approach. The COVID-19 pandemic and disaster preparedness in India’s health system moved from risk mitigation to public health emergency in disaster management.

42cfbf1e68f0db6802fb1944506b004d269073da,Integrating the Use of Statistical Software into Undergraduate Political Methodology Courses,"It is widely recognized that statistical, programming, data science, and analytic skills give students a strategic advantage on the job market and in their future career. The American Statistical Association predicted that by 2021, 70% of business leaders will prefer candidates with data science skills.1 This demand is expected to keep growing, with projections of 28% growth during the last five years.2 Jobs that require coding skills pay, on average, $22,000 more per year than those that do not, and almost half of all jobs payingmore than $58,000 require at least some level of coding.3 In acknowledgment of this trend, higher education has added degrees, programs, and courses in data science and emphasized a greater need for data literacy among students.4 Students also are recognizing the utility of these skills because they now are often requirements for jobs beyond the business or physical science world, including education, healthcare, nonprofits, and even the wine industry.5 Yet, for our discipline, teaching undergraduate political methodology courses remains a demanding task; faculty must instruct students to bewriters, readers, and creators of political knowledge.6 Although these courses have existed for decades, the growing emphasis on data analysis and data literacy places a greater demand on research methods courses to deliver these skills. To further complicate the situation, there is little common discussion among political scientists regarding the use of data software, skills, and approaches in these courses. As a discipline, although we recognize the growing need for greater data literacy among undergraduate students, we appear to have placed little emphasis on this trend in our own pedagogical discussions. The criticism that research methodology lacks a strong pedagogical founding is not new. Previous studies recognize a dearth of discussion on the subject, despite acknowledging that methods courses often are some of the most academically challenging for students (Howard and Brady 2015). For instance, Wagner, Garner, and Kawulich (2011, 75) stated that research methods instructors “appear not to cover pedagogical questions at all.” This does not mean that discussions of pedagogy in social science and political science methodology are nonexistent (c.f. Hubbell 1994; Nind, Kilburn, and Luff 2015; Payne and Williams 2011). However, the fact remains that there is little guidance for undergraduate political methodology instructors. As more students recognize the benefits of these courses, a deeper understanding of best practices in pedagogical approaches is urgently needed. This article fills this void by addressing two questions: (1) How is statistical software incorporated into undergraduate political methodology courses?; and (2) How are these courses structured and taught? We answer these questions through two distinct approaches. First, a team of research assistants collected and coded course information from 93 syllabi from 78 separate institutions (some had two or more syllabi included) of undergraduate political methodology courses drawn from a cross section of institutions according to their rank in the US News & World Report (Brown, Bryant, and Philips 2021). Of the 93 syllabi, 25 were from the South, 24 from the North, 9 from the East, and 35 from the West. Second, we relied on an anonymous survey conducted in January 2021—advertised on both the PolMeth email listserv and the “Political Scientists” private group page on Facebook —of instructors who have taught a political methodology course at the undergraduate level. We received more than 140 responses, from a mix of R1 (53% of respondents), R2 (11%), and R3 institutions (9%), as well as liberal arts (26%) and community colleges (0.7%). Using these two original data sources, we provide a broad overview of the “state of the discipline” regarding not only how statistical software is incorporated into political methodology courses but also how it is presented to students. We conclude with advice for instructors of these courses.",PS: Political Science & Politics,2021.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/S1049096521001177?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096521001177, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The main features on publication years, journals, countries and institutions, authors, keywords, and content types of the 100 most-cited articles on e-waste had been unfolded in this research. The direction and way forward were illustrated, the trends to date were demonstrated, and the terrain and pathways were evaluated on the research of e-waste. Bibliometric analysis method was applied to analyze various attributes on the 100 most-cited articles which were retrieved from WoSCC on May 25, 2021, by utilizing the software tools Microsoft Excel 2016 and VOS viewer 1.6.9. The publication year and citation number of the 100 articles ranged between 2003 and 2017 and from 83 to 925, respectively. Environmental Science & Technology (n=17) published the maximum articles. Waste Management, Journal of Hazardous Materials, and Environmental Science & Technology were the core journals on e-waste. One hundred twenty-three institutions and 25 countries were involved in publishing the 100 articles. Three hundred seventy authors contributed to the 100 articles in total. A total of 267 keywords occurred in the 100 articles. The keywords “e-waste” and “recycling” held the highest occurrences. The study content of the 100 articles could be classified into four types including the characteristic-and-property type, the environment-and-health type, the management-and-economic type, and the technique-and-processing type. Overall completeness and applicability of the evidence found in this study were verified sufficiently; the potential biases in the review process were also considered. The innovations of the research from the past bibliometric analysis work on e-waste were stated, and the implication for practice and research of this study were explained as well. 2007, 2008, and 2009 were a peak of the researches on e-waste, while the recent years were experiencing a valley. China and its institutions were most influential in this field on e-waste. India was becoming more and more influential on e-waste research in the world. Nigeria was the research center in Africa, and Brazil was the research center in Latin America. Wong Minghung was the most important expert on e-waste. The impact on environment and human being’s health was the hot topic of researches on e-waste; the characteristic and property of e-waste were studied not enough. The researches of technique and processing would be the direction and way forward in the study field on e-waste. The characteristic and property on e-waste would need more attention to be researched.

f4a93015a13bf333c99dd819316073eb20673d5f,Hajj Pilgrimage amidst covid-19 pandemic: a review,"Hajj pilgrimage is a nobligation for every Muslim that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime. Every year, more than 3 million pilgrims from over 180 countries travel to worship within a confined area of twelve kilometres in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The host country and participating countries need to institute effective measures for a safer and healthier Hajj pilgrimage. In the immediate Hajj season during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of pilgrims need to be reduced to the optimum number that can be managed individual countries’ Hajj missions. Beside proof COVID-19 clearance before travelling and completed Covid-19 vaccination, the stay in KSA should be shortened for Hajj ritual only. The participating countries responsible to thoroughly select individuals with low risk of severe infections, provide health education program, offer all compulsory and recommended vaccines and allocate adequate healthcare/isolation centres in KSA. The participating countries are also liable to prepare adequate quarantine places for hajj pilgrims when returning home. Individual pilgrims are responsible to prevent respiratory pathogens from spreading. Prior to departure for Hajj, they need to undergo a thorough medical examination, received all compulsory and recommended vaccines and follow health education program. During Hajj, they need to follow instructions by Hajj authorities, practicing proper hygiene, wearing a face mask and avoid crowded places. They also need to report to countries’ Hajj mission healthcare if having any fever or respiratory syndromes. With adequate measures prior, during and post-Hajj, we hope health security risk during the next Hajj seasons will be minimized.

In recent days the prevalence of addiction to social media among students is a serious issue. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of social media on the academic life and performance of high school students in Saudi schools, in Eastern Province Saudi Arabia. This was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study conducted in a Saudi school over 3 months (Nov 2020 Jan 2021), where 203 high school students were participated in the study. Data collected from the questionnaire included the academic performance in terms of school marks, the duration of social media use, time spend for studying, and social media addiction. Data analysis was performed using a statistical package for social science version 26 (SPSS) was used.  Most of the participants were male students 131 (64%) and half of them 82 (40.4%) were in their academic second year. The mean time spent by students studying in a week was 18.50(M=18.50, SD = 8.33), while 3.79 mean hours per day were spent by students to use social media (M= 3.79, SD=2.65). A large majority of the participants using WhatsApp 191(94%) followed by snap chat 176 (86.7%).  About 171 (84.2%) agreed that the time spend on social networks takes up their time for studying. Based on Internet distraction, 81.3% of the participants agreed that social network is the main reason for their distraction in studies. The time spend on studying per week were significantly associated with gender (P= 0.0001), age (P= 0.0001). Also there was significant difference between male and female in the final exam scoring (P= 0.0001). The results found that the use of social media among Saudi school students’ found high.

5dc33134420a218922c8eb52a26f9b9bebfbfd41,"On COVID-19, cognitive bias, and open access","Starting out the year 2021 by looking back at the year 2020 might seem like an exercise in masochism, given the horrific loss of life, the untold economic hardships, the resurgence of white supremacy across the country, and the rampant (and at times utterly incomprehensible) political chaos packed into those 12 months. There were, however, many redeeming aspects of the year, not least of which was a panoply of breathtaking scientific achievements. The development of not just one but several remarkably effective vaccines against COVID-19, a hitherto completely unknown virus, in less than 12 months was unprecedented (and was among the reasons Oxford Languages chose “unprecedented” as one of its choices for “word of the year,” https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/). But even beyond assembling, with astonishing rapidity, the body of knowledge required for successful vaccine development, the scientific community across a broad span of disciplines continued to discover and innovate with inspiring resilience. Like so many other journals, PNAS experienced a surge in manuscript submissions—an increase of about 20% for the year, in fact, resulting in the publication of more than 3,600 research articles this year, compared with ∼3,250 last year. It should surprise no one that, of the 30 most highly cited of the 3,600+ published papers, 90% were COVID-related. The 10% of highly cited papers that were unrelated to COVID-19, however, represented major advances on other critical fronts. Two studies (1, 2) addressed climate change, a more slowmoving existential threat to human existence that was clearly not forgotten during the pandemic. Also remaining a high priority was an aspect of racial and economic injustice that strikes at the core of the scientific enterprise, with one paper (3) reporting the results of a study aimed at narrowing achievement gaps in underrepresented minority undergraduates in STEM fields. COVID-19, however, brought with it a seismic shift in the national research profile. At PNAS, we began by closely monitoring COVID-19 manuscripts as of March 6, 2020, in an effort to expedite processing while maintaining quality. Most striking about the submissions was the diversity of disciplines they represented; researchers across the physical, biological, and social sciences pivoted to deploy their specific disciplinary skills to shed light on different dimensions of the pandemic. One study was unexpectedly illuminating for me, in a context broader than just surviving this particular pandemic. Published on June 24, Lammers et al. (4) reported the results of three studies conducted in late March 2020 showing that there existed a widespread misperception that cases of COVID-19 were increasing in a linear, rather than an exponential, fashion; moreover, that misperception was a critical factor contributing to failures to embrace social distancing to stem the spread. Underestimating the threat posed by the epidemic is a manifestation of what has been called exponential growth bias, a phenomenon described decades ago and known for its remarkable robustness, despite its potential to cause Fig.1.

He improved immensely without complications and was discharged from the hospital on 28/4/2021 following a 14-day hospital stay on rivaroxamine 10 mg daily, vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc. The cavernous sinus (CS) is a pair of cerebral dural venous sinuses found in the middle cranial fossa on each side of the sellaturcica. The cavernous sinus contains the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves, as well as the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the fifth cranial nerve and the internal carotid artery with its surrounding sympathetic plexus.

Introduction The world is facing the second wave of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which is the most troublesome challenge to public health. COVID19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV2) started in Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China in December 2019 [1] . The virus has since spread globally rapidly and World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 pandemic on 11th March 2020. The second wave is running and nobody knows where we are in the course of this disease. It becomes a significant challenge for the public health, science, and medical sectors [2] . COVID-19 is primarily the disease of respiratory tract and initially the mortalityis related to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but more and more understanding of this disease in course of time, it revealed that COVID-19caused an inflammatory response with severe systemic complications like stroke, acute liver failure and acute renal failure [3] . Neurologic complications are frequent in patients with COVID-19, occurring in 36% to 65% of hospitalized patients [4, 5] .

de2285451521229455d3d9e3e72f7eb8aba02ef7,Silent Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Ethiopia: Longitudinal Cohort Study Among Frontline Healthcare Workers and Community,"Background: Over a year since the first reported case, COVID-19 burden in Ethiopia remains unknown due to limited surveillance. We aimed to investigate seroepidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 among frontline healthcare workers (HCW) and communities in Ethiopia. 
 
Methods: We conducted a population-based, prospective, longitudinal cohort study involving HCW, urban residents, and rural communities in Jimma and Addis Ababa. Serology was performed with Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid assay (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) in three consecutive rounds with a mean interval of six weeks between tests to obtain seroprevalence and incidence estimates within the cohorts. 
 
Findings: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among HCW increased dramatically during the study period: in Addis Ababa from 10·9% (95% Credible Interval: 8·3%; 13·8%) in August 2020 to 53·7% (44·8; 62·5) in February 2021, incidence rate 2,223 (1,785; 2,696) per 100,000 person-weeks; in Jimma from 30·8% (26·9; 34·8) in November 2020 to 56·1% (51·1; 61·1) in February 2021, incidence rate 3,810 (3,149; 4,540) per 100,000 person-weeks. Among urban communities, an almost 40% increase in seroprevalence was observed in early 2021, with incidence rates of 1,622 (1,004; 2,429) in Jimma and 4,646 (2,797; 7,255) per 100,000 person-weeks in Addis Ababa.  Seroprevalence in rural communities increased from 18·0% (13·5, 23·2) in November 2020 to 31·0% (22·3, 40·3) in March 2021. 
 
Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 spread in Ethiopia has been highly dynamic among HCW and urban communities. It can be speculated that the greatest wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections is currently evolving in rural Ethiopia and thus requires focused attention in respect to healthcare burden and disease prevention.

8b5fb89bf8b8c5e46ac5ddc3de6d94e5dab7a4a0,Aligning digital literacy and student academic success: Lessons learned from COVID-19 pandemic,"In this paper the alignment of computer and digital literacy as well as student academic success were examined. Lack of adequate functional digital literacy training and the unreadiness of higher education institutions for the impact of random shocks such as COVID-19 pandemic has gravely affected teaching and learning. The purpose of this paper is to make the case for preparedness of students to meet the needs of technology jobs by mandating and aligning digital literacy and student success. As COVID-19 Pandemic was spreading through the communities of the United States, institutions of higher education transitioned to fully online teaching and learning. Prior to the pandemic, fully online education was secondary to face-to-face format. Only about 20% of classes were fully online while 80% were face-to-face. Digital literacy was given a token treatment as a percentage of the entire curriculum and relegated to only the departments of computer information systems and computer sciences. Faculty, students, staff, families, and communities were not trained for the intensity of fully online education as the only format. Many of them never heard of most of the digital literacy tools. Both faculty and students were forced to learn the use of computers and digital literacy tools to survive the spring 2020 semester. Low-income families were left to the operational schedules of local libraries, many of whom did not have internet presence. The institutions provided limited training for faculty and students to meet the urgency of the time. Faculty and students were forced to purchase expensive tools and hardware to withstand the intensive demand of teaching and learning. Many students were overwhelmed by the pressure of the new way of learning; some dropped out of school while many performed very poorly in their examinations which negatively impacted their overall grade point averages. One year later in spring 2021, the student success outcomes have barely changed. At the same time, technology is advancing despite the raging COVID pandemic. Millions of technology-enabled jobs remain unfilled while millions of university graduates are unemployed. There continues to be a mismatch between current job requirements in the industries and graduating students’ skills. This paper discusses the indispensable value of building computer and digital literacy training into all undergraduate curriculums. We argue for mandated computer and digital literacy exit skills assessment test for all graduating students irrespective of their discipline. We also make the case for increased institutional investment in faculty training in computer and digital literacy readiness. There are a number of remedies suggested to address the speed of advancement in technology, faculty and student functional mastery of basic computer and digital literacy skills.

56bd525ca27facafb8875b0805e5acf5c3269c4d,Moving Classes in a Large Programming Course Online: An Experience Report,"We present an experience report on moving face-to-face classes in a large CS1 course to an online format, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The course is based on the flipped classroom approach and team-based learning. Students prepare for classes by reading specific chapters of the textbook and/or by watching pre-recorded videos. The classes are synchronous, in which students take quizzes and work on programming assignments in teams, with the guidance of tutors. To evaluate the implementation, we compared the results from surveys and exams between 2019 and 2020. The results show that students were at least as satisfied with the online classes in 2020 in comparison with face-to-face classes from the previous year, and generally satisfied with the organization of the course and the learning experience. Moreover, we found no discernible change in the grades on the midterm exams and the final exam between the two years. In the future, we might allow the students to choose the class format that best fits their individual needs. © Hrafn Loftsson and Ásrún Matthíasdóttir;licensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0 Second International Computer Programming Education Conference (ICPEC 2021).",International Computer Programming Education Conference,2021.0,5,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4230/OASIcs.ICPEC.2021.2?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4230/OASIcs.ICPEC.2021.2, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

546effc8e692cdae40cfa059d307718b88f87f9e,Assessment of Air Pollution around Durra Refinery (Baghdad) from Emission NO2 Gas at April Monthof Air Pollution around Durra Refinery (Baghdad) from Emission NO2 Gas at April Month,"Nitrogen dioxide NO2 is one of the most dangerous contaminant in the air, its toxic gas that cause disturbing respiratory effects, most of it emitted from industrial sources especially from the stack of power plants and oil refineries. In this study Gaussian equations modelled by Matlab program to state the effect of pollutant NO2 gas on area around Durra refinery, this program also evaluate some elements such as wind and stability and its effect on stacks height. Data used in this study is the amount of fuel oil and fuel gas burn inside refinery at a year 2017. Hourly April month data chosen as a case study because it’s unsteady month. After evaluate emission rate of the all fuel and calculate exit velocity from stack (consider all refinery unit is a point), effective height resulted. Effective height is test with other atmospheric element and with stability, and there is direct relation with unstable turner classes. After Gaussian model implemented results show that most pollutant area from pollutant of NO2 is Al-Jadriyah and Al-Karada area, this area is about 3-5 kilometer from the refinery point. The wind direction domain is from the south to south-east, thus most flow is to north, north-west and the pollutant level of NO2 is over the national ambient air quality standard in this area. Keyword: NO2 concentration, stability, air pollution, April month, emission rate. Introduction: Power generation plants and refinery produce varying emissions to the surrounding atmosphere that may adversely impact air quality and cause air pollution in the vicinity regions . Through Combustion of fossil fuels atmospheric nitrogen and any nitrogen in the fuel will converts into its oxides, mainly nitric oxide (NO) and with small amounts (5–10%) of NO2. NO slowly oxidizes to NO2 in the atmosphere . Nitrogen oxides, NOx are the term used to describe the sum of NO, NO2 and other oxides of nitrogen; all these play a major role in the formation of ozone, particulate matter, and acid rain. Long-term exposures to NO2 may lead to increase susceptibility to respiratory infection and may cause permanent alterations in the lung . Usually NO2 in the atmosphere comes from two sources, either directly from emission sources (primary pollutant) or from chemical reactions in the atmosphere . Nitrogen monoxide (NO), in turn, is converted to NO2 by reactions with proxy radicals (RO2) or O3. Nitrogen dioxide is then photolysis in the atmosphere, and the released atomic oxygen combines with molecule O2 to form O3, This gas considers one of gases emitted from flues . Flow rate of Emissions are necessary to determine transfer Contaminants, Where Know the source location will allow us to calculate concentration at a particular region using dispersion model . Inhalation of NO2 by children increases their risk of respiratory infection and may lead to poorer lung function in later life. Recent epidemiological studies have shown an association between ambient NO2 exposure and increases in daily mortality and hospital admissions for respiratory disease. NO2 has also been shown to potentiate the effects of exposure to other known irritants, such as ozone and respirable particles . Animal and human experimental studies indicate that NO2 at short-term concentrations exceeding 200μg/m (one hour) is a toxic gas with significant health effects. Animal toxicological studies also suggest that long-term exposure to NO2 at concentrations above current ambient concentrations has adverse effects . In this study Assessments the effect of the effective rise of Open Access Baghdad Science Journal P-ISSN: 2078-8665 Published Online First: November 2021 2022, 19(3): 515-527 E-ISSN: 2411-7986 516 flue on the pollutant resulted from nitrogen oxides emitted from fuel oil and fuel gas combustion in the regions near to refinery for April month that consider as moderate condition month. The study was focus on the factors affecting the pollutant NO2 concentration gas overall. For this purpose the program has built up for simulated arithmetic algorithms, also for precision and ease in the use of equations considered. Site Durra Refinery is the main refinery of Ministry of oil Midland Refineries Company (MRC) in Iraq. It is located on the western side of the Tigris River and south-west of Baghdad city, about few kilometers from the city center, it is flat ground. Refinery has Dimensions length 1620 m and width of 860m. From east bounded with small liquid gas filling plant, and the Imam Hassan neighborhood, also from the west and south-west the university district, the residence of employer’s borders of the refinery. The highway is located on the east, south-east and south sides. Finally, on the northern side, a small flat area extends across the Tigris River; consider one of the largest cities in Baghdad province known as Karada 9 Fig. 1. When refinery builds in 1960 it’s located outside the Baghdad city but the large urban expansion will made the refinery inside the Baghdad city. Figure 1.

4887e061ee22ac93caacc3f820f9b14e70121b30,The Role of the Council of Europe in the International Cooperation between Russian and European Forensic Organizations,"The globalization processes in Europe have allowed international crime to become more global and diversified. The appliance of various forms of forensic knowledge and expertise plays an essential role in current judicial proceedings. Among multiple European cooperation formats, the Council of Europe holds a special place as an international organization that promotes cooperation among its members in standards of the rule of law, human rights, democratic development, and cultural interaction. The year 2021 marks a quarter of a century since the Russian Federation’s participation in the Council of Europe. The authors perceive this date’s significance through the interaction of Russian and European forensic organizations within the framework of the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI). It was Russia’s membership in the Council of Europe that allowed the lead forensic institutions of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Justice to join ENFSI and actively participate in its work for many years. The article observes the chronology of the key ENFSI events highlighting its evolvement as the lead pan-European forensic expert organization, the basic principles of which were predetermined by the Council of Europe. As an illustrative example of previous cooperation in solving challenging expert problems is proposed the international program initiated by the Russian party and implemented by ENFSI in 2005–2008 to validate complex methods to identify the products containing platinum group metals produced by mining and metallurgical companies. Subsequently, the consolidated position of European and Russian forensic experts at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum venue in 2013–2015 served as a powerful impetus for practical development of standardization and accreditation issues in forensic science in Russia. Current problematics of cooperation is mainly devoted to the issues of ensuring the quality of forensic examination, reliability of its conclusions, consolidation of expert databases. The authors also note some interaction problems between forensic organizations resulting from different legal systems, cultural traditions, and scientific schools.",Theory and Practice of Forensic Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.tipse.ru/jour/article/download/648/563', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30764/1819-2785-2021-1-59-68?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30764/1819-2785-2021-1-59-68, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

448292ff7af7ddbe75d13144bf03dbbbd01a39d6,"Providing Support to High School STEM Teachers at Underrepresented Schools Through a Yearlong Professional Development Initiative (WIP, Diversity)","In addition to being an employment requirement for in-service high school educators, professional development (PD) workshops in STEM fields are vital for keeping up with new innovations in both theory and practice. Integrating cross-cutting engineering concepts into a PD STEM program provides a unique opportunity for both teachers and students. Students gain a deeper understanding of individual concepts and the relationship among the components of STEM. Teachers benefit from demonstration of how this integration of concepts can be practically carried out in their classrooms. The goals of the PD institute were to 1) integrate industrial technology, engineering technology and computer science constructs into core math and science high school curriculum (Physical Science, Biology, Chemistry and Physics);2) advance teacher knowledge in the core science subjects with emphasis on misconceptions;3) introduce/reinforce the engineering design process;and 4) due to COVID-19 constraints, to introduce teachers to online simulation platforms for at-home and in-class discovery of scientific concepts. Delivered as a six-day workshop in Summer 2020, the PD institute continued throughout the school year to offer continued support and form a Professional Learning Community (PLC). Due to restrictions from COVID-19, the entire workshop was delivered virtually and instruction was offered to assist with remote delivery of classes and science labs in the upcoming school year. The program covers multidisciplinary engineering science and education technology topics including misconceptions in physical science, misconceptions in biological science, visual programming, CAD and 3D printing, electrical circuit simulation, and overview of online teaching technologies. In addition to instruction and continuing education credit, the teachers received classroom materials to support them in delivering these STEM contents in their schools including a 3D printer for each participating school. This paper represents the current work in progress as part of a comprehensive initiative, which also includes a ten-day summer program for high school students, to serve diverse students and educators from underrepresented communities. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37621.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37621?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37621, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

745709a42e49315288ff8f35b950f7ec28d477fe,Predicted Cancer Risk Probability using Linear and Nonlinear Regression Models with Medical Condition Inputs from Chronic Diseases and Lifestyle Details Collected Data of a Type 2 Diabetes Patient Based on GH-Method: Math- Physical Medicine (No. 550),"The author has spent approximately 40,000 hours over the past 12 years self- studying and researching internal medicine branches, with a focus on endocrinology and diabetes. Since 2018, he has expanded his interest, learning and research work into other medical branches related to lifestyle, metabolism and immunity. Currently, his type 2 diabetes (T2D) is well under control, where the HbA1C level decreased from 10% in 2010 down to 5.8% in 2021 without medication intervention. Naturally, he is concerned about other life-threatening diseases of the elderly population, specifically cancers and dementia. Over the past decade, he has written and published more than 540 medical papers in various medical journals. In total, he applied about 30 different research methodologies based on his developed GH-method: math-physical medicine, including physics theories, engineering modeling, mathematical equations, computer science tools of big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as some traditional statistical approaches to explore and interpret various biomarkers and their biophysical phenomena. However, the majority of published medical research papers he has read to date are primarily based on statistics (~90% of his total reading volume of ~2,000 papers). In this particular article, he decides to follow the majority of other medical scientists’ footsteps, to use the traditional statistical regression model with linear and various nonlinear formulas involving multiple independent variables to investigate his overall risk probability of developing cancer versus 4 categories of metabolic disorder induced chronic diseases (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia) and 6 categories of lifestyle details (food, water, exercise, sleep, stress, and daily life routines). In this paper, he will not repeat the detailed introduction of the regression analysis models in the Methods section because it is available in many statistics text books. It should be noted that in regression analysis, the correlation coefficient R should be > 0.5 or 50% to indicate a strong inter-connectivity and the p-value should be < 0.05 or 5% to be considered as statistically significant. The author recently studied a consensus report published jointly by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) in 2010 regarding relationships between cancers and diabetes. Based on the information from this report plus ~3 million collected data of his own overall metabolism situation, including medical conditions and lifestyle details, he decided to conduct a research study regarding the estimation of his overall and relative risk probability of having cancer over two time periods: the longer 12-year period from 2010 to 2021 and the shorter 9-year period from 2013 to 2021. The reason for using two time-periods is due to his insufficient data gathering and guesstimateddata from 2010 and 2012. He would like to investigate the prediction difference. In summary, from the time-domain analysis, the two cancer risk waveforms, metabolism index (MI) based cancer risk curve and regression predicted cancer risk curve, are similar to each other in terms of shape similarity. They have an extremely high of 92% - 98% correlation between the curves and with a 100% prediction accuracy of averaged cancer risks.",Journal of Applied Material Science &amp; Engineering Research,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33140/jamser.05.04.11?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33140/jamser.05.04.11, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0ef9acf2396b35f71748cf5b71c9ad560161238e,Vladimir Gerdt dies at 73,"It is our deepest regret to inform you that Vladimir Petrovich Gerdt, Professor, Head of the Algebraic and Quantum Computing Group of the Scientific Department of Computational Physics of the Laboratory of Information Technologies (LIT) at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Oblast Moscow, Russia, died on January 5th, 2021 at the age of 73, following complications caused by COVID-19. Vladimir Gerdt was born on January 21, 1947 in the town of Engels, Saratov region of the USSR. He began his scientific activity at JINR in November 1971, after graduating from the Physics Department of Saratov State University, first in the Department of Radiation Safety, and from February 1977 on in the Laboratory of Computer Technology and Automation, which was renamed in the year 2000 to Laboratory of Information Technologies, where he was engaged in the deployment of analytical computing software systems on the computers of the JINR Central Research Center, their development and application for solving physical problems. Starting in 1983, he was the head of the Computer Algebra Research Group (renamed in 2007 to Algebraic and Quantum Computing Group) at LIT. In 1976, Vladimir Gerdt successfully defended his Ph.D. thesis (for Kandidat nauk/Kandidat nauk) in the field Theoretical and Mathematical Physics, and in 1992, his doctoral dissertation (for Doktor nauk/Doktor nauk, D.Sc.) in the field Application of Computer Technology, Mathematical Modeling, and Mathematical Methods for Scientific Research. In 1997, he was awarded the academic title of Professor. Vladimir Gerdt started his career with work on the integrability analysis of nonlinear evolution equations using symmetries, and he never ceased to be interested in symmetry methods for di↵erential equations. Later, the involution analysis of polynomial systems and systems of di↵erential or di↵erence equations became a core theme in his research. Together with some of his students, he developed the theory of involutive bases out of the Janet–Riquier theory. As one application of these results to physics, he was always interested in the study of systems with constraints, in particular in Dirac theory. Another application in recent years consisted of designing structure preserving numerical methods for partial di↵erential equations. In the last years, he also revived the Thomas decomposition for polynomial di↵erential equations and applied it to numerous problems. One of his last significant results was an algorithmic solution of the linearization problem for ordinary di↵erential equations. For many years, Vladimir Gerdt also worked in the field of quantum computing. His group at JINR developed methods and computer algebra programs for studying quantum information processes and for modeling quantum systems. In particular, they applied a combination of computational invariant theory and involutive bases to a qualitative and quantitative study of entangled quantum states. Vladimir Gerdt was the author or co-author of more than 240 scientific papers (a listing is available at his CV at JINR), and he was a leading expert in the field of symbolic and algebraic computation. He devoted a lot of e↵ort and energy to train young researchers in these modern scientific areas.

Neoplasms rarely arise from ESGT, let alone carcinoma expleomorphic adenoma (CEPA) which is a malignant tumour that arises from the epithelial component of pleomorphic adenoma. It usually occurs in the parotid gland and in lesser instances, from submandibular gland or minor salivary glands. Herein, we report a rare case of CEPA in right supraclavicular ESGT of a 67-year-old lady.She underwent complete surgical excision of the mass and is free from any recurrence to date. Brief review of pathogenesis, clinical features and treatment of ectopic CEPA are discussed. A thorough review of the English literature reveals that our patient may be the second case of ectopic CEPA in the neck region ever reported to date.

abe74b00c60cf2d09650bb75566ff66f7e864f7e,Coping and scholarship during a pandemic,"I began to write this editorial as global COVID-19 cases had risen for over nine consecutive weeks, and as regions around the globe were experiencing second and even third waves, with over 3 million deaths world-wide (WHO, 4 May 2021). As this issue of CSSE is going to press, cumulative deaths attributed to COVID-19 have now surpassed 4 million, with 3 million new cases having been reported globally this week alone (WHO, 13 July 2021). These are staggering statistics, hinting at some of the wide-ranging human and societal costs associated with the pandemic, with a disproportionate impact on those already experiencing inequalities (Pirtle 2020). The process of education has become centered around remote teaching, learning and working from home over the past year, with drastic and unplanned changes to educational systems impacting over 94% of the world’s student population (Pokhrell and Chettri 2021). Most of the international science education community has faced disruptions and upheavals due to COVID19. Our collective lives on campuses and in classrooms were abruptly halted, and many found themselves suddenly faced with the need to balance changing structures and roles both at home and at work. University learning quickly “went remote” and faculty focused on the time-consuming process of converting courses that were once taught in person into online formats. Shifting responsibilities and restructured time commitments coupled with the challenges of uncertainty ushered in profound implications for the educational research community. While coping with unexpected responsibilities and new personal and professional roles in response to the pandemic, research productivity was challenged, especially for early career scholars, doctoral students and scholars of color (Levine et al. 2021). Many academics struggled with increasing obligations, and with finding time and space for research and writing, and all this at a time of crisis. Female academics are particularly at risk (Peters 2020), with recent journal publication trends already showing a decrease in representation of women scholars since the start of the pandemic (e.g., Pinho-Gomes et al. 2020). This raises the possibility of a frightening lack of diversity in the voices that are heard in future research literature. With ideologies that emphasize individual attainment shaping education systems, and a pervasive underpinning assumption that “going remote” is a simple shift in modality for information delivery with little other implications, this is a time of great concern for",Cultural Studies of Science Education,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11422-021-10072-6.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8327894, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

By utilizing the right combination of resistant rootstock and scion, desired variability can be achieved to improve the yield and quality of vegetables. A study was conducted at the College orchard, Department of Vegetable science, Horticultural College and Research Institute, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore during the year 2020-2021 to evaluate the graft compatibility with two chilli rootstocks. The experimental material consisted of two perennial rootstocks viz., CC-CBE-001 and CF-CBE-007 and three scion materials viz., TNAU Chilli Hybrid CO 1, Ranga hybrid and Bangaram hybrid. Wedge grafting was done using 60 days old rootstock and 45 days old scion seedlings with nine treatments. The adhesion line wall thickness of pith cells were determined at different stages after grafting. The wound healing of the scion-rootstock union was studied using microscopic examination of the grafting region on the 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th day after grafting. It was observed that ten days after grafting, vascular bundle was formed and a large amount of callus was produced to bridge the scion and rootstock. Despite interspecific grafting, callus formation, subsequent cell differentiation and vascular connection were established, resulting in effective graft compatibility, according to the anatomical and histological analysis.",International Journal of Plant & Soil Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.9734/ijpss/2021/v33i2330722', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.9734/ijpss/2021/v33i2330722?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.9734/ijpss/2021/v33i2330722, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

710be4f60965e107814a8111b941fa309da1c537,"Religion, Climate Change, and Material Demand Reduction","The forthcoming COP26Meeting in Glasgow (1–12 November 2021) is again reminding us of the urgent significance of climate change. As with the pivotal Paris meeting in 2015 (COP21), the role of religion is also again in view. Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si’ was influential in galvanising international support for the Paris agreement, and newspaper reports now suggest that he might attend this year’s Scottish meeting in person. The influence of religious belief on how we view and treat the natural world has been in the spotlight at least since LynnWhite Jr’s much-cited 1967 paper in Science, in which he pointed the finger at Christian doctrine as a key driver of environmental degradation. His paper is not without its failings, but it would be impossible to deny that theology informs the destructive behaviour of some, just as it informs the impressive environmental advocacy of others. Faced with the need for still far greater environmental responsibility, the central place of “material demand reduction” in any such response has not received the attention it deserves. The point here is that materials such as steel or cement require a great deal of energy to produce or recycle. Any meaningful responses to climate change must take this into account. A recent report on the road to carbon neutrality (Absolute Zero, produced by the UK FIRES initiative) therefore makes the convincing case that transformation of manufacturing processes needs to sit prominently beside more familiar environmental responses, such as changes to how we travel, eat, and heat our buildings. Given that material demand reduction has not featured prominently in public discussion of climate change mitigation, neither has it yet entered to any great extent into theological discussion either. Nor, for that matter, have the resources that religious traditions might offer for a transformation of human practice in this regard been much considered. Sitting lightly to possessions, however, has been a common theme across the world’s religions, built upon the sense that human fulfilment does not lie in the accumulation of things. Renunciation, however, is not the only part of this story. I recall a conversation with the theologian and author Joan Chittister in which she described what I might call the piety, in her Benedictine tradition, towards the tools used in convent and monastery gardens, meaning that they were mended, not thrown away. More than frugality was at stake. The historical awareness of their shared religious life encouraged nuns and monks to receive these objects from their forebears with gratitude, as seasoned by good use. In turn, they wished to pass them on to future generations, mended rather than simply replaced. That anecdote reminds us that while a degree of simplicity is no doubt called for, other dynamics are also in play. Material demand reduction is as much about doing better, and more carefully, as it is about doing without. An important part of curbing climate change will be a shift to making and buying “Fewer, Better Things”, to borrow the title of Glenn Adamson’s compelling recent book. That, of course, is a challenge directed more to the affluent, who have enough, or more than enough, than to those for whom superfluity of",Theology and Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/14746700.2021.1944496?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/14746700.2021.1944496, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This tutoring initiative currently has four tutors. The student tutors range from sophomore to senior and are all Natural Science majors. The tutors have set tutoring dates and appointments available to meet with students. Most tutoring is one-on-one, but can also be in a group setting. After the meetings, students complete a survey. Preliminary results show 73 tutoring sessions in chemistry, biology, and physics courses. These courses tend to be the courses with the highest turn-over rate. Students tutored met the following demographics: female, first-generation, LGBTQ, minority, and male. Thus far the peer-tutoring program has been successful in reaching underrepresented students in STEM courses in the hope to increase the pass rate. Results of grade increase have not been assessed.",Proceedings of the West Virginia Academy of Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.55632/pwvas.v93i1.765', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.55632/pwvas.v93i1.765?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.55632/pwvas.v93i1.765, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is commonly associated with poor prognosis. A 51-year-old woman underwent a partial cystectomy for urachal cancer in 2014. She was well throughout follow-up with annual cystoscopies. She presented with a 1-month history of rapidly progressive suprapubic mass and hematuria. A contrasted computed tomography scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed a large mixed solid cystic tumour at the right lumbar region, suprapubic area and also at the pouch of Douglas. She refused surgical extirpation and now on chemotherapy. Urachal adenocarcinoma is rare, and resection is commonly advocated; usually, no standard adjuvant therapy is advocated. Recurrent cancers represent a management dilemma, and no standard follow-up protocols exist.

b9d559ac8020bded2dcdbd772259c87242bc42d2,Intermittent fasting: promising premises or broken promises?,"Over the last decade, intermittent fasting (better defined as “intermittent energy restriction”) has been considered of major interest as an alternative strategy to continuous caloric restriction for weight loss (Rynders et al. 2019). In fact, while dietary energy reduction (relatively to one’s energy requirements) may lead to a relative small effect on body weight (about 5–10% weight reduction over a year) with substantial weight regain once the caloric restriction is interrupted, an intermittent fasting approach has been supposed to improve the patient compliance by limiting the caloric restriction to certain days and allowing ad libitum feeding over the remaining weekly days (Rynders et al. 2019). The rationale for the enthusiasm regarding this potential strategy lies in the results of preclinical studies, in which it has been observed that fasting would induce sirtuin pathway and stimulate a metabolic adaptation towards weight loss (Madeo et al. 2019). However, the findings from clinical studies are not as striking as those from animal studies: recent meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials conducted on overweight/obese individuals showed that intermittent fasting would lead to similar results than continuous energy restriction, especially in the short term, with insufficient evidence to support its long-term effects (Harris, Hamilton, et al. 2018; Harris, McGarty, et al. 2018). In this issue of International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition, a systematic review from Sandoval et al provided an overview of studies conducted on trained or overweight individuals younger than 60 years old showing potential effects on body composition (i.e. decreasing fat mass and maintaining muscle mass) irrespective of body weight, as well as potential effects on biomarkers of metabolic health (including GLP-1, insulin, and glucose levels) (Sandoval et al. 2021). These findings are still limited by the design of the studies included (some observational) and the not univocal definitions for the intervention. Moreover, the long-term effects of such strategy are still to be elucidated, failing to result superior in patients’ compliance compared to other weightloss approaches. More acceptable forms of intermittent fasting have been proposed as alternatives, including the fasting-mimicking diet (characterised by a low caloric intake with a small contribution of carbohydrates and proteins and a high fat intake) (Sofi 2020) and the time restricted feeding (characterised by feeding time restricted to 8–10 h per day, with no real recommendation on energy intake) (Currenti et al. 2020). While both such approaches have been extensively discussed in review articles underlying strengths and limitations of current evidence (Hoddy et al. 2020; Fanti et al. 2021), our journal also published interesting original articles showing the potential for a time-restricted feeding approach in the context of Mediterranean populations, which could benefit from both diet quality and restricted eating window of time. Specifically, time-restricted eating was associated with better anthropometric profiles (Karras, Koufakis, Adamidou, Antonopoulou, et al. 2021; Karras, Koufakis, Adamidou, Polyzos, et al. 2021) and improved plasma levels of adiponectin (Karras, Koufakis, Adamidou, Dimakopoulos, et al. 2021) and vitamin D (Rodopaios et al. 2021) in Greek Ortodox older individuals. Similar observations have been reported by our research group on older Southern Italian adults, concerning better metabolic (Currenti, Buscemi, et al. 2021) and mental health status (Currenti, Godos, et al. 2021a; Currenti, Godos, et al. 2021b) in individuals eating within a restricted window of time (<10 h). Although not yet supported by clinical trials, we may hypothesise that the reasons for such significant findings might rely on the observation for such behaviour (reduced eating window of time) embedded within the context of the overall lifestyle, characterised by chronicity and longterm adoption, in good balance with moderate physical activity and adequate not excessive calorie intake. There is no further scientific evidence on this matter, and additional studies are needed to clarify such hypotheses. However, it is crucial to understand whether the effects obtained by intermittent fasting (as time restricted feeding or other approaches) are related to the caloric restriction, to physiological changes in body hormonal and gut microbial homeostasis, or whether, on the contrary, the desired effects cannot be reached until the intervention becomes a lifestyle.",International Journal of Food Science and Nutrition,2021.0,4,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09637486.2021.1967301?needAccess=true', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/09637486.2021.1967301?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/09637486.2021.1967301, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

db18bc728dcfa104ccc661b48919c10d6f1aef8c,Online Peer Teaching in Medical School during a Pandemic Period: A Reflection,"Peer-teaching has been rapidly adopted throughout higher education institutions, including medical schools, to provide students with a diverse learning environment and to enhance academic development. Peer assisted study session (PASS) is a peer-teaching program implemented in Monash University Malaysia and was conducted virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perspectives from the viewpoint of peer tutors during the pandemic period are presented in this paper. Throughout the year, peer tutors were confronted with the unique challenges of teaching virtually. Various factors which contribute to changes in the dynamics of group-based discussions in online classes are discussed. On online platforms, students are graced with more privacy and freedom, a double-edged sword that can translate into reduced student engagement. Nonetheless, the practical skills acquired by adapting to the abrupt switch from on-campus to online peer-teaching can be employed in our future practice as health professionals.

This conference was sponsored by ASEAN Universiti Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-NET) under the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Technical Cooperation Project. RCCE 2020 strategized to combine the transformation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) implementation in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) based on the requirements of United Nation for the year 2030 as well as to support the specific agenda in “The World in 2050” (TWI 2050). This aspiration was the global research and fact-based knowledge in transforming the indicated SDGs in a better way. Therefore, all the keynotes/ invited/ guest speakers explained their roles and contribution to the society, with SDGs related to R&D, innovation, technology and knowledge-transfer. Most of the issues and challenges were connected to the environmental application thereby strengthening the interaction between HEIs, Industry, Government and Community. As the world is still bound to the COVID-19 pandemic, travelling was restricted. For this, different parallel sessions were conducted virtually focusing on the theme “Localizing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Engineering with Look East Policy Partnership”. Participants around this region did not only share similar issues or problems faced but also forged strong partnership among the ASEAN countries to come out with viable solutions fitting this region. In line with the international publication requirements, manuscripts from sessions related to engineering field including structural, environmental, material science, green technology, geotechnical, transportation, water resources and wastewater were rigorously reviewed. We hope that the collection of accepted manuscript will provide insights to many academicians, researchers and specialist of particular field.

597f1fba11392847ff3df05f14cf2faf11f786e8,"Regional Epidemiology of Common Respiratory Viruses In Hangzhou, China: Did It Change after Global Pandemic of COVID-19?","Background: Respiratory infection poses a heavy burden to people and social health care. Adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and influenza B virus are common viruses that cause respiratory infections. The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) last year has had a significant impact and may have changed the prevalence situation of common respiratory viruses. 
 
Objective: To analyse the changes of common virus in respiratory infections before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hangzhou, China since October 2017. 
 
Methods: We analysed the clinical statistic about patients who visited outpatient and the inpatient department in Hangzhou Normal University affiliated hospital retrospectively from October 1, 2017 to February 28, 2021 and were simultaneously collected throat or nose swab for testing respiratory virus antigen (including influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus). The data concludes the number of samples, numbers of virus positive detection cases, patients' age, gender, etc. 
 
Results: A total of 121,529 samples were collected, including 78,085 samples aged 0-14 years and 39,637 samples aged 15 years and above. Among all the samples, 13200 cases(10·86%) were positive for influenza A virus(IFVA), 8402 cases(6·91%) were positive for influenza B virus(IFVB), 6056 cases (4·98%) were positive for adenovirus(ADV), and 4739 (3·90%) were positive for respiratory syncytial virus(RSV). The positive rate of each virus was higher in patients younger than 14 years than that in patients older than 14 years. The positive rate of IFVA and RSV had no significant difference in gender. For people aged 0-14 years, the positive rate of ADV in males was higher than that in females. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the infection rate of IFVA or IFVB decreased significantly, the infection rate of adenovirus decreased somewhat, and the infection rate of RSV was still high and it showed no significant changes in epidemic season of RSV. 
 
Conclusion: After the spread of COVID-19, the infection of influenza virus and ADV decreased probably due to wearing masks, popularization of vaccination, reduction of crowd gathering activities, improvement of air quality because of the reduction of industrial activities, et al. But the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus does not change significantly, maybe relating to it’s susceptible population. The epidemic characteristics of respiratory common virus are affected by virus type, age, season, sex and region.

As our university made the decision to operate primarily online for the 2020-2021 academic year in response to COVID-19, the ninefacilitator ISSUES-X team supported faculty and their online teaching by offering weekly synchronous open-house video conferences and providing a one-week summer institute. The institute focused on applying principles of How People Learn (NRC, 1999) to the online environment, and intentionally modeled these pedagogical practices. Practices included: online approaches and tools to developing rapport with students;asynchronous reading and assignments sandwiched around synchronous active learning exercises over video conferencing;office hours and other support outside of regular meeting times;and routines for metacognitive reflection. Our pre-existing FLC structure allowed us to support many faculty during a time of crisis, illustrating the value of FLCs as a normative practice in academia.

The selected papers were studied in terms of the institution name, study subject, total number of papers, study design, contribution rate of Iranian orthopedic surgeons each year, annual number of papers published by Iranians in five journals with the greatest impact factor, and in journals with an impact factor. Results: There were 463 eligible articles in the field of shoulder and elbow (17 per year); 89 (18%) were clinical trials, and 375 (82%) were retrospective studies. Fracture dislocations were the most common study subject (17%), 11 % related to shoulder and 6 % related to elbow. Among shoulder related articles, the most common study subjects were fracture dislocation (24%), brachial plexus (14%), rotator cuff (12%), and tumor (6%). In elbow related articles, the most common study subjects were fracture dislocations, tennis elbow, and cubital tunnel syndrome (23%, 21%, and 16%, respectively). Conclusion: Although the number of articles published by Iranians in the field of shoulder and elbow in PubMed has increased significantly in recent years, there is still a long way for Iran to become a science exporting country.",Journal of Research in Orthopedic Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.32598/jrosj.8.4.770.1', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32598/jrosj.8.4.770.1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32598/jrosj.8.4.770.1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1155aade062199b33b6060bd65b762b70cbb79d8,Preface to the special issue on the Yaponesia Genome Project,"© 2021 The Anthropological Society of Nippon We started the five-year ‘Yaponesia Genome Project’ in 2018. This project is one of those funded by a MEXT Grantin-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas. The project home page is at http://www.yaponesian.jp/index_e. php. I am leader of this project. Please also see the introduction of this project reported by the Yaponesian Genome Project Managing Group (2020) in the new journal iDarwin. There are six research groups in this project as follows (* indicates the principal investigator of each group). Group A01—study modern human genomes. Members: Naruya Saitou*, Ituro Inoue, Koichiro Yoshiura, Timothy A. Jinam, and Masatoshi Matsunami. Group A02—study ancient human genomes. Members: Ken-ichi Shinoda*, Noboru Adachi, Tsuneo Kakuda, Takehiro Sato, and Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama. Group A03—study animal and plant genomes. Members: Hitoshi Suzuki*, Ryuichi Masuda, Takeshi Itoh, and Toshinori Endo. Group B01—study archeological data. Members: Shin’ichiro Fujio*, Naoko Kinoshita, Akira Seike, Yasuhiro Yamada, and Tatsuhiko Hamada. Group B02—study linguistic data. Members: Mitsuaki Endo, Nobuko Kibe, Shigehisa Karimata, Hiroshi Nakagawa, and Shinjiro Kazama. Group B03—study new genome data. Members: Naoki Osada*, Yosuke Kawai, Akihiko Fujimoto, and Jun Gojobori. There are also two-year limited research groups A04 and B04 as follows. Group A04 members: Kosuke Hanada, Kazuyoshi Hosomichi, Tadashi Imanishi, Ryosuke Kimura, Ken Naito, Kazuhiro Nakayama, Jun Ohashi, Hiroki Oota, Yoichi Sato, Kazuhiro Satomura, and Yohey Terai. Group B04 members: Reiko Aso, Kyoko Funahashi, Yuka Hayashi, Masakado Kawata, Takumi Nishiuchi, and Masami Takenaka. Professor Hiroki Oota of The University of Tokyo, who is a member of Group A04, is also editor-in-chief of Anthropological Science. He kindly offered to publish a special issue of Anthropological Science on the Yaponesia Genome Project. I thus asked the principal investigators of the six research groups to contribute either a review or an original investigation of their research area to Anthropological Science. Group B01 declined to contribute an article; however, Professor Oota himself contributed one review article to this issue. Thus, there are six articles, four original investigations and two reviews, in this special issue as follows. Two review articles were contributed by Group B03 (Osada and Kawai) and by Group A04 (Koganebuchi and Oota). Osada and Kawai (2021) reviewed usage of genomewide SNP data for estimating human migrations to Yaponesia. Koganebuchi and Oota (2021) reviewed human paleogenomic studies in East Asia including Yaponesia. Although it is a review article, Osada and Kawai (2021) found a weak but significant genetic tie of Jomon people to ancient North Siberians through meta-analysis of publicly available datasets. Four original articles were contributed by Groups A01 and B03 (Jinam, Kawai, and Saitou), Group A02 (Adachi, Kanzawa-Kiriyama, Nara, Kakuda, Nishida, and Shinoda), Group A03 (Suzuki), and Group B02 (Endo). Jinam et al. (2021b) analyzed three datasets of modern Yaponesian genomes, and showed that the ‘inner dualstructure’ model of Yaponesia proposed and discussed by Saitou (2015, 2017), Saitou and Jinam (2017), and Jinam et al. (2021a) is compatible with these datasets. Adachi et al. (2021) reported the first Jomon genome data from the Higashimyo shell midden site, Kyushu, dated c. 8000 years ago. Their principal-components analysis shows that the genome of Hokkaido Jomon people reported by Kanzawa-Kiriyama et al. (2019) and that of Kyushu Jomon reported by Adachi et al. (2021) are very similar, suggesting striking homogeneity of the Jomon people over a long time. Suzuki (2021) examined the substitution rates of rodent mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and showed the existence of a time dependence of those evolutionary rates. Based on this finding and using mtDNA data reported by Li et al. (2020), he suggested there were two waves of mice migration to Yaponesia: one by the subspecies M. m. castaneus 3500– 3000 years ago and the other by the subspecies M. m. musculus around 2700 years ago. These two migrations fit pretty well with the second and third migrations of humans to Yaponesia proposed by Saitou (2017). Endo (2021) examined four kinds of toponyms from a literature on the history of three kingdoms in the southern part of the Korean peninsula by Busik et al. (1145). He concluded that Japonic-speaking people still dwelled in the central area of the peninsula and in the northern area of the Yalu River during the three-kingdom period up to the 7th century A.D. I hope these six articles are useful for researchers studying the origin and developments of Yaponesians.

2da055133b7426d2d74f881285d3e3e8b04f1085,The COVID‐19 pandemic is a global indoor air crisis that should lead to change: A message commemorating 30 years of Indoor Air,"The commemoration of 30 years of the Indoor Air journal coincides with the oneyear anniversary of the COVID19 pandemic. Roughly one and a half years after its start, the COVID19 pandemic is already one of the worst human health crises since the end of WWII. Globally, as of September 2021, more than 210 million people have been infected, more than 4.5 million people have died,1 and the associated disruption caused a 7% economic loss during 2020.2 Global vaccination is not proceeding rapidly enough to eliminate the virus as it continues mutating into variants of concern. With its unlikely elimination, SARSCoV2 will remain an ongoing challenge together with other endemic infections such as influenza. Many reflections about the pandemic have been written, but one major topic seems to have been ignored: What could have been done to prevent the transmission of SARSCoV2? No transmission means no pandemic. In 1969, the American author Michael Crichton wrote in his novel The Andromeda Strain about the effort to contain a deadly extraterrestial pathogen, “A crisis is the sum of intuition and blind spots, a blend of facts noted and facts ignored.” What are the blind spots and the facts ignored in the COVID19 pandemic? The infectious disease transmission concepts of airborne, droplet, fomite, and contact routes have remained nearly unchanged since the sixteenth century even though the underlying science developed rapidly starting in the early twentieth century.3 The terminology is confusing for the public and even scientists are challenged to communicate clearly across disciplines. In some relevant academic workshops we have attended, participants spent disproportionate time attempting to reconcile what is understood to be airborne transmission. The airborne route is easily conflated with longdistance transmission, which is inaccurately perceived to be fearful, dangerous, and very difficult to control. Shortrange airborne transmission is often confused with the large droplet route. In a recent Indoor Air editorial,3 a set of new terms was proposed: aerosol inhalation, droplet (drop) spray, and surface touch. With these three transmission concepts, the associated interventions should be easy to identify— minimize inhalation of infectious agents, avoid contact via drop deposition, and keep surfaces/hands clean. A similar set of terms was recently adopted by US CDC,4 that is, inhalation, deposition, and touching. WHO5 and US CDC4 also have finally accepted that shortrange inhalation predominates the transmission of SARSCoV2, more than a year into the pandemic. Although regrettably late, this longoverdue recognition still paves the way for more fully recognizing the important role of ventilation and air cleaning, along with physical distancing and routine masking as key measures for protecting against transmission of SARSCoV2 and other respiratory viral infections. Beginning with investigations of the 2003 Amoy Garden SARS outbreak,6 many engineering studies of respiratory infection have been reported during the past few decades. These mechanistic studies proved to be useful in building an understanding of the current pandemic. Scientists of different disciplines have now joined forces on further mechanistic studies of expired flows, respiratory droplets, their transformation and dispersion, deposition in lungs, survival of virus in the evaporating droplets and aerosols, and human behavior in close contact, among other key topics. Such mechanistic studies add insight, constituting an essential part of the scientific inquiry into respiratory infection transmission. The results are useful in making deductions and inferences about the predominant routes of transmission. Science may be defined as sets of logically connected concepts and theories derived from experiment and observation, which lead to new experiments and observations. The pandemic has provided unfortunate opportunities for reallife infection “experiments” and “observations” in hundreds of millions of indoor spaces worldwide. Unfortunately, although thousands of outbreaks have been documented, for at least two reasons many essential details are missing. First, only in circumstances in which the new case rate is low in a community can authorities have the resources to trace each individual case. Second, because of privacy concerns, access to individual and building data has been difficult. Tracing and environment testing are essential, yet often impossible. Fortunately, several outbreaks have been carefully studied,7 which reveal evidence about the possibility of indoor airborne transmission. But for effective intervention, one needs to know not just if the airborne route is possible, but also if it is predominant. A big question emerges: How do we generalize from the nonrandom sample of outbreak cases evaluated to the broader population of transmission events throughout the community?",Indoor Air: International Journal of Indoor Environment and Health,2021.0,24,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/ina.12928', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8653253, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5ac6bb3dec9ce84a204abd0778218d9c71e4d844,The Allende meteorite: Landmark and cautionary tale,"The last days of 1968 would see the success of Apollo 8, marking the first time humans would leave low Earth orbit, and preparation for the Moon landing of Apollo 11 in 1969. This event alone would have marked 1969 as the most significant year in planetary science, but 1969 would prove to be far more historical than anyone might have guessed on January 1. Only an hour into the 39th day of the year, between 1:05 and 1:10 a.m. CST on February 8, 1969, a large fireball traveling southwest to northeast was observed over much of northern Mexico and in adjacent areas of Texas and New Mexico. A 15 kg stone fell within 4 m of a house in Pueblito de Allende, Mexico, the village which would lend its name to one of the most significant meteorite falls of all time. Within 2 days of the fall, Elbert King of NASA’s Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, had traveled to the area and returned with nearly 7 kg of material. The first description of the Allende meteorite (King et al. 1969) was accepted by Science a mere 10 days after the initial fall and published within 20 days! The most complete description of the fall and recovery of Allende was provided by Roy Clarke Jr., Brian Mason, and colleagues from the Smithsonian Institution and institutions in Mexico (Clarke et al. 1970). Clarke and Mason arrived in Parral, west of Pueblito de Allende, on February 12, 1969 (Figs. 1–3). Mason would later recount his first sighting of an Allende stone in the window of the local newspaper office, with one look sufficient to convince him of the remarkable nature of the meteorite. During multiple trips through November, this group would recover more than 1000 stones with a total mass of more than 400 kg. Arizona State University and the Field Museum would likewise amass considerable collections. Altogether, the Allende strewn field covered more than 300 km and yielded an estimated mass in excess of 2 tons. Roy Clarke would tell of children whose pockets were filled with small stones. As curators who often describe our jobs as being “like kids in a candy store,” it seems fitting that Clarke et al. (1970) described “Plastic bags which had previously been used for candy . . . were a favorite storage method for collections of small specimens.” It is almost impossible to overstate the importance of Allende in shaping the field of meteoritics. At the time of this writing, a search of NASA’s Astrophysics Data System Abstract Service yields 2776 papers and abstracts with the word Allende in the abstract. This importance grew from three factors. First was the sheer size of the fall. Allende remains, by far, the largest carbonaceous chondrite by mass. The mass of material available made widespread distribution possible. Clarke et al. (1970) reported distributing material to 37 laboratories in 13 countries within a few weeks and Elbert King had distributed material to an unknown number of additional researchers. Gene Jarosewich spearheaded preparation of the Allende Meteorite Reference Sample (Jarosewich et al. 1987) by powdering ~4 kg of Allende and preparing more than 700 splits. Even 50 years later, some 400 of those splits remain and are regularly requested by the scientific community. Second was the timing of the fall of Allende. With the success of Apollo 8 and the preparation for Apollo 11, world class facilities for analyses of extraterrestrial material were primed and waiting. Allende provided an ideal test of those facilities. Indeed, one motivation for Elbert King’s foray to Mexico was the return of material to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory Radiation Counting Facility, where it was expected that many of Meteoritics & Planetary Science 56, Nr 1, 5–7 (2021) doi: 10.1111/maps.13613",Meteoritics and Planetary Science,2021.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/maps.13613?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/maps.13613, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e8c309ccd8a04c6e3e15260cf30c255ceb37706a,Postprandial Somnolence and its awareness among the Medical Undergraduate Students: A crosssectional study,"Introduction: Postprandial somnolence or commonly referred to as food coma is generally experienced after the ingestion of afternoon meals. The performance of an individual gets affected after the ingestion of a heavy meal and this is more pertinent in a college setup where students have to attend a lecture right after the meal. The objective of this study was to assess the awareness of medical students about the factors responsible for postprandial somnolence, to identify the methods used to counteract it and to ascertain lecturers’ perception on responsiveness and participation of the students in a post lunch lecture. 
Methods: Total 330 students (first year to third year MBBS students) aged between 18-21 years and 40 lecturers teaching first and second year MBBS students were involved in this study. Two separate questionnaires (Part A: students’ perception, and B: lecturers’ perception) were prepared, peer-reviewed, validated and administered to the respective participants. All the responses were compiled and expressed in frequency percentage. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 15.0 for a level of statistical significance of 5%. Pearson correlation was used to get the association between the variables. 
Results: About 55.75% students were aware about the role of serotonin and melatonin in drowsiness but 45.75% students did not know that food rich in tryptophan relaxes the brain and results in sleepiness. Students agree that heaviness of their meal might cause drowsiness and indigestion or bloating, which can also result in lethargy and can affect their performance. Majority of the lecturers opined that students disturb the harmony of the class and are less responsive and participative in post lunch break lectures. 
Conclusion: Thus, the present study provided scope for conducting awareness talks regarding the strategies to counteract postprandial somnolence among medical students which can help improve their concentration during post-lunch lectures.

b4f16b8c1818da8dba3300863057dca54b6b2f10,Verification of APHRODITE Precipitation Data Set in Bangladesh,"We investigated the preformance of Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) of water resources precipitation products in Bangladesh taking rain gauge data as reference for a 3-year period (2003-2005). Various statistical and categorical indices such as coefficient of correlation (CC), bias, relative bias (RB), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), probability of detection (POD), and false alarm ratio (FAR), were applied to measure the performance of the product. With CC value of 0.85, bias of 0.91, RB of -9.5%, MAE of 7.7 mm, and RMSE of 15.2 mm the product tended to underestimate rainfall values during the study period. Although, the POD score of 1.00 demonstrated very good skill in detecting the occurrence of rainfall events, FAR value of 0.25 indicated a considerable amount of false alarms. Moreover, as the precipitation threshold increased, the underestimation became more prominent over the study region. Analysis on the basis of location of the rain gauges also showed that APHRODITE consistently underestimated rainfall values with the increase of extreme rainfall thresholds.

fb1c0c9e40a86baf02b4e3d1f4fcec951fcc67f8,Study protocol for a type III hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of strategies to implement firearm safety promotion as a universal suicide prevention strategy in pediatric primary care,"Background Insights from behavioral economics, or how individuals’ decisions and behaviors are shaped by finite cognitive resources (e.g., time, attention) and mental heuristics, have been underutilized in efforts to increase the use of evidence-based practices in implementation science. Using the example of firearm safety promotion in pediatric primary care, which addresses an evidence-to-practice gap in universal suicide prevention, we aim to determine: is a less costly and more scalable behavioral economic-informed implementation strategy (i.e., “Nudge”) powerful enough to change clinician behavior or is a more intensive and expensive facilitation strategy needed to overcome implementation barriers? Methods The Adolescent and child Suicide Prevention in Routine clinical Encounters (ASPIRE) hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation trial uses a longitudinal cluster randomized design. We will test the comparative effectiveness of two implementation strategies to support clinicians’ use of an evidence-based firearm safety practice, S.A.F.E. Firearm , in 32 pediatric practices across two health systems. All pediatric practices in the two health systems will receive S.A.F.E. Firearm materials, including training and cable locks. Half of the practices ( k = 16) will be randomized to receive Nudge; the other half ( k = 16) will be randomized to receive Nudge plus 1 year of facilitation to target additional practice and clinician implementation barriers (Nudge+). The primary implementation outcome is parent-reported clinician fidelity to the S.A.F.E Firearm program. Secondary implementation outcomes include reach and cost. To understand how the implementation strategies work, the primary mechanism to be tested is practice adaptive reserve, a self-report practice-level measure that includes relationship infrastructure, facilitative leadership, sense-making, teamwork, work environment, and culture of learning. Discussion The ASPIRE trial will integrate implementation science and behavioral economic approaches to advance our understanding of methods for implementing evidence-based firearm safety promotion practices in pediatric primary care. The study answers a question at the heart of many practice change efforts: which strategies are sufficient to support change, and why? Results of the trial will offer valuable insights into how best to implement evidence-based practices that address sensitive health matters in pediatric primary care.

2109d069516fa50d798d7db950b03f017444f5a7,Project-Based Learning: Contrasting Experience Between Traditional Face-to-Face Instruction and Virtual Instruction,"The Introduction to engineering (EGGN-100) is a project-based course offered every fall semester to first-year students with undecided engineering majors at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF). The primary objective of this course is to provide project-based learning (PBL) and introduce these students to major projects in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, and Computer Engineering projects so that they can make an informed decision about their major. The PBL is an active learning method that aims to engage students in acquiring knowledge and skills through real-world experiences and well-planned project activities in engineering disciplines. The course comprises four team-based unique projects related to Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, and Computer Engineering. The project involves using a variety of engineering tools like AutoCAD, Multisim, and Arduino platforms. For the first time, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the hands-on project-based EGGN-100 course was offered virtually. In this research, we document the learning experiences of students who attended EGGN-100 in a traditional face-to-face mode of instruction and students who participated in the same course in a virtual instruction mode. Surveys conducted during seemingly different modes of instruction show varying levels of satisfaction among students. Of the students who attended the course in traditional and instructional instruction mode, 69% and 90% responded that discipline-specific projects enabled them to make an informed decision, and PBL helped them choose their preferred major. Even the percentage of students who believed the PBL helped them make an informed decision about their major, they like to do more hands-on projects and prefer to attend the classes on campus. Students rated higher satisfaction in virtual instructional mode primarily due to the availability of video lectures, self-paced learning, and readily accessible project simulations. Learning by doing would have bought out the challenges and minor nuances of designing and executing an engineering project. Learning by watching is surficial and not necessarily exposes students to minor details that are critical. As such, the significance of this study is that maybe, after all, not all courses can be taught in a virtual environment, and some courses may be strictly taught in a traditional, hands-on instruction mode. We also study the socio-psychological impact of traditional and virtual learning experiences and report the remedies to cope with stress and loneliness in the online learning environment. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37616.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37616?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37616, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2c524bbd241df59c0f83cbc1bd17d51af08fe7e1,WIP: Hands-On Statics in the Online “Classroom”,"Engineering instructors often use physical manipulatives such as foam beams, rolling cylinders, and large representations of axis systems to demonstrate mechanics concepts and help students visualize systems. Additional benefits are possible when manipulatives are in the hands of individual students or small teams of students who can explore concepts at their own pace and focus on their specific points of confusion. Online learning modalities require new strategies to promote spatial visualization and kinesthetic learning. Potential solutions include creating videos of the activities, using CAD models to demonstrate the principles, programming computer simulations, and providing hands-on manipulatives to students for at-home use. This Work-in-Progress paper discusses our experiences with this last strategy in statics courses two western community colleges and a western four-year university where we supplied students with their own hands-on kits. We have previously reported on the successful implementation of a hands-on statics kit consisting of 3D printed components and standard hardware. The kit was originally designed for use by teams of students during class to engage with topics such as vectors, moments, and rigid body equilibrium. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and shift to online instruction, the first author developed a scaled down version of the kit for at-home use by individual students and modified the associated activity worksheets accordingly. For the community college courses, local students picked up their models at the campus bookstore. We also shipped some of the kits to students who were unable to come to campus, including some in other countries. Due to problems with printing and availability of materials, only 18 kits were available for the class of 34 students at the university implementation. Due to this circumstance, students were placed in teams and asked to work together virtually, one student showing the kit to the other student as they worked through the worksheet prompts. One community college instructor took this approach as well for a limited number of international students who did not receive their kits in a timely manner due to shipping problems. Two instructors assigned the hands-on kits as asynchronous learning activities in their respective online courses, with limited guidance on their use. The third used the kits primarily in synchronous online class meetings. We found that students' reaction to the models varied by pilot site and presume that implementation differences contributed to this variation. In all cases, student feedback was less positive than it has been for face-to-face courses that used the models from which the take home kit was adapted. Our main conclusion is that implementation matters. Doing hands-on learning in an online course requires some fundamental rethinking about how the learning is structured and scaffolded. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/38087.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--38087?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--38087, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These changes are predominantly driven by the shrinking pool of traditional 18-22 year old students, the need for working adults to remotely have access to education, and most recently, the abrupt shift to online instruction secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic. Engineering education is not immune to these new dynamics, and institutions need to plan and prepare to embrace new modalities of instruction. Historically, electrical engineering courses have had lab requirements that have involved physical presence in a laboratory with several pieces of test equipment available for testing circuits. In recent years, computer-based laboratory equipment has become available that can provide the same robustness needed to facilitate learning for online electrical engineering courses. A pilot study was conducted at our institution using a home-based laboratory for two electrical engineering courses (Microcontrollers and Electric Circuit Analysis). Presented will be the development of the labs, implementation of the pilot study, description of the labs, and assessment. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37298.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37298?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37298, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

According to the characteristics of the time series of monthly reported cases of human brucellosis in Xinjiang from January 2008 to June 2020, we used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) method and nonlinear autoregressive regression neural network (NARNN) method, which are widely prevalent and have high prediction accuracy, to construct prediction models and make prediction analysis. Finally, we established the SARIMA((1,4,5,7),0,0)(0,1,2)12 model and the NARNN model with a time lag of 5 and a hidden layer neuron of 10. Both models have high fitting performance. After comparing the accuracies of two established models, we found that the SARIMA((1,4,5,7),0,0)(0,1,2)12 model was better than the NARNN model. We used the SARIMA((1,4,5,7),0,0)(0,1,2)12 model to predict the number of monthly reported cases of human brucellosis in Xinjiang from July 2020 to December 2021, and the results showed that the fluctuation of the time series from July 2020 to December 2021 was similar to that of the last year and a half while maintaining the current prevention and control ability.

19bade953818e14600c5aba49a9f9c9785c407a3,Hate Crimes and Gender Imbalances: Fears over Mate Competition and Violence against Refugees,"As the number of refugees rises across the world, anti-refugee violence has become a pressing concern. What explains the incidence and support of such hate crime? We argue that fears among native men that refugees pose a threat in the competition for female partners are a critical but understudied factor driving hate crime. Employing a comprehensive data set on the incidence of hate crime across Germany, we first demonstrate that hate crime rises where men face disadvantages in local mating markets. Next, we complement this ecological evidence with original survey measures and confirm that individual-level support for hate crime increases when men fear that the inflow of refugees makes it more difficult to find female partners. Mate competition concerns remain a robust predictor even when controlling for anti-refugee views, perceived job competition, general frustration, and aggressiveness. We conclude that a more complete understanding of hate crime and immigrant conflict must incorporate marriage markets and mate competition.

Hate crime is on the rise. In the United States, hate crimes hit a 16-year high in 2018 (Hassan 2019). In Sweden, between 2008 and 2018 they grew by 20%, with Islamophoic crimes more than doubling. Xenophobic attacks have also been a pressing problem in Germany, with asylum seekers being a frequent target of vitriol and violence.1 What explains the incidence of and support for these crimes? Existing research points to the dislocations wrought by modernization and social change, or to more immediate triggers, including the inflow of ethnic and racial minorities and the cultural and economic conflicts it can unleash.2 Notwithstanding the importance of these accounts, we highlight a heretofore understudied factor: the fear that the arrival of male outsiders presents a threat Rafaela Dancygier is Professor, Department of Politics and School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544 (rdancygi@princeton.edu).

6d925f77c8ed27286bd655d6c1a0acbf5eddfb1a,Meteorological Influences on Urban Air Quality Parameters in Dhaka City,"This study aims at investigating the effect of meteorological parameters on seasonal variation of particulate matter(PM) (both PM2.5 and PM10) using a 4-year (2013-2016) monitoring data of air quality parameters from CASE project implemented by the Department of Environment (DoE). Using monthly data of the Continuous Air Monitoring Station(CAMS) of Darus-Salam, Dhaka, cross correlation analysisis performed between PM and meteorological parameters where inverse relationships of PM with temperature, rainfall and relative humidity are found. Increased biomass burning during low temperature period, washout effect of rainfall, wet deposition mechanism of higher humidity may be held responsible for these negative correlations. Significant seasonal variation is observed from daily data analysis of Darus Salam station and it is found that winter PM concentrations are 4.5-5.5 times higher than monsoon PM concentrations. Seasonal cross-correlation between PM10 and PM2.5 shows lower correlation during winter (December-February) and monsoon (June-September) seasons. Two possible effects can attribute to this seasonal difference: i) presence of biomass burning during winter which increases PM2.5 and ii) presence of rainfall during monsoon which decreases PM10.PM2.5/PM10 ratios for different months indicate the contrasting influences of different mechanisms on different sized PM particles. PM2.5/PM10 ratio is found to be higher during December-February and lower during March- September with a rise in August, which indicates the effect of 3 mechanisms: i) dilution effect of wind speed on PM2.5 during December-February, ii) re-suspension effect of wind speed on PM10 during March-September and iii) more pronounced scavenging effect of rainfall on PM10 during August. The study indicates the need for properly accounting the influence of meteorology for better understanding of PM variation in urban areas in Bangladesh.

25f0bc677882fb8393897e5dc5a95ef8a760e371,Association Between Clinical-biological Factors and Hypertension in the Urban-rural Population of Boma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,"Hypertension is the main preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Knowledge and control of multiple risk factors for hypertension will reduce its prevalence, better management and therefore a reduction in the burden of disease. This study targeted other risk factors for high blood pressure in Boma, Democratic Republic of Congo. Methods: This was an analytical cross-sectional study. The study population consisted of individuals of the inhabitants of Boma aged at least 18 years living in rural and urban areas for at least one year. This study is a continuation of two previous studies. The sampling was randomized to several degrees which made it possible to select the neighborhoods, avenues, households and then adults to be examined. A total of 1,781 households were listed and 3,800 people were expected, but only 3,510 people were examined and whose blood samples were kept and biological analyzes are being carried out gradually. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 software for Windows. They were expressed in mean standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and in frequencies (n) and percentages (%) for categorical variables. The percentages were compared using the chi-square test. Logistic regression was used to identify independent factors associated with hypertension. The threshold of statistical significance was set at a value of p <0.05. Results: Information from 252 first blood collection samples from Congolese adults living in Boma and over 18 years of age was included in this analysis. The mean age of the study participants was 40.9 ± 15.4 years, of which 71.4% were female. Tobacco, alcohol, diabetes mellitus, and physical inactivity were the most common histories. BMI (p = 0.001), TT (p = <0.001), TH (p = <0.001), TT/Height (p = 0.001) and Uric acid (p = <0.001) values were significantly higher in urban areas than rural. In multivariate analysis, the probability of being associated with hypertension was almost times higher, respectively, AIP≥0.24 (p = 0.357) and Smoking (p = 0.693). It was almost 2 times higher, respectively, for Age≥50 years (p = 0.007), Physical inactivity (p = 0.015), Obesity (p = 0.103). It was nearly 4 times higher, respectively, for Uric Acid> 420 mg/dl (p = 0.001) and CRP> 3 mg/dl (p = 0.015). In the end, it was 10 times higher for Subclinical atherosclerosis (p = 0.001). Conclusion: The results revealed that high blood pressure has several modifiable risk factors such as CRP, uric acid and non-modifiable.

6a50abf3510d10296d8fdb93a241042debbe0ba7,"Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion: Policy Statement","The Editor-in-Chief and Executive Editors of the Journal of Sports Sciences all identify as male and white. Although the journal’s Associate Editors and the Editorial Advisory Board are more diverse, it is cold comfort that the Journal of Sports Sciences is not alone in having very few senior editors who identify as female or people of colour (Martínez-Rosales et al., 2021). The lack of diversity in gender and ethnicity on editorial boards has been an issue for a long time across many fields of study (Alkhawtani et al., 2021; Metz & Harzing, 2009, 2012; Van Miegroet et al., 2019) and the historic underrepresentation of women in public office (Uberoi et al., 2021) and company boardrooms (Davies, 2011) has not evaded academia. Yet, it is argued that the relationship between women and leadership is not simply one of under-representation, but of male dominance (patriarchy), with sport one of the key domains for the confirmation of masculinity (Messner, 2007; Ryan & Dickson, 2018). Although we do not have data on editorial board ethnicity for our field of science, it is likely that people of colour are equally, if not more, under-represented at this level (Ford et al., 2017). Although the under-representation of women is clearly a multifactorial problem (Hardcastle et al., 2019), we can start to understand how the problem may develop in sport and exercise science by examining the gender diversity of students entering academic programmes across countries and continents. In the UK, for example, where the Journal of Sports Sciences is published, 48.7% of the adult population report to be female (Office for National Statistics, 2020), whereas the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency reports that 32% of those studying undergraduate sport and exercise science in the 2019/ 20 academic year were female (13,840 ♀ vs 28,885 ♂) (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-b). The gender imbalance in sport and exercise science contrasts with that observed across all higher education courses in the UK, where 57% of students are female (1.4 M ♀ vs 1.1 M ♂) (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-b). Moreover, the imbalance doesn’t appear to have shifted much over time, with females accounting for 29% of undergraduate sport and exercise science students in the 2014/15 academic year (13,875 ♀ vs 33,325 ♂) (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-c). The number of females doing a postgraduate research or taught degree in sport and exercise science in 2019/20 was 1755, representing 33% of all postgraduate sport and exercise science students (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-b) (1755 ♀ vs 3560 ♂). So, the figures do not differ markedly relative to the proportion studying at undergraduate level. As far as academic staff working in sport and exercise science departments, in the UK, 37% are female (1125 ♀vs 1915 ♂) (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-d). In contrast, the number of female academics across all fields of higher education in the UK in 2019/20 was 104,305, representing 47% of all faculty, which is very close to the proportion of female adults in the UK (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-e). However, the percentage of female academics at “senior” level drops to 39%, and then further to 28% at professorial level. Collectively, these data suggest two things: (1) the gender imbalance in sport and exercise science is evident in undergraduate sport and exercise science programmes; and (2) this imbalance creates a smaller cohort of potential female sport and exercise science academics, particularly at senior level from whom editorial positions are normally filled. Unfortunately, data on ethnicity are not as accessible as those for gender. It is therefore difficult to quantify if sport and exercise science journals and/or student cohorts lack ethnic diversity. Data across all fields of higher education show that about 25% of students are people of colour (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-a), yet fewer than 1% of professors are Black (Higher Education Statistics Agency, n.d.-e), the latter constituting a lower proportion of Black academic staff (3.5%) compared to white professors as a proportion of white academic staff (11.9%) (Joice & Tetlow, 2020). It is therefore highly likely that people of colour are under-represented on editorial boards (Ford et al., 2017). Moreover, the interaction of gender and ethnicity (Ryan & Dickson, 2018) creates an even greater barrier for women of colour. Although women and people of colour are underrepresented at the higher levels of academia and on editorial boards, why does this matter? There are two main reasons. First, although contested, it is a moral issue (Köllen et al., 2018). Second, and as outlined by Fine et al. (2020) in relation to gender diversity, ensuring equal access to leadership positions “makes an important contribution to reducing the broader political, sociocultural, and material disadvantages women face, in part by giving women greater influence in high-level decision-making”.

9741f806f3b54db645572910f05d8e602e6b6455,Leveling the Playing Field: A Virtual Summer Camp for Women of Color,"People of color are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines (STEM). The number is even smaller for women of color who enter into STEM fields. Based on current projections, it is estimated that by the year 2044, underrepresented minorities (Black, Hispanic, LatinX and American Indian) will comprise over 50% of the overall population in the U.S. However, underrepresented minority (URM) youth lag significantly behind their white and Asian American counterparts in their interest in STEM. Lower representation of URMs in STEM can be attributed to a variety of factors including, a lack of institutional commitment, a lack of representation throughout students' upbringing, ineffective cultural recruitment/outreach efforts, educational discrepancies throughout PK-12, and social expectations, among others. A large portion of government efforts to address this problem focuses on initiatives and training to overcome negative perceptions and attitudes towards STEM and entice more URM youth into STEM pathways. For the United States to maintain a competitive position in innovation and technology, the disparity must be reduced. The Women of Color Summer Engineering Camp (WOCSEC) was developed to address the disparity. The camp was composed of six outreach components to provide engaging, critical thinking and uplifting experiences for all its participants. The components include: Engineer Spotlight Interview;Engineering Design Challenge;Empowerment Session;Design Lab;Interactive Forum and Panel;and College Readiness. Due to Covid-19 the camp was transformed from an in-person face to face experience to a virtual experience. Online learning is an effective method of instruction, provided that devices and technology platforms are accessible and screen time is monitored and limited. WOCSEC includes workshops for standardized testing, the college application process, scholarship resources, shadowing opportunities, summer internships and the required high school courses required of most collegiate engineering programs. Students were given a pre-survey the first day of the camp to assess their attitudes and perceptions towards entering STEM fields. In an effort to measure student's change in perception, students completed a post survey. In addition to the pre-post survey, a semi-annual quantitative and qualitative inquiry tool will be administered to camp participants throughout high school to measure their interest in engineering, intent to major in STEM and overall college readiness. In this paper we will describe how the program was implemented, the experience of the participants and share the data from the pre-post survey. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37453?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37453, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Over the past 16 months, schools have been opened and closed numerous times, many universities remain closed, and educators at all levels have had to teach in ways that many had not experienced in the past. It is in this environment that we look forward to each issue of CJSMTE to better understand Science, Mathematics, Technology, and STEM education. I think that this issue will provide you with further insights into these fields. In Issue 20.4, we suggested that we would find opportunities to expand our reach around the world. In this issue, there are articles from Canada, the USA, France, the UK, Costa Rica, and the Netherlands. It is my great pleasure to announce the addition of Dr. Isha DeCoito as an editor for Science (English Language) for the Canadian Journal for Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education. Dr. DeCoito is an Associate Professor in Curriculum Studies at Western University, where she developed and currently coordinates the STEM specialty focus in the teacher education program. Isha is a former CJSMTE Editorial Assistant and Managing Editor of the journal. She has also been a guest editor of special issues in the Journal. In this issue, we have a special theme called Responding to Anti-Black Racism in Science, Mathematics, Technology, and STEM Education. Co-editors Fikile Nxumalo and Wanja Gitari (2021) assembled a highly knowledgeable group of authors to respond to this topic in a variety of settings: science, mathematics, engineering, computer science, STEM, and medicine. They have written a separate editorial to describe the manuscripts in their special theme. Marchand and Munier (2021) explore the teaching of space as part of the science and mathematics curriculum in elementary schools in Québec and France. The article describes their investigation of an Activity-Generating Structure to develop and analyze teaching sequences. They found that, by adapting a traditional way to teach about the discovery of the compass, they can promote students’ acquisition of spatial understanding. They pose a general question about the place and role of manipulation in the science and mathematics class.","Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education",2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42330-021-00161-7.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8300065, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The hotels where the National Emergency Medicine Congresses are hosted, which are held once a year, contribute to congress tourism.The aim of this study is to find out views of attendees of emergency medicine congresses about the congress and presentations. 
Methods: A survey form consisting of 16 questions (without demographic question) was shared with participants attending the 14th National Emergency Medicine Congress of the Association of Emergency Medicine Specialists (EPAT) by SMS, e-mail, and social media messenger programs (WhatsApp, etc.). 
Results: A total of 238 participants took part in the study of whcih73.9% (n = 176) were male. The age of the majority (68, 28.6%) participants was between 35 to 39 years. Maximum participants (n = 95, 39.9%) were specialist titleholders and the majority's (n = 81, 34.0%) length of service was 6-10 years. Of the total particinats, 73.1% and 65% expressed that curiosity about the scientific content and refreshing the knowledge respectively were the reasons for attending the conferences. 
Conclusion: Even if congresses are held in holiday hotels, participants are more interested in scientific content. Paramedical activities and visuals used in presentations are viewed positively. Although there are very intense programs in the congress, the majority of the participants stated that they would listen to eight presentations most efficiently.

bdfca34dfdfa8778ed5e5b971875edaa27801d9e,Digital Dermoscopy Technology In Precise Early Melanoma Detection - Prognosis And New Treatment Options,"Melanoma is a malignant skin disease. Melanoma is difficult to be detected in the early stage, and it is difficult to cure once this disease develops to the late stage. The mortality rate of patients with advanced melanoma is as high as 98%. Melanoma dermatosis can be effectively controlled by early screening and timely treatment. However, due to the unsufficient educated population and uneven distribution of medical resources in Romania, it is difficult for most melanoma patients to get early diagnosis and treatment from doctors. Therefore, it is necessary to study the computer-aided diagnosis technology of melanoma. Material and methods: 32 patients in 2 years (18 male and 14 female), age 24-63, multiple nevi all over the body, new dermatoscopy scanning for the bigger ones, history of sun exposure, dust and toxic agents, 2019-2021. Aim: corellate the early diagnosis of melanoma with the best treatment options and survival rate. Results: all the patients had melanoma detected in early stages (I and IInd) and could benefit from radical surgery and good treatment in oncology department with a good outcome after 1 year. Conclusion: early detection and constant scanning with the aid of dermatoscopy of all the nevi all over the body save lives.

319df0eb8bb55db41fb8d8eab8415deae753273d,STUDIES ON THE IMPACT OF WORK FROM HOME DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW,"When the pandemic outbreak happened back in the year 2020, the Government and the policymakers took preventive steps and directive measures to sustain social movement and infection among the citizens. Common action that has been taken globally was the implementation of lockdown. Consequently, non-essential businesses or organizations had to resolve to transition from central office to work-from-home for as long as the lockdown period ended. This has brought a greater change in the world of work and boosted the experimentation of work-from-home arrangements worldwide. Despite it being a practice that some may have experienced before, it is still relatively uncommon and unusual to be done on such a large scale for some countries. Therefore, many are interested to see the outcome of work-from-home, the impact it had on employers, employees, and companies. However, the ample amount of works of literature made it hard to distinguish the direction and trend of this research. This paper aims to identify and highlight the major findings on the impacts of work-from-home by reviewing 55 published papers in the year between 2020 to 2021 and analyze them through a thematic analysis.

e81e34c4c751f85694ee55a9020ceb887e68ff1b,Early identification and characteristics of potential landslides in the Bailong River Basin using InSAR technique,"The Bailong River Basin is located in the southeast of Gansu Province and situated at the intersection of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Loess Plateau, and the Sichuan Basin. Geohazards, such as landslides and debris flows, have high frequency and wide distribution due to the impact of rainfall, tectonic activity, and earthquakes. These phenomena pose a serious threat to the safety of life and property of the local people. Investigating a new method to detect potential landslide and study its characteristics is important to provide key supports for local disaster prevention and mitigation.In this study, an InSAR technique called Small Baseline Subset was selected to process 60 Sentinel-1A SAR images acquired from March 2018 to March 2019. Moreover, the study area was clipped into 8 blocks to improve the efficiency of data processing and minimize the errors caused by the complex terrain of the region.On the basis of the abovementioned method, the mean surface displacement rates ranging from -158 and 100 mm/year along the line-of-sight direction were detected during March 2018 and March 2019. A total of 114 potential landslides were investigated and identified in the Bailong River Basin based on optical image interpretation and field survey. Statistical analysis of their basic information shows that most of the potential landslides tend to develop in the S, SSW, and SSE-faced slope with a gradient of 20°-40°. The elevation difference of potential landslides is less than 150 m. The slope material is mostly composed of slope deposits and heavy weathered rocks, such as phyllite. The majority of potential landslides have an area less than 5×104 m2.Yahuokou landslide, which was investigated as a potential landslide with displacement rates > 38 mm/year, broke and ran into Min River from 19 July 2019. On the basis of the analysis of landslide pre-cursory deformation and geomorphology, the landslide was divided into three sections: source, propagation, and accumulation areas. The successful identification of potential landslide demonstrates the applicability and efficiency of InSAR technique in landslide investigation and identification. This research provides foundation and scientific support for landslide mapping and disaster prevention in Bailong River Basin. © 2021, Science Press.

The second half of the twentieth century was characterized by a progressively rising awareness on the necessity to work on a more gender-balanced social structure. As a result, during the last few decades increasing attention has been given to the topic “gender and science”, underlining how much careers in science and academia are still subject to gender discrimination. The growing interest and the urgency for change are attested by the large number of commissions and working groups on the topic in national (e.g., Swiss Federal Council, Swiss National Science Foundation, National Science Foundation, USA) and international organizations (European Commission, UNESCO) together with a flourishing number of publications in international journals addressing the problem (e.g., Bernard and Cooperdock 2018; Fassa and Gauthier 2010; Hong and Page 2004; Medin and Lee 2012; Nelson and Cheng 2017; Studer 2012; Wenham et al. 2020). In Switzerland, programs dedicated to promote gender diversity and equality in academic research are supported by the Swiss Federal Government since the beginning of the 2000s through four successive “Equal Opportunities in University” programs. Targets and recommendations have been defined by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the Swiss University Conference (CUS) and the Rectors’ Conference of Swiss Universities (CRUS) (Dubois-Shaik and Fusulier 2015; Dubach et al. 2017). The clear and principal observation is that the proportion of women in academia progressively decreases with advancing career stages (Fig. 1a). This phenomenon is known as the “leaky pipeline”, which affects all research field, but is particularly accentuated in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics; Fig. 1b) disciplines, with the geosciences representing the least diverse of all (Bernard and Cooperdock 2018). However, as highlighted by the Swiss committee of the Gendering the Academy and Research: combating Career Instability and Asymmetries project (GARCIA project, http://garci aproj ect.eu/), the scarcity of reliable data on the different positions in academic careers makes it difficult to analyze the problem, assess the reasons and provide solutions. Data availability is therefore essential for establishing a constant monitoring of the gender diversity and equality evolution in the various academic categories. With this report, we wish to contribute to the understanding of the progress made in the geosciences by looking at the gender representation at the Swiss Geoscience Meeting (SGM). The SGM has been held every year since 2003 and it represents a continuous dataset for gender of participants, providing a portrait of the status and evolution of the gender distribution in Swiss Geosciences over the last 17 years. In addition, participants belong to both fields of geology and geography, giving the opportunity to evaluate both vertical and horizontal gender segregation.

The recognition of aesthetic factors and the prediction of the final facial profile play a very important role in the planning of surgical therapy because the majority of patients are generally very sensitive to any changes in facial aesthetics after orthognathic surgery. Objective Evaluate soft tissue changes (Nose, lips and chin) in relation to the underlying hard tissue movements, and surgical changes after different surgical approaches, designed to treat Class III skeletal malocclusions, including different types of two-dimensional analysis and also threedimensional analysis. Materials We adopted a research strategy based on a query of five digital bibliographic databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library over a 13-year period from 2007 to 2020. We limited our research by using several keywords according to the following search equation: orthognathic surgery/skeletal class III/soft tissue/changes. In addition, no exclusion of articles based on language was made. Results Orthognathic surgery in class III skeletal cases causes quite considerable changes in the facial profile and also in the overlying soft tissues, in the anterior-posterior and transverse direction.

Aim of this study is to compare the preliminary outcomes between duplex-guided foam sclerotherapy and duplex-guided liquid sclerotherapy. The sclerosing foam was produced by Tessari's method. At a minimum, the injected sclerosant must remain in contact with the vessel wall (dwell time) long enough to have the desired effect on the endothelium. Ideally, a sclerosant should stay in the target vessel until that vessel has fibrosed or should wash out from the vessel after a dwell time sufficient to damage the target without damaging any vessels into which it subsequently comes in contact. Method: It is an institutional based prospective comparative observational study carried out in Midnapore medical college and hospital between March 2021 – August 2021. Total 60 patients are selected by simple random sampling and using proper exclusion criteria. These selected patients are finally divided into two groups of 30 patients each. First group undergone foam sclerotherapy using 1% and 3% sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STS). Second group undergone liquid sclerotherapy using 1%,3% STS. Data is recorded and analysed using SPSS software. Result: Foam sclerotherapy is more likely than liquid sclerotherapy in occluding superficial varicose veins after 4 weeks [X2 (1,N=60) = 21.6964, p < 0.00001].Recurrence following Foam sclerotherapy is less likely than liquid sclerotherapy after 6 months [X2 (1,N=39) = 19.5, p = 0.00001]. Occlusion following Foam sclerotherapy is more likely than liquid sclerotherapy after 6 months [X2 (1, N=60) = 32.8507, p < 0.00001]. Conclusion: Foam sclerotherapy is far better than liquid sclerotherapy (p value <0.00001) in occluding the superficial varicose veins and also recurrence is very less in foam sclerotherapy (p value = 0.00001).",Journal of Medical Science And clinical Research,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.18535/jmscr/v9i12.13', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18535/jmscr/v9i12.13?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18535/jmscr/v9i12.13, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Tigecycline revealed significant efficacy and safety against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic microorganisms. The study aimed to reveal the antimicrobial sensitivity and resistance pattern of Tigecycline against ESBL pathogens isolated from surgical site infections. A total of 382 patients with confirmed surgical site infections included in this two-year study. MICs for Tigecycline had determined by using the broth microdilution method with a fresh Mueller-Hinton medium. The MIC breakpoints were as follows: ≤2 μg/g/mg/ml for susceptible; >2 to <8 μg/g/ml for intermediate; and ≥8 μg/g/ml for resistance. MIC50 and MIC90 represent the minimal concentration of antibiotic that inhibited the growth of 50% and 90% of the isolates.

2484ece622fc283aa7bcc81c3823ccc56062223a,Readiness for cancer cervix control in a North Indian population: Identifying the gaps,"Background: Cancer of the cervix is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths amongst women in India. Apart from the availability of healthcare services, awareness and attitude, the cornerstone of public health measures such as screening and vaccination are useful in the control of cervical cancer. There is a lack of studies regarding cervical cancer in the selected region. 
Objectives: To assess the knowledge of cervical cancer and its associated factors amongst rural women in a densely populated state of Northern India. 
Methodology: This cross-sectional study was undertaken for a period of one year, i.e., from April 2018 to March 2019, in five randomly selected villages of the Bakshi Ka Talab Block of District Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Systematic random sampling was performed to include females aged 15 years and above by a house to house survey. Trained social workers interviewed the consenting participants using a self-structured, pretested and validated questionnaire. The suitable statistical test was used to analyze the data. 
Results: The majority of the participants (n=300) were aged between 20- 24 years, and the mean age was 28.5 years. Sixty-four per cent of the females were married, and round 43.7% belonged to lower socioeconomic class. Nearly one third reported to have not heard of cervical cancer previously. The knowledge of the various aspects of cancer cervix varied from 3.2% to 55.3%. The most frequently recognized risk factors were early pregnancy (15.7%), giving birth to ≥ 3 children (13.2%) and early sexual initiation (11.7%). Majority of respondents (56.4 per cent) reported weakness to be the most common effect of leucorrhoea. Nearly half of females falsely perceived the actual cause of the leucorrhoea as excess heat in the body. None of the participants had either undergone screening for cervical cancer or had received HPV vaccination despite the availability of healthcare facilities within 30 kilometres. The educational and socioeconomic status were found to be significant predictors of knowledge of cervical cancer on multivariate logistic regression analysis 
Conclusion: A general lack of awareness has been noted regarding cervical cancer in the study population. None of the participants had undergone screening for cancer cervix or had been administered HPV vaccination, which points to a lack of healthcare utilisation. There is a need to sensitize the target population to the menace of cervical cancer and the usefulness of screening and HPV uptake.

54018342d9d818f4e19233f0a83ce5b1c7f5d68e,Food Chain Arsenic: Additional body burden on health of arsenic,"Introduction 
  
  
Arsenic: The king of poisons, the poisons of kings, and the bane of investigators1. The IARC2 has classified arsenic as a group 1 human carcinogen. Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic can cause cancerous2-5 and non-cancerous health hazards6,7 in humans. Arsenic can get entry into the human body via drinking water, eating food, inhaling dust, and/or ingesting soil. 
  
In arsenic affected areas of West Bengal-India and Bangladesh huge quantity of arsenic is falling on agricultural land. A study in West Bengal-India reported that in a 201 km2 area of the Deganga block in the arsenic-affected district of North 24-Parganas, 6.4 tons of arsenic is falling on agricultural land in one year from 3200 contaminated tube wells for agricultural irrigation8. They expect tons of arsenic is coming with underground water in the arsenic affected areas of West Bengal-India and Bangladesh and falling on irrigated land. Thus, it is expected arsenic is entering the food chain.

Rice and vegetable are the staple food for poor villagers of West Bengal, India and Bangladesh. This is true for the villagers in Kolsur gram-panchayet (G.P.) in Deganga block of North 24-Parganas district, West Bengal-India, where a group of researchers studied for arsenic in soil, rice, and vegetables from fields cultivated with arsenic contaminated water. From the results of total arsenic (drinking water + rice + vegetables + Pantavat + water added for food preparation) body burden to North Kolsur villagers [1185.0 µg for per adult per day and 653.2 µg for per child (around 10 years) per day], as the amount of arsenic coming from rice, vegetables, and water added for Pantavat and food preparation  is 485 µg i.e., 41% of total for adult and 253.2 µg i.e., 38.8% for child and from rice and vegetable 285 µg i.e., 24% of total for adult and 153.2 µg i.e., 23.4% for child9-11. Their findings show most of the arsenic coming from food is inorganic in nature10. They reported that 95% and 5% of the arsenic are inorganic arsenic and methylated arsenic in rice, and 96% and 4% are inorganic arsenic and methylated arsenic in vegetables, respectively10. 
  
  According to WHO12 1.0 µg of inorganic arsenic per day may give rise to skin effects within a few years. 
It has been estimated that based upon the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard of 50 µg/L, the lifetime risk of dying from cancer of the liver, lung, kidney, or bladder, from drinking 1 liter per day of water could be as high as 13 per 1000 persons13. Using the same methods, the risk estimate for 500 µgL of arsenic in drinking water would be 13 per 100 persons14. In its latest document on arsenic in drinking water, the U.S. National Research Council (NRC) concluded that exposure to 50 µg/L could easily result in a combined cancer risk15 of 1 in 100. Comparing to the WHO, EPA, and NRC document with arsenic burden to Kolsur villagers from water and food it appears that Kolsur villagers’ risk of suffering from arsenical skin effect and cancer is there. Compared to worldwide arsenic consumption from food, it appears Kolsur villagers are also consuming high amount of inorganic arsenic from food and vegetables. Kolsur village is an example of many such villages in West Bengal-India and Bangladesh. 
Furthermore, products from arsenic irrigated water- soil system rich in arsenic are also coming to common marketplace far away from contaminated areas and even people who are not drinking arsenic contaminated water may get arsenic from food products produced from contaminated fields. In West Bengal-India and Bangladesh rice, vegetables, and other products are coming to cities (including Kolkata in West Bengal-India and Dhaka in Bangladesh) from villages and possibility that city people consuming arsenic contaminated products from contaminated areas cannot be ruled out.

Data collection was conducted in 5 provinces, 1 soum, 6 districts of Ulaanbaatar City of Mongolia. Population of age of 18-60 years was randomly selected by the survey by using random sampling method. SPSS software version 21 was used for data analysis of the survey. Result: The survey covered in a total of 7633 (baseline, 2015-3852, follow up, 2019-3782) people and the respondent coverage rate was 100%.the majority of them were had higher education (40.8%, 3115), and completed secondary education (secondary and high) (28.9% 2204), khalkh (84.8%, 6472), married (63.1%, 4818), and single (28.7%, 2194).It has been defined that highly educated and female respondents were more knowledgeable than the rest of the group. There were not observed significantly differ on religion, and living location of the person. Knowledge is increased by growing the age of survey respondents. 6.3% of surveyed respondents are regardless of age group and gender had a misconception. Compared with the baseline survey, correct answer percentage level increased by 4.6-64.8% each age group and an average it was 21.8%. In young ages, the population was more likely to donate blood. Based on both survey finding, 82.2% of respondents who gave blood is doing it because they are like to help others and to save people's lives (א=16.37, p<0.0001). In Conclusion: Maintaining public awareness and sustaining regular blood donor is an integral part of establishing a blood donor program. In this regard based on our survey finding evidencebased IEC/BCC campaign has effectively improve awareness general population on sustainable blood programing.

2eb5ea26a8c50aef09e3e2394a0afc7f757f27bb,A New Start: Two Metres at a Time,"There are a number of points in the year that are considered “new” starts. The one that I find the most exciting is the new start in September (in some jurisdictions, the start to the new school year is in August or January, but they are all exciting to me). At this time of year, there is a great potential for new experiences. The newness exists everywhere: the students in our courses, the courses that we teach, our roles within education, our research questions, and new writing projects. The 21.3 issue of CJSMTE is also celebrating new and old becoming new. We have restarted the Newsround feature in the journal. This was a feature that appeared during the early inception years of the journal as a way to share news and happenings in the SMT community. After reflections from previous editors (Blades, 2020) and discussions with the editors, we have included this again. Dr. Alexandre Cavalcante of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto is the editor of the Newsround. His inaugural column appears in this issue. There is also a new feature called the Canadian Mathematics Education Matters by Math Editor Egan Chernoff. In his first article, “The Metre as a Metric: Canada’s COVID-19 Conversion Kerfuffle”, he provides a humourous account of his observations of signs that equate six feet and two metres to describe the social distancing requirements of governments and organizations (Chernoff, 2021). He documents, in written and pictorial form, the poor presentation of the metric system in Canada during the COVID-19 global pandemic. One of the themes in this issue is the creation and use of science textbooks. Kim et al. (2021) interview Canadian science textbook authors to better understand their hopes for textbooks and some of the challenges they encountered. The textbook authors explained how difficult it was to address social issues in their books due to resistance from science teachers. One of their primary hopes was for teachers to develop and use alternate materials, including textbooks, to engage in discussions about socioenvironmental issues, rather than rely solely on science textbooks. Kim et al. (2021) suggest that it is very difficult to shift the discourse of scientific literacy in textbooks, but they are left with a sense of hope of human agency to make some changes.","Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education",2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42330-021-00173-3.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8520461, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

300354dce1abb785bd1315f39702843d29de8a44,Out for Blood: Tyler Shultz and Theranos (A),"In early 2014, recent Stanford University graduate Tyler Shultz was in a quandary. He had been working at Theranos, a blood-diagnostic company founded by Elizabeth Holmes, a Stanford-dropout wunderkind, for almost a year. Shultz had learned enough about the company to realize that its practices and the efficacy of its much-touted finger-prick blood-testing technology were questionable and that the company was going to great lengths to hide this fact from the public and from regulators. Theranos and Holmes were Silicon Valley darlings, enjoying positive press and lavish attention from potential investors and technology titans alike. Just as companies like PayPal had revolutionized the stagnant payments industry and Uber had upended the for-hire transportation sector, Theranos had been positioned as the latest technology firm to substantially disrupt yet another mature sector: the medical laboratory business. By the start of 2014, the company had raised more than $400 million in funding, and had an estimated market valuation of $9 billion. Shultz's situation was exacerbated by the fact that his grandfather, the highly respected former US Secretary of State George Shultz, was on the Theranos board and was one of Elizabeth Holmes's biggest supporters. But Tyler Shultz worried about the customers he was convinced were receiving highly unreliable and often inaccurate blood-test results. With so much at stake, Shultz wondered how he should proceed. Should he raise his concerns with the firm's investors? Blow the whistle externally? Report to industry regulators? Go away quietly? This case and its subsequent four brief follow-up cases are based largely on interviews with Tyler Shultz, and outline the dilemma he faced and the various steps he would take both to extricate himself from his unsavory position and let the public know the full extent of the deception at Theranos. Five optional handouts are available to instructors to further discussion after the case has been debriefed.

The epidemic of preventable IDs becoming endemic to SSA serves as a stack reminder of the region’s systematic failings to health security. It is more important now than ever to evaluate SSA’s vulnerability to COVID-19, a global pandemic becoming endemic to the region after it perhaps gets eliminated from the other world regions. 
 
Method: The International Health Regulations (IHR [2005]) and Global Health Security Index (GHSI) scores for SSA before COVID-19 reached the region were obtained and evaluated to assess its health security preparedness. The number of cases, deaths and stringency measures of the first year of the virus in the region were used to ascertain the possibility of the virus becoming endemic to SSA. By this, COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths of the region were obtained from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The stringency measures put in place by each country were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). Data from the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Online Network (GIDEON) was then used to evaluate the intensity and distribution of endemic or potentially endemic IDs after COVID-19 reached SSA. 
 
Findings: Before the virus reached the region, 31% and 37% of the SSA countries moderately adhered to the IHR and GHSI score respectively. The overall performance of the region in its first year of responding and containing the virus was 56% compared to a global average of 60%. For the first year period of the virus, South Africa with the highest GHSI of 54·8% before the virus reached the region accounted for 55% of the total cases within the first year. Majority of the cases (48%) and deaths (55%) of the first year were recorded in the last three months when values of the stringency measures fell below 50%. For the region, the number of mortalities to cases ratio for the first wave (July 2020) was 1·47:98·53 compared to the second wave (February 2021) of 3·54:96·46. It was also observed that, an average of 222 IDs were endemic or potentially endemic to SSA after COVID-19 reached the region. 
 
Interpretation: It was revealed that there is a high possibility of devastating subsequent waves of COVID-19 and it becoming endemic to the region after assessing the stringency measures that were put in place, relative to the number of cases and deaths over the first year period.

e67fb671f7b5a122b24278cd1d45157cf8ac22b8,Funding for rare tumor research in China under discussion,"‘Throughout the world, medical research has never been equitable. Diseases with more patients and better publicity always grasp more attention, get more funding, and are better studied,’ saidWenmingWu, a digestive surgeon and the vice-President of the Peking UnionMedical College Hospital. The Chinese government released the first List of Rare Diseases in 2018, and the National Rare Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Cooperation Network of 324 hospitals was established in 2019. Additionally, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology invested 38 million yuan (∼6 million US dollars) in theNational RareDiseasesRegistry SystemofChina, which included 186 rare disease cohorts with 65 418 registered patients by 30 May 2021. The government is also adjusting its medical insurance policies to better support patients with rare diseases and their families. However, the 2018 list of rare diseases does not include rare tumors. ‘Rare tumor’ is not a definition but a concept, defined as tumors with annual incidence less than 6/100 000 (EU) or 15/100 000 (US). Differing incidence rates between countries mean that their lists of rare tumors vary greatly, for example, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a rare disease in the United States, but a common cancer in China. ‘Since the large population of China, Chinese researchers use a lower incidence definition of 2.5/100 000 for clinical research, but it still covers 520 000 new patients each year, accounting for 13.3% of all cancer patients,’ said Ning Li, Director of China’s National Cancer Center Office. On 27–28May, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) held a special Forum on rare tumors. Clinicians and scientists working on rare tumors gathered to discuss potential research programs for NSFC. ‘We have to compete with common tumors such as lung and liver cancers. It’s extremely difficult for rare tumor research programs to get funded,’ said Jie Chen, a physician at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University whose specialty is neuroendocrine tumors. Moreover, besides the ‘rare tumors’ in the general sense, rare molecular subtypes of common tumors are also poorly studied. The Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe identified as many as 186 rare cancers. Research funding from NSFC is unlikely to cover all rare cancers. ‘Funding should go for tumors with relatively high incidence in the Chinese population, mucosal melanoma is an example,’ said Jun Guo, vice-Dean of the Beijing Cancer Hospital. Melanoma incidence in China is much lower than that of western countries. However, about 96% of melanoma cases in the western counties are chronic sun-damaged (CSD) melanoma or non-CSD melanoma (5-year survival rates >90%). But in China, more than 70% melanoma cases are acral melanoma or mucosal melanoma, with 5-year survival rates around 54% and 30%, respectively. On theother hand, asChina’s national funding agency for basic research, NSFCmay be more interested in the proposals relating to fundamental scientific problems. ‘Rare tumor research may enrich our understanding of common tumors. For example, neuroendocrine tumormaybe a goodmodel to study cancer metastasis,’ said George Fu Gao, vice-President of NSFC and Director-General of theChineseCenter forDiseaseControl and Prevention. ‘Different rare tumorsmay share commonmolecular targets. It may be a good idea to search for common targets and potential common therapies,’ proposed Hongtao Yu, Dean of the School of Life Sciences of Westlake University. According to Yu, a number of biomedical technologies could be used in rare tumor research, including organoids and other disease models, multiomics analyses, high-throughput drug screening, as well as artificial intelligence. This NSFC Forum on rare tumors is one of the Shuangqing Forums. Every year, NSFC holds about 30 Shuangqing Forums on different topics. However, being selected as a topic does not guarantee more funding from NSFC; this depends on further evaluations. Throughout the world, patients with rare tumors are disadvantaged by poor scientific understanding of these diseases. They often needmuchmore time to be diagnosed, have very few applicable drugs and therapies, and bear heavy economic burdens. To improve their quality of life and to form a better medical care system for them, strong coherent supports are needed not only from NSFC, but also the Ministry of Science and Technology, National Health Commission, and other funding agencies.",National Science Review,2021.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwab106', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8692933, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

I would like to thank the Board of Directors of the World’s Poultry Science Association for their confidence in me and for entrusting the journal to my care. It is a great honour to serve the association in this capacity. I would also like to thank the previous Editors-inChief, Dr. Lucy Waldron and Dr. Juliet Roberts, for their assistance as I transitioned into my new role as Editor-in-Chief of the journal. Again, this is a great honour for me, and I sincerely hope that my performance lives up to the trust placed in me by the board. I have good news to share concerning many metrics for World’s Poultry Science Journal. The 2020 Journal Citation Reports were released, and I am pleased to report that World’s Poultry Science Journal has seen its Impact Factor increase from 1.364 in 2018 to 1.802 in 2019 to 2.915 in 2020. This increase was due in part to a change in the method of impact factor calculation. Clarivate adjusted the time for inclusion of content for the calculation from the issue date to the online publication date. World’s Poultry Science Journal is published online by Taylor and Francis prior to the issue date. The Impact Factor for many journals increased as a result of this change. In addition, the average number of days from article acceptance to online publication for the journal decreased from 73 days in 2019, to 54 days in 2020, to 36 days year-to-date for 2021. Thus, the change in publishers to Taylor and Francis and the shift to earlier online publication helped to increase the impact factor of the journal. Importantly, World’s Poultry Science Journal also moved up in the rankings and is now ranked number 12 out of 63 journals in the Agriculture, Dairy & Animals Science category (previously 15/63). In my opinion, this relative ranking is more important than Impact Factor. I want to commend the Board of Directors for selecting Taylor and Francis to publish our journal and the team at Taylor and Francis for their efforts to decrease the time to publication and to market and increase readership of the journal worldwide. Finally, I want to thank the two previous Editors-in-Chief, Dr. Lucy Waldron and Dr. Juliet Roberts, for all of their efforts in building the journal to where it is today. I look forward to serving the World’s Poultry Science Association as Editor-in-Chief for World’s Poultry Science Journal. My goal is to continue to increase readership and to make the journal even more relevant to poultry scientists and the poultry industries worldwide.",Worlds Poultry Science Journal,2021.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1080/00439339.2021.1965720', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/00439339.2021.1965720?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/00439339.2021.1965720, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3ee454f61f2e2c9612bbb35217d288ff092df717,Mineral Resource Governance in the 21st Century and a sustainable European Union,"Minerals and metals are ingredients necessary for the production of multiple goods and services that are essential to contemporary societies, feeding frequently complex global supply chains. The development of the modern, material-intensive lifestyles has led to a formidable acceleration of their production, particularly since the middle of the 20th century. Despite all the progress that can and needs to be done towards a circular, resource-efficient global economy, several important trends including: demographic growth (United Nations 2019), the rapid development of the global middle class (Kharas 2017), growing urbanisation (United Nations 2018) and the transition towards a low-carbon global economy (Hund et al. 2020) demographic growth (United Nations 2019), the rapid development of the global middle class (Kharas 2017), growing urbanisation (United Nations 2018) and the transition towards a low-carbon global economy (Hund et al. 2020) point towards a continued, exponential growth of the global demand and production of minerals and metals (Christmann 2017; Elshkaki et al. 2018; Halada et al. 2008; Hund et al. 2020; Schipper et al. 2018). Despite the efforts made by some producers and some authorities to strengthen the already important contribution of the minerals and metals industry to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the production of minerals and metals has negative impacts both on the global and on local ecosystems. It already contributes to 16% of global CO2 emissions (OECD 2019) and it generates about 50 bn t solid waste per year, 25 times the estimated annual amount of urban waste (Franks et al. 2021). This waste is composed of mostly barren rock fragments, essentially overburden that needed to be stripped to access the ore, and of fine-grained ore processing tailings. The latter, if containing sulphides such as pyrite and residual minerals containing elements such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury, selenium or tellurium, can become highly problematic for the well-being of future generations. The production of minerals and metals also can be a source of conflicts and of social disruption. Failure to globally and sustainably manage the production of minerals and metals, in a transparent and multilateral framework providing a stable, foreseeable and level playing field for investors and for trade, could limit the capacity of the industry to reply to future demand and lead to potentially disastrous global conflicts. Depending on the practices of individual producers, on the quality of national and/or regional regulatory frameworks and on the effectiveness of their implementation, a same mineral or metal can be produced under very differing environmental and social conditions. Despite progress on sustainability performance reporting and of transparency of some parts of the industry, end-users of minerals and metals do not know how the minerals and metals they use have been produced and they hardly can choose among various supply sources, although from a sustainability perspective there are great differences among the practices of individual producers. The development of an international governance framework to support the development of transparency and verifiable corporate accountability, to foster research and innovation to reduce the negative impacts of the industry and to provide incentives rewarding pro-sustainability action, is called for. Support to document and disseminate best practice and best available technologies as well as to strengthen the global institutional capacities to manage this very complex and vital industry is needed. This could be an important role for a future International Minerals and Metals Agency. So far, only the exploration and mining of deep-sea mineral deposits located in international zones of the oceans are internationally regulated under the UN Convention On the Law Of the Sea (UNCLOS), with a specific International Agency in charge of its implementation and of the provision of scientific and technical guidance: the International Seabed Authority (Kingston, Jamaica), created in 1994. The European Union could and should play an important role in these developments as it is an important global end-user of minerals and metals mostly produced outside its borders. The EU’s environmental footprint outside its borders is very high and growing. According to EUROSTAT trade data, EU imports of goods from beyond its borders doubled in value from 2002 to 2018, with China’s share having grown by over 460% over this period, representing 19% of the total imports of goods. China is the world largest greenhouse gas emitter. EU’s very strong point is its long history of successful research and innovation, dating back to the Renaissance (15th Century BCE). Its very large and highly qualified human resources in science and innovation much benefits from progressive European-scale structuration and integration of mineral- and metal-related research and innovation thanks to the European Union raw material–related policies developed since 2008 (European Commission 2008) under the EU Raw Materials Initiative (see p. 20 ff.). The EIT Raw Materials, launched in 2015, is the world largest organised and funded mineral- and metal-related innovation network, linking over 120 partners from academia, industry and research organisations (EIT Raw Materials, 2021). But, despite these positive developments, it so far lacks the legal basis to develop its own mineral resource policy and its own homogeneous regulatory framework. It nevertheless can act in different areas that are linked to the development of a global, minerals and metals industry based on sustainable development principles through its capacity to act as European Union in domains such as development cooperation, energy, environment, higher education, research and innovation, as well as trade. It will require long-term vision and political leadership to develop and implement a sustainable EU raw materials policy that would also act as a catalyst for the development of much needed global minerals and metals governance. The publication by the European Commission, in September 2020, of its Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials, part of the European Raw Materials Initiative launched in 2008, could be an important step to address the issues outlined in this paper.",Mineral Economics,2021.0,42,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13563-021-00265-4.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8059114, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

02446c8d79e110409da9ba47037e8c2b6f0519b8,Prospective Prediction of Lapses in Opioid Use Disorder: Protocol for a Personal Sensing Study,"Background Successful long-term recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) requires continuous lapse risk monitoring and appropriate use and adaptation of recovery-supportive behaviors as lapse risk changes. Available treatments often fail to support long-term recovery by failing to account for the dynamic nature of long-term recovery. Objective The aim of this protocol paper is to describe research that aims to develop a highly contextualized lapse risk prediction model that forecasts the ongoing probability of lapse. Methods The participants will include 480 US adults in their first year of recovery from OUD. Participants will report lapses and provide data relevant to lapse risk for a year with a digital therapeutic smartphone app through both self-report and passive personal sensing methods (eg, cellular communications and geolocation). The lapse risk prediction model will be developed using contemporary rigorous machine learning methods that optimize prediction in new data. Results The National Institute of Drug Abuse funded this project (R01DA047315) on July 18, 2019 with a funding period from August 1, 2019 to June 30, 2024. The University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review Board approved this project on July 9, 2019. Pilot enrollment began on April 16, 2021. Full enrollment began in September 2021. Conclusions The model that will be developed in this project could support long-term recovery from OUD—for example, by enabling just-in-time interventions within digital therapeutics.

Across times the assessment of QoL had taken several shapes and sizes but with only one single purpose, which is, to assess the state of well-being of an individual, a group of people or the welfare of a region or a nation. With the introduction of data science tools and machine learning algorithms, peoples are able to observe the evolution of a country, governments can evaluate the effectiveness of country-level programs and analyze main factors contributing to this evolution and its impacts and thereby make better decisions. We especially focus on world happiness index, which is an international QoL index developed by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. In this work, we are interested in well-being prediction systems based on machine-learning algorithms. For this purpose, we made a comparative study to explore the potential of the most used machine-learning algorithms on data of The World Happiness Report (WHR). The experiment results showed that regression algorithms achieved an R squared of 0.8954 and RMSE = 0.0656, Lasso Regression, Multiple Linear Regression and LSTM were the best performing algorithms for predicting the QoL indicator for the year 2021.",International Symposium Advanced Electrical and Communication Technologies,2021.0,14,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ISAECT53699.2021.9668429?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAECT53699.2021.9668429, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0bdebeb509c9392031fa933f85a986aef5f6028c,Editorial,"Welcome to the third issue of Volume 130 of Applied Earth Science and my third editorial of 2021. This editorial focuses on diversity, and the importance of diverse viewpoints in both research and mineral exploration. As the snippet of text above indicates, people tend to surround themselves with similar people, or with people who look, and more importantly for this editorial think, alike. This applies to friend groups, to research groups, and to work groups and beyond in industry. Although at first this may create groupings that mesh together well and work effectively, this approach to teambuilding in either academia or industry is fundamentally flawed because it has a tendency to create echo chambers; situations where certain beliefs (or, for example, geological models or types of scientific thinking) are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system that is insulated from rebuttal. This situation is ripe for the stifling of innovation and other failures, as has been demonstrated in a number of cases. One of the most famous of these is the recruitment policies of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from the beginnings of the organisation in 1947 to the late 1990s and early 2000s. These policies undoubtedly led to the recruitment of brilliant people, but these people almost always looked (and thought) in a similar fashion, leading to a very homogenous organisation dominated by white, middle-class, Anglo Saxon, Protestant males. This homogeneity has been blamed for the failures in intelligence that eventually led attacks like September 11th in New York and at the Pentagon (e.g. Jones and Silberzahn 2020). Intelligence agencies in the USA acknowledged these failures, now recognise that diversity is ‘a mission-critical imperative’ (Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2021) and have moved to increase diversity with a series of targeted initiatives to improve the capabilities of organisations like the CIA. Closer to home, the importance of diversity of all types in research and science has been demonstrated numerous times (e.g. Nielsen et al. 2017, 2018; Swartz et al. 2019) and diverse teams within all branches of science are often more successful and more innovative than more homogenous teams. This may seem intuitive but is often ignored, leading to research teams and groups in industry that again act as echo chambers where all of the members of the group have similar knowledge bases and approaches, potentially stifling innovation and the introduction of new ideas. This is especially crucial in mineral exploration and the minerals industry, where breakthroughs often lead to competitive advantages and new discoveries. All of this indicates that diversity and inclusion should be core values for all organisations concerned with innovation and research and moves to improve in these areas may well pay off in numerous ways. Equally important is that all members of teams are recognised for their efforts, innovation, and breakthroughs. This is especially important for demographically under-represented students and researchers who are often more innovative than their more well-represented peers but who also have contributions that are often discounted and who are less likely to obtain higher academic positions (e.g. Hofstra et al. 2020). This lack of equitable recognition is certainly one of the numerous factors involved in leaky pipelines in academia and industry, where talented people from historically under-represented groups miss out on opportunities or leave the sector entirely as a result of a lack of equity within the system. The lack of diversity and the associated lack of acknowledgment of the importance and value of diversity is certainly prevalent in the geosciences (e.g. Bernard and Cooperdock 2018; Dutt 2020) and the minerals industry. Indeed, a number of cases and countries have situations where historically underrepresented groups of all types encounter situations that may well be far worse (and more common) than those that are well-documented in academia (e.g. Botha 2016; Monteiro et al. 2019). All of this acts to drive people from historically under-represented groups away from our science, meaning that the already exclusive and non-diverse geosciences could become even less diverse, to our own detriment. As I mentioned in my Issue Three editorial from last year (Jowitt 2020), I am certainly not suggesting that this editorial (or even my editorial on this topic from last year) covers all of the diversity, equity, and inclusion issues the geoscience community and minerals industry (and beyond) face. However, it is important to realise the value and innovation that having",Applied Earth Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/25726838.2021.1959205?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/25726838.2021.1959205, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The Hokuriku region is characterized by plentiful snowfall and widely-spread, heavy clayey fields, which are limiting factors in the yield of autumn planted onion. Unsurprisingly, this region has a lower onion yield compared to the average onion yield in other parts of Japan. In this study, we evaluated the effect of polyethylene film mulching and the basal application of various slow-release fertilizers on the yield of onion in a heavy clayey field over a period of four years in Joetsu, Niigata prefecture. Plants were seeded in 448cell trays in early September of each year and were then transplanted in mid-to-late October into rows covered with or without black polyethylene mulching film. Within each mulch or nomulch row, fertilizer application was tested. The conventional application subplot (CV) received a basal application of fertilizer at transplanting and a follow-up topdressing in the spring. In the other subplots, any of the slow-release fertilizers (i.e., various types of coated urea or calcium cyanamides) were applied at transplanting along with the same basal fertilizer as the CV subplot. The results are summarized as follows: 1) Although mulching led to a significantly higher yield than no-mulching did in two of the four trials, this increase in yield effect was not observed in the other two trials. 2) With the basal application of some kinds of coated urea or calcium cyanamide, the onion yield was comparable or higher than the CV onion yield in three of the four trials. 3) Among the examined coated urea, LPS40 seemed to be the most appropriate fertilizer to be applied with basal fertilizer in this region.",Soil science and plant nutrition (Tokyo),2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/00380768.2021.1940460?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2021.1940460, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

bbfed2280d90c49c4b55e0c977086c66729901e5,Teachers’ quality of work-life in the regions of Latvia,"In Latvia, during the COVID-19 pandemic teachers represent one of the professions with a special role in solving the problems caused by the crisis. It is important to provide the highest possible quality of education during the state-of-emergency, despite the increased risks of COVID-19 what teachers face while work in a classroom. The workload of teachers has increased and for many of them working conditions have deteriorated. Multiple factors pose a risk to the quality of work-life in general. The aim of the paper is to find out the teachers’ opinions on the factors influencing their quality of work-life, comparing the situation in the regions of Latvia, and to develop proposals for strengthening social dialogue to improve teachers’ quality of work-life. In February 2021, the Latvian Trade Union of Education and Science Employees conducted a survey “Teachers’ Salaries, Principles of Workload Formation and Risks of Professional Burnout”, in which 10 077 teachers were surveyed to study various aspects of their quality of work-life. The results revealed differences between regions in the teachers’ assessment of their quality of work-life and the factors influencing it. The quality of work-life of teachers has decreased, comparing to the situation a year and five years ago. Significantly that 9 out of 10 respondents did not feel cared for at the national level. The authors conclude that it is crucial to improve the social dialogue between the state institutions, employers and employees in order to increase the quality of teachers’ work-life.","22nd International Scientific Conference. “Economic Science for Rural Development 2021” No 55 Sustainable Bioeconomy, Integrated and Sustainable Regional Development, Rural Development and Entrepreneurship, Circular Economy: Climate Change, Environmental Aspect, Cooperation, Supply Chains, Efficienc",2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.22616/esrd.2021.55.011', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22616/esrd.2021.55.011?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22616/esrd.2021.55.011, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

SIOS is developing an efficient observing system, where researchers share technology, experience, and data, work together to close knowledge gaps, and decrease the environmental footprint of science. SIOS maintains and facilitates various scientific activities such as the State of the Environmental Science in Svalbard (SESS) report, international access to research infrastructure in Svalbard, Earth observation and remote sensing services, training courses for the Arctic science community, and open access to data. This perspective paper highlights the activities of SIOS Knowledge Centre, the central hub of SIOS, and the SIOS Remote Sensing Working Group (RSWG) in response to the unprecedented situation imposed by the global pandemic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pandemic has affected Svalbard research in several ways. When Norway declared a nationwide lockdown to decrease the rate of spread of the COVID-19 in the community, even more strict measures were taken to protect the Svalbard community from the potential spread of the disease. Due to the lockdown, travel restrictions, and quarantine regulations declared by many nations, most physical meetings, training courses, conferences, and workshops worldwide were cancelled by the first week of March 2020. The resumption of physical scientific meetings is still uncertain in the foreseeable future. Additionally, field campaigns to polar regions, including Svalbard, were and remain severely affected. In response to this changing situation, SIOS initiated several operational activities suitable to mitigate the new challenges resulting from the pandemic. This article provides an extensive overview of SIOS’s Earth observation (EO), remote sensing (RS) and other operational activities strengthened and developed in response to COVID-19 to support the Svalbard scientific community in times of cancelled/postponed field campaigns in Svalbard. These include (1) an initiative to patch up field data (in situ) with RS observations, (2) a logistics sharing notice board for effective coordinating field activities in the pandemic times, (3) a monthly webinar series and panel discussion on EO talks, (4) an online conference on EO and RS, (5) the SIOS’s special issue in the Remote Sensing (MDPI) journal, (6) the conversion of a terrestrial remote sensing training course into an online edition, and (7) the announcement of opportunity (AO) in airborne remote sensing for filling the data gaps using aerial imagery and hyperspectral data. As SIOS is a consortium of 24 research institutions from 9 nations, this paper also presents an extensive overview of the activities from a few research institutes in pandemic times and highlights our upcoming activities for the next year 2021. Finally, we provide a critical perspective on our overall response, possible broader impacts, relevance to other observing systems, and future directions. We hope that our practical services, experiences, and activities implemented in these difficult times will motivate other similar monitoring programs and observing systems when responding to future challenging situations.

b9f1cbf55ac99da612363d2de2c3242beec073cf,"Spinosad resistance in field populations of melon fly, Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett), in Hawaii","Abstract BACKGROUND Control of Zeugodacus cucurbitae, a serious agricultural pest worldwide, often includes or is dependent on the use of spinosad‐based insecticides. This is especially the case in Hawaii, where GF‐120, a protein bait containing spinosad as the active ingredient, has been in use as a key integrated pest management (IPM) tool against this Tephritid for the last two decades. Here, we report on resistance to spinosad [resistance ratios (RRs) and median lethal concentration (LC50)] in Hawaii's populations of Z. cucurbitae. RESULTS High resistance was found in populations from three farms on Oahu (RR = 102–303; LC50 = 191–567 mg L–1) and in a population from Maui (RR = 8.50; LC50 = 15.9 mg L–1). These will be problematic for control given that the most concentrated dilution ratio on the GF‐120 label is 96 mg L–1 of spinosad (1 part GF‐120 to 1.5 parts water). Background resistance in a naïve wild population from the Island of Hawaii (RR = 2.73; LC50 = 5.1 mg L–1) was relatively low compared with a spinosad‐susceptible laboratory colony (LC50 = 1.87 mg L–1). Resistance in the three Oahu and one Maui populations declined over generations in the absence of spinosad but remained elevated in some cases. Moreover, melon flies collected from one of the Oahu farms 1 year after the cessation of spinosad use revealed high persistence of resistance. CONCLUSION Compared with a 2008 survey of spinosad resistance, our findings indicate a 34‐fold increase in resistance on one of the Oahu farms over 9 years. The evolution and persistence of high levels of resistance to spinosad in Z. cucurbitae in Hawaii highlights the need for alternative control tactics, particularly rotation of active ingredients. © 2021 The Authors.

The experiment consists of an air shower (AS) array with a surface of 83,000m2 and an underground water Cherenkov muon detector (MD) array covering 5,400m2. The experimental site is at the Mt. Chacaltaya plateau in La Paz, Bolivia, with an altitude of 4,740m corresponding to 572g/cm2 atmospheric thickness. As the prototype experiment of ALPACA, the ALPAQUITA experiment aims to begin data acquisition in late 2021. The ALPAQUITA array consists of a smaller AS array (18,450m2) and underground MD (900m2), which are now under construction. ALPAQUITA’s sensitivity to gamma-ray sources is evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation finds that five gamma-ray sources observed by H.E.S.S. and HAWC experiments will be detected by ALPAQUITA beyond 10TeV and ne out of these five - HESS J1702-420A - above 300 TeV in one calendar year observation.

To ensure that body donors are ethically acquired and suitable for anatomy education, Anatomical Donation Programs (ADPs) are tasked with the responsibility of acquiring body donors for basic and clinical science curricula. Considering the personal and institutional impact of SARS‐CoV‐2, a national survey was conducted to examine the current effect of the pandemic on ADP protocols, body donation, and the sustainability of ADPs in the United States (U.S.). Eighty‐nine U.S. ADPs were identified and contacted for optional participation in a survey to assess the impact of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic on their programs. Survey data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools. Thirty‐six ADPs (40.5% response rate) from the nine U.S. Divisions are represented in the survey results. Data were collected on ADP descriptions and demographics, SARS‐CoV‐2 impact on ADPs and protocols, and body donation and ADP sustainability. Almost all ADPs reported that the pandemic has affected their ADP operations in some way; however, the sustainability for the majority of ADPs appears likely and donor availability remains stable due to a proportional decrease in body donations and body donor requests. As the long‐term impact on ADPs has yet to be determined, the authors plan to reevaluate the lasting impact of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic on body donation, ADP sustainability, and anatomical science education throughout the year 2021.","Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.

54d810c8859605a0c7de904b4d0577adcbb57d3d,Mini-Workshop Series for Minority Serving Institutions with ECE Programs,"The Inclusive Engineering Consortium (IEC) planned a full-day workshop for its members in March 2020 to test ideas developed within the organization to more fully and productively engage joint PWI-MSI teams in the US education and research enterprise. The IEC is a novel collaboration among nearly 20 MSIs, most of whom participated in an NSF funded multi-year, engineering education project. This new organization was built on the idea that this collaboration can be leveraged and moved to the next level to provide higher capacity building at each of the consortium members. The hypothesis is that there are windows of opportunity open through establishment of research and educational collaborations between its MSI members with PWI research-intensive institutions. This is especially true since its member institutions serve a unique population of minority students. The IEC is developing the infrastructure and programs to facilitate collaborations between faculty, students and staff in its member departments, based on lessons learned from the previous educational program and, more generally, on the Science of Team Science. It is also addressing how best to build a different type of team structure with PWIs, industry, and other external constituencies. For each type of partner, a process is being defined and tools are being addressed. The purpose of the planned workshop activities was to test the collaboration process and tools by actively engaging partner faculty with PWI department heads and other faculty. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the original plan to hold an in-person workshop. There was no choice but to transition to an environment where interactions, engagement, and networking could still be achieved, albeit virtually. Discussion topics were developed for a series of online, mini-workshops, to be held over several months, with contents and aims similar to the original project. The notable exceptions related to the switch to online education experienced by all partners when their campuses closed in the spring and the urgent need to address anti-racism in engineering education. The overall IEC vision is to be a collaboration of Minority Serving Institutions Working as One to Advance the ECE Enterprise. It is organized as a virtual super department with broadly based strengths in education, scholarship and service. Collectively, it can function as the equal of any ECE program, accomplish more and have a greater impact on its students, faculty and staff through access to resources and opportunities not available individually. It is essential that both its partners and representatives of PWIs work together to realize its grand vision of research and educational collaboration of teams from its partners working as equals with faculty, staff and students from PWIs. This workshop series is a major step in testing out ideas developed within the organization to more fully and productively engage joint PWI-MSI teams in the US education and research enterprise;graduate more and better prepared minority engineers;increase efficiency and productivity at MSIs;and develop a sustainable and effective infrastructure to support minority students, faculty and staff at all universities. In time, the group will grow and the model being developed can be replicated and implemented for other disciplines. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,2,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37508.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37508?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37508, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6e1d40b01e96eb922f23a9392a7a5324c6445f20,Sustainable Bridges from Campus to Campus: The Creation and Conduct of Online Synchronous Summer Bridge Programs in 2020,"Purpose: The purpose of the Sustainable Bridges from Campus to Campus project (NSF IUSE #1525367, known locally as Engineering Ahead) is to establish summer bridge programs that serve Engineering students at regional campuses of The Pennsylvania State University. In 2016, residential summer bridge programs for incoming Engineering students were started at the Abington, Altoona, and Berks campuses patterned after a successful long-standing bridge program at the Penn State University Park campus. Recruitment focuses on enrolling racially underrepresented domestic students (i.e., African American, Hispanic American, Native American, Pacific Islander), women, and first-generation students in Engineering into the bridge programs. The project also supports an established summer bridge program for racially underrepresented incoming Engineering students at the flagship University Park campus. In 2020 (Year 5 of the project) because of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on in-person gathering, the Engineering Ahead residential bridge programs were converted to online synchronous summer bridge programs. This paper presents data on recruitment, enrollment, retention, and students' perceptions of belonging and mattering over time. Goals: The overarching goal of this project is to increase retention and graduation among racially underrepresented Engineering students, with a focus on students who start their Penn State education at a regional campus. Since their inception, the Engineering Ahead summer bridge programs try to increase retention and graduation through three strategies: intensive math review (pre-calculus, calculus), community building, and professional development. Central topics and questions for this paper are how we conducted online bridges, what was offered, student enrollment and retention, what we learned from the process, can social integration among students be achieved virtually, and what were student perceptions of the online bridge experience? Method: Accepted incoming Engineering students (summer and fall 2020) at the Abington, Altoona, Berks, and University Park campuses were encouraged to apply via letter, email, and presentations at accepted student programs to an online summer bridge program to support success in math and science during the first year. Eighty-six incoming students enrolled in the four online bridge programs for incoming first-year Engineering students. Results: We reliably assessed students' sense of belonging and perceived college mattering using standardized measures. Repeated measures analyses showed that there was a significant increase over the 4-week bridge programs of students' sense of belonging and perceived mattering. Conclusions: An important component of summer bridge programs is fostering a sense of community and interpersonal bonds among the students. Results showed that students enrolled in online bridge programs reported significant increases in their sense of belonging and perceived college mattering over four weeks. It appears we captured some of the benefits of summer bridge programs even though they were not residential. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,1,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37793.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37793?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37793, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2312abd33cc47e5c28d2e1010e3b1e238abc9606,Mapping high-pressure crystallography in a structural chemistry landscape,"In this issue of Acta Crystallographica Section B, Michal Kaźmierczak and Ewa PatykKaźmierczak (2021) provide a comprehensive survey of high-pressure crystal structural depositions in the Cambridge Structural Database (Groom et al., 2016) and offer a valuable perspective on the status of high-pressure research within the field of crystal chemistry. For structural chemists, X-ray crystallographic techniques have been recognized as providing an extremely powerful method for the determination of the structure of matter and, specifically, the arrangement of atoms of a crystalline solid in three-dimensional space. The origin of the field comes from the theoretical work of Paul Ewald who, in collaboration with Max von Laue examined the propagation of X-rays through crystals. Encouraged by Laue, Walter Friedrich and Paul Knipping carried out an experiment where they shone a beam of X-rays at a crystal of zinc blende (ZnS) with a photographic film placed behind it to record the diffraction spots. The interpretation of the diffraction images was determined fully by Lawrence Bragg, who inferred that the diffraction events could be understood in terms of mirror-like reflections from planes within the crystal, which he formulated as the now very familiar ‘Bragg’s law’. For their work on translating the information recorded on diffraction images to crystal structure determination at atomic resolution Max von Laue and Lawrence Bragg (with his father William Bragg) won the Nobel Prize for Physics on consecutive years, 1914 and 1915 respectively (Woolfson, 2018). This brief period unlocked the use of X-ray crystal structure analysis for scientists working in disparate fields and by 1929 the output of the fledgling X-ray crystallography community was of sufficient volume for the founding of Strukturberichte, to provide a regularly published source of recent crystal structure determinations. Strukturberichte eventually became Structure Reports as an official publication of the International Union of Crystallography until the 1990s. The period also marked the evolution of X-ray crystallography and crystal structure analysis away from its origins in inorganic chemistry. Long-standing questions on the nature of chemical bonding and interactions in organic chemistry were addressed and the structures of a wide range of natural and synthesized molecules were determined. The biological and life sciences also embraced X-ray crystallography and went on to address several dauntingly complex challenges which, in turn, have revolutionized our understanding of life at the molecular level (Groom & Allen, 2014). From 1929 to the early 1960s, crystal structure compilations and references were print based, with both Strukturberichte and Structure Reports joined by several other publications, and by the late 1940s there were growing concerns about the plethora of sources for primary scientific material, which was dubbed ‘the information explosion’. In 1964, when computer-based systems became feasible, Olga Kennard was invited to create a ‘Crystallographic Data Centre’ with funding from the new UK Office for Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) and by the following year she had established the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) at the University of Cambridge. The remit of CCDC was to establish a comprehensive and retrospective database of organic and metal–organic structures determined by both X-ray and neutron diffraction methods. As well as including the bibliographic, chemical and overall crystallographic information, it was, crucially, to include the three-dimensional atomic coordinate data. The resulting Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), the first fully electronic numerical data depository, was later joined by other databases in the early 1970s, such as the Inorganic Crystal ISSN 2052-5206","Acta Crystallographica.

e5206ac604627c5294ada5a350e79a9420cf6e66,Inequity in Inequity: Disproportional Mortality Risk From SARS in Cancer Patients With COVID-19 in Brazil: A Call to Action,"Background: Cancer was one of the biggest global challenges in public health before COVID-19 pandemic and even higher challenge in low- and middle-developed countries. Confronting both conditions reveal inequalities. We determined lethality and factors associated with mortality in cancer patients who developed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to COVID-19 in a northeast region of Brazil.Methods: Cross-sectional study developed from secondary data of a Brazilian state. We selected cases of cancer patients aged 20 years or older, who developed SARS due to COVID-19 (confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) and were notified between March 07, 2020, and May 08, 2021. Logistic regression analyzed the effects of different variables on lethality.Findings: We identified 756 cancer patients aged 66·3±15·3 years (51·9% males). Global lethality was 75·8% and progressively increased with age. Tumor type was not described in 25·5% (193) of patients, 3·2% had history of cancer, 11·6% had hematologic cancer, and 59·7% had solid tumors. However, different types or topography of tumors did not influence mortality risk. Adjusted multivariate analyses showed age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·02;95%CI 1.01-1·03;p < 0·001) and previous chronic pulmonary disease (aOR 2·02;95%CI 0·96-4·28;p = 0·064) as risk factors for mortality, and overweight (aOR 0·50;95%CI 0·23-1·10;p = 0·087) and cough (aOR 0·57;95% I 0·40-0·83;p = 0·003) as protective factors.Interpretation: Cancer patients who developed SARS due to COVID-19 presented a highly disproportional mortality risk. Death was high in the study population, age increased by 2% the chance of death for each year of life, and lethality was higher in patients older than 80 years. Coordinated proactive strategies are needed to reduce the probability of infection and increase safety and early detection in cancer patients.Funding: This work was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1004701, LD), the National Nature Science Foundation of China (82001629 for XS;81871128, 81571391 and 81401166 for LD;82030040 for HS), the Jiangsu Province Social Development Project (BE2018602, HS), Jiangsu Provincial Medical Youth Talent (QNRC2016006, LD), the Youth Program of Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20200116, XS) and Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Research Funding (2021K277B, XS).Declaration of Interest: The authors have declared that no conflicts of interest exist.Ethical Approval: The human studies were approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shandong University (IRB No. 2021-45), and all samples were donated voluntarily for scientific research after informed consent was obtained.",Social Science Research Network,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/ssrn.3922640?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3922640, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Despite the complexity of multiple time zones, technology challenges, and the virtual space, the program sought to accomplish three goals: (1) community building among students;(2) intellectual engagement with faculty in the home departments;and (3) career development as a foundation for their overall graduate school experience. Participants (N=350 MS or PhD students) were introduced to support services (e.g., health and counseling, ombuds) and student organizations, attended workshops on digital literacy and technology tools, gained perspective from alumni and industry panels, and began their personal career development plan. Evaluations were highly positive, with means of 3.5 - 4.4 on a 5.0 scale, with 5 being very satisfied. Additionally, 98 first-year PhD students were also enrolled in a rigorous and comprehensive online asynchronous TA training, with high satisfaction scores from those who completed the training. While virtual delivery may have limitations, this program has clearly demonstrated that a pre-arrival program can add value to the graduate student on-boarding process and improve the welcome culture at educational institutions. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--38038?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--38038, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2a34eccd722ffa81ca9b6302bb42535208842687,Publications on Post-Covid Mucormycosis: A Bibliometric Study of WHO Database.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a large number of publications to inform, understand, conduct more research and control the situation. Although the researchers are analyzing the bibliometrics on this condition, no bibliometric studies are available on the publications related to post-covid mucormycosis. This study is aimed at bibliometric assessment of the publications related to post-covid mucormycosis.
Methods: In the presented study, authors have performed the bibliometric analysis of the World health organization (WHO) database named ‘Global literature on coronavirus disease.’ WHO is maintaining this database since the pandemic, and it contains thousands of reports. Two simple search terms, ‘Covid’ and ‘mucormycosis’ used to search the entire database in ‘title, abstract, subject’ mode with the search string was tw:(mucormycosis covid). The search was not restricted to any date range.
Results: Only 51 reports (40 articles and 01 clinical trials) were obtained with the above search terms. The study found that there is considerable growth in such publication in the last 6 months. Interestingly only three such reports were published in the year 2020. Database wise 38 of these 51 reports were available in Medline. Most of such reports were published by Indian authors. Indian Journal of Ophthalmology emerged as the most productive journal contributing the highest number (10) of these reports.
Conclusions: The highly acclaimed publications were the reviews. This study suggests that India is the most productive country for publications related to post-covid mucormycosis. This resembles the fact that the country, faced the excessive emergence of post-covid-19 mucormycosis cases reported the secondhighest number of Covid 19 cases in the substantial worldwide outbreak in the second wave, which is followed by post covid mucormycosis.

 Background: Ponatinib and blinatumomab are both highly effective in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The combination of these two agents may lead to deep and durable responses, thereby reducing the need for both chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) in first remission.
 Methods: In this phase II study, adults with newly diagnosed (ND) Ph+ ALL, relapsed/refractory (R/R) Ph+ ALL, or chronic myeloid leukemia in lymphoid blast phase (CML-LBP) were eligible. Patients (pts) were required to have a performance status of ≤2, total bilirubin ≤2x the upper limit of normal (ULN), and alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤3x the ULN. Pts with uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or clinically significant central nervous system (CNS) comorbidities (except for CNS leukemia) were excluded. Pts received up to 5 cycles of blinatumomab as a continuous infusion at standard doses. Ponatinib 30mg daily was given during cycle 1. Ponatinib was decreased to 15mg daily once a complete molecular response (CMR) was achieved. After completion of blinatumomab, ponatinib was continued for at least 5 years in responding pts. Twelve doses of prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy with alternating cytarabine and methotrexate were administered. For pts with ND Ph+ ALL, the primary endpoint was the CMR rate. For pts with R/R Ph+ ALL, the primary endpoint was the overall response rate (defined as the composite of CR/CRi).
 Results: Between February 2018 and July 2021, 43 were treated (24 ND, 14 R/R and 5 CML-LBP). Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median age of the ND and R/R Ph+ ALL cohorts were 60 years (range, 34-83) and 38 years (range, 24-61), respectively. BCR-ABL1 transcripts were p190 in 67% of pts in the ND cohort and 93% in the R/R cohort. 43% of pts in the R/R Ph+ ALL cohort were in salvage 2 or beyond.
 Among 32 pts evaluable for morphologic response, all but 1 pt (97%) responded. Notably, the one non-responding pt had R/R Ph+ ALL and had previously received ponatinib in an earlier salvage regimen. The CR/CRi rate was 100% for ND pts, 91% for R/R pts, and 100% CML-LBP pts. 84% of responding pts achieved CMR (91% in the ND cohort, 91% in the R/R cohort, and 40% in the CML-LBP cohort). The CMR rates after 1 cycle were 64%, 82% and 20% in these 3 groups, respectively. Among 10 pts in the ND cohort who had peripheral blood PCR for BCR-ABL1 evaluated on day 7 of cycle 1, 3 (30%) had already achieved CMR at this early timepoint; 5 out of 13 evaluable patients (38%) had achieved CMR by days 14-21 of cycle 1
 The median follow-up is 9 months (range, 1-38+ months). Among the 24 pts in the ND cohort, 1 pt died in CR, and the rest are all in ongoing response without HSCT in first remission, with a median CR duration of 8 months (range, 1-36+ months). The estimated 2-year EFS and OS for the ND cohort is 95% (Figure 1). Among the 14 pts in the R/R cohort, 2 are too early for response evaluation, 1 did not respond, 4 underwent ASCT (3 of whom are still alive without relapse and 1 of whom relapsed post-ASCT and died), 2 did not undergo ASCT and subsequently relapsed, 1 died in CR, and 4 are in ongoing response without ASCT. The estimated 2-year EFS and OS for the R/R cohort are 53% and 39%, respectively (Figure 1). Among the 5 pts in the CML-LBP cohort, 2 relapsed (1 of whom converted to myeloid immunophenotype) and 3 are in ongoing response without ASCT.
 The combination treatment was well-tolerated, and most side effects were grade 1-2 and were consistent with the known toxicity profile of the two agents individually. Two pts discontinued ponatinib due to toxicity (1 due to stroke and 1 due to DVT). No pts discontinued blinatumomab due to toxicity. No early deaths were observed.
 Conclusion: The chemotherapy-free combination of ponatinib and blinatumomab is a safe and effective regimen in both ND and R/R Ph+ ALL, as well as in CML-LBP. Given the particularly favorable outcomes of pts with ND Ph+ ALL who were not transplanted in first remission, these data suggest that this regimen may serve as an effective transplant-sparing regimen in this population.

d578adf186139ae99bef70040cd0b185ccc6f860,Analyzing the features of energy consumption and carbon emissions in the Upper Yangtze River Economic Zone,": As a vital resource endowment area and ecological barrier area in China, low-carbon development in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is of great significance. This paper compiled the emission inventory in the Upper Yangtze River Economic Zone in the IPCC regional emission accounting method framework and used the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model to evaluate economic development and carbon emissions. Finally, this paper used the time series method to predict carbon emissions to 2030. We find that carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions increased rapidly from 2004 to 2012. The average annual growth rate reached 9.16%. After 2012, carbon emissions in the region no longer grow steadily but fluctuate or even decline. The secondary industry contributed 79.77%, the tertiary industry contributed 17.78%, and the primary industry only 2.45% from 2000 to 2015. From the industrial sector and energy consumption, thermoelectricity production and supply division and nonmetallic mineral products industry are the sectors with the most CO 2 emissions, accounting for 35.54% and 13.34%, respectively. Raw coal and coke are the main factors causing emissions. Nearly 61.32% of the carbon dioxide produced by raw coal comes from the electricity production sector. However, from 2011 to 2015, the CO 2 emissions of raw coal decreased year by year, down by 23.32%. The impact of economic growth on carbon dioxide emissions supports the EKC hypothesis. The CO 2 emissions in the Upper Yangtze River Economic Zone will decline after 2020, but Chongqing has shown an upward trend. With the above results, provinces and cities can optimize the regional industrial structure based on sectoral carbon emissions. The study area needs to develop clean energy to optimize the coal-led energy consumption structure. Provinces and cities in the district can learn from each other’s advanced emission reduction experience. © 2021 The Authors.

03c582e281d2250a5a175b593fd137b79aa55eb2,Developing and testing capabilities for simulating cases with heterogeneous land/water surfaces in a novel atmospheric large eddy simulation code,"Large eddy simulations (LES) are the primary computational tool used to simulate high Reynolds number three-dimensional turbulent flows. In the context of earth system sciences, particularly atmospheric science, LES are uniquely able to resolve the scales of atmospheric motion that are key for building process-level understanding of boundary layer turbulence, atmosphere-surface interaction, clouds, and cloud-aerosol-chemistry interaction, and are a core limited-area modeling capability. Increasing demands are being placed on LES code bases as growing high performance computing resources allow LES to address a wider range of scientific problems. In addition, LES are emerging as a source of high-quality machine learning training data. These demands necessitate an agile and extensible code base that allows the model to quickly adapt to emergent needs. However, LES have largely relied on legacy Fortran code bases that lack flexibility. A new, Python-based LES capability called Predicting INteractions of Aerosol and Clouds in Large Eddy Simulation (PINACLES) has been developed as part of the Department of Energy’s Earth System Model Development (ESMD) program area’s Enabling Aerosol-cloud interactions at Global convection-permitting scalES (EAGLES) project. PINACLES was developed from the ground up with a philosophy of maximizing scientific throughput, by attempting to optimize for both model throughput and software extensibility. The initial development of PINACLES delivered a state-of-the-art idealized LES capability solving the non-hydrostatic anelastic equations of motion with doubly periodic boundary conditions and idealized homogenous surface boundary conditions. Here we provide a final report on the outcomes of a fiscal year 2021 Seed Laboratory Directed Research Project that extended PINACLES in two key ways. First, PINACLES was coupled to a state-of-the-art land surface model enabling it to simulate spatially inhomogeneous land-atmosphere interactions that are known to control key atmospheric processes. Second, the dynamical core of PINACLES was modified to permit non-periodic boundary conditions. This model enhancement enables simulation of realistic cases with boundary conditions prescribed from atmospheric reanalysis and enables nested simulations conducted on a hierarchy of computational domains with increasing resolution. Together, these extensions to PINACLES make it a formidable modeling capability and expand its potential application to diverse components of DOE’s",,2021.0,3,"{'url': 'https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1869291', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2172/1869291?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2172/1869291, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

70f5ed7dc35cb06e9d1d2cf298be56359b8d9428,Evidence–time dilemma in a pandemic with high mortality: Can outcome‐driven decision making on vaccines prevent deaths?,"When the first vaccines were authorized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) in December 2020, its death toll exceeded 2,500,000 deaths globally. Basic science showed an unprecedented pace in its response to the virus with the synthesis of mRNA1273 (Spikevax), the active substance of a COVID19 vaccine, on January 13, 3 weeks prior to the first confirmed death in the United States. Can regulatory science accelerate access to vaccinations, prevent deaths, and overcome the evidence– time dilemma in future pandemics? The death toll of the COVID19 pandemic has only been exceeded by the Spanish Flu in 1918. Early in the first wave of the pandemic, a highly disproportionate distribution of COVID19 infections and deaths was observed between the age groups with a disproportionately high case fatality rate in the elderly subpopulation (<1% in <64yearold, 8.0% in 70– 79yearold, and 14.8% in >80yearold subjects).1 Already at the start of the pandemic, it was obvious that effective vaccines will be the ultimate tool to control the COVID19 pandemic and bring societies back to normality. So, science excelled with the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) virus genome being sequenced on January 11, the active substance, mRNA1273, synthesized on January 13, 2020.2 By December 2020, with an unprecedented speed of less than a year, the mRNA1273 and the BNT162 (Comirnaty) vaccine were developed and granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States.2,3 In April 2020, the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA) discussed aspects for COVID19 therapeutic developments, including clinical trials, realworld evidence (RWE), and compassionate use. They expressed the need for robust evidence to establish safety and efficacy for the proposed medicines, leading to timely regulatory decisions and thus guiding clinicians in defining the best treatment options for COVID19 to serve the patients’ needs in the fastest fashion possible.4 In support of the EUA, the pivotal clinical evidence was generated in large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in an idealworld setting, in the broad adult population, with prevention as the primary end point (starting in July 2020).2 Due to the limited availability of the first two authorized COVID19 vaccines, the United States and almost all other countries prioritized the elderly in the vaccination process. This decision was based on modeling approaches revealing that mortality is minimized in scenarios where the subpopulation with the highest risk of COVID19related deaths is vaccinated first, already established for influenza vaccinations. Unfortunately, in a pandemic with such high mortality, there is an evidence– time dilemma; during the clinical evidence generation, the death toll continues to rise in the real world. Knowing that the second wave is often bigger than the first and was expected to start in autumn 2020 and last until spring 2021 further emphasizes the limited time.

00a71c628556d2e64bb211393cf0072cde689b13,Gottfried Konecny: From draftsman to Professor emeritus – 75 years of involvement in photogrammetry and remote sensing,"This special issue is dedicated to Prof. Gottfried Konecny (see Figure 1), the former president of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) on the occasion of his 90 birthday, which he celebrated in good health and spirits in June 2020 (see Figure 2). A visionary leader and missionary of global topographic mapping, a world scientist and a world citizen who restlessly built and continues to build sustainable bridges between different generations and different peoples of the globe and a true pioneer of photogrammetry and remote sensing, Konecny has shaped our field of research and development over the last 75 years in ways second to none. He also has a very special connection to China, which prompted the Editor-in-Chief of Geo-spatial Information Science to suggest this journal as a very good place to publish this special issue. As the successor of Prof. Konecny at the Institute of Photogrammetry and GeoInformation of Leibniz University Hannover, it is with great honor, joy and thankfulness that Christian Heipke accepted the invitation to be guest editor of this special issue, together with Deren Li. Before presenting the contents of this issue, let us give a brief account of the life and professional achievements of Gottfried Konecny. While he is indeed one of the most well-known personalities in our fields, in particular the younger generation might not be fully familiar with his remarkable career. Gottfried Konecny was born in 1930 in Troppau, Czechoslovakia, to German parents. He started his involvement with mapping when he became a draftsman in 1945, 1 year before moving to Bavaria with his family, in 1946. Between 1950 and 1957, he studied Surveying Engineering at TU Munich and in between he completed a M.Sc. degree in Geodetic Sciences at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, under the supervision of Prof. Frederick J. Doyle, after having been awarded a US Government Fulbright Scholarship. In 1959, he obtained a PhD degree from TU Munich with a thesis on aerotriangulation with convergent imagery, supervised by Prof. Richard Finsterwalder. From 1959 to 1971, he was first Assistant Professor and since 1966 Full Professor and Head of Department at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, Canada, where he was instrumental in developing the first Geomatics Program in North America, which quickly became a role model across the English speaking world, and served as a blue print e.g. at the University of Cape Town in Africa and the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. On the scientific level he greatly contributed to the early development of line scanners and, in particular, to analytical photogrammetry and analytical plotters. Project work led him across the world, we only mention here the National Geographic Society Expedition to Mt. Kennedy, where Konecny served as Chief Surveyor and the photogrammetric survey of the Idikki Dam in Kerala, India. In 1966/67, he was with NASA in Houston during a sabbatical, mapping about 20 lunar landing sites for the Apollo Programme. In 1971, he returned to Germany to take up the Chair at the Institute of Photogrammetry and Engineering Surveys at the (now) Leibniz University Hannover. His major activities comprised the development of remote sensing in Europe. He was the Project Scientist of the first photogrammetric mapping project from space in the world, the Metric Camera, which flew on board the Space Shuttle Columbia from 28 November to 8 December 1983, obtaining a stereoscopic coverage of 10% of the Earth landmass. Another topic of major interest to Konecny was topographic mapping for sustainable development, in particular for less favored areas of the world, which directly led him to bring together photogrammetry, remote sensing and geospatial information systems. As always, he did not only suggest and analyze new ways of mapping, but also pushed for their introduction into work in practice. One such activity he was involved in was the KUDAMS Project to set up an Integrated Urban Geographic Information System in Kuwait, involving control surveys, photogrammetry, digital mapping and GIS, between 1980 and 1990. From 1976 to 1992, he was a member of the ISPRS Council and was responsible for the ISP Congress in Hamburg in 1980. He was instrumental in including remote sensing into the name and the activities of the society, thus transforming ISP to ISPRS. From 1984 to 1988 he served as ISPRS president. Since 1992, he is an ISPRS Honorary Member and has continued to work for the goals of the society in various roles until today. Currently, he serves as Vice Chair of working group WG IV/2 entitled Global Status of Mapping and Geospatial Database Updating.

84d074e0667f33120bce600269ce6fdfce9bd731,The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and its role on the world stage,"It is a pleasure to write this contribution for National Science Review and to share information about the different pathways being followed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) toward a worldwide sustainable society. IUPAC was founded in 1919 with a strong impetus from chemical industries that recognized the importance of using a common language, particularly for chemical compounds, so that they would be able to communicate with each other. After IUPAC’s beginnings in Europe, it expanded and has become a truly worldwide organization, representing the global interests of the chemistry community and scientific communities associated with chemistry. These include academic institutions, industry and society at large. IUPAC’s vision of being a global indispensable source of chemistry is embodied in our mission to provide objective scientific expertise and develop the essential tools for applying and communicating chemical knowledge tobenefithumankindand theworld. This is achieved through our providing a common language for chemistry, advocating the free exchange of scientific information, and fostering sustainable development. Scientific excellence and objectivity, diversity and inclusiveness, are IUPAC core values that are particularly important in order to give objective advice and recommendations as a response to the many challenges that are faced by chemists, the scientific community and society. Our centenary year, 2019, was also the International Year of the Periodic Table of the Chemical Elements (IYPT), of which IUPAC was the leading partner. The many events held all over the world demonstrated the enthusiasm for chemistry by all, of different ages and from all parts of society. It enabled us to show the fascination for the chemical elements and emphasized how many positive things theydo for us in contributing to our lives. A Periodic Table Challenge was held, taken by over 65 000 people in 136 countries. Following its huge success, a second edition was launched in June 2020 and has been equally successful; there are now versions in Chinese, Arabic, Spanish and Russian. The Chinese version has already been taken by several thousand people. Other centenary year initiatives that continued in 2020 and are continuing in 2021 are the Global Women’s Breakfast (GWB), and the Top Ten Emerging Technologies series of articles. Highlighting these new technologies is a way for IUPAC to help show how chemists are contributing to adapting the chemical industry to new needs, with new materials and using processes that are less energy intensive. The Periodic Table of Younger Chemists, another IYPT initiative, in collaboration with the International Younger Chemists’ Network, has led directly to a new project: ChemVoices, the international voice of the younger chemists, which began a series of webinars in September 2020. Core IUPAC activities continue, of course, and we continue to develop chemical nomenclature, with recommendations and technical reports, all open access, appearing in our journal Pure and Applied Chemistry. The ‘Color Books’, provide standards and standardized nomenclature in different areas of chemistry. It will be particularly important to develop Cheminformatics standards, of which the international chemical identifier (InChI) is an excellent example. Pure and Applied Chemistry also publishes themed scientific issues, many of them linked to important contributions made in IUPAC-endorsed conferences. Our publication Chemistry International highlights important news items and the results of our projects, and Chemistry Teacher International is our publication for educators. We value our collaborations with international organizations such as UNESCO, International Science Council (ISC), International Bureau of Weights andMeasures (BIPM), the Organization for theProhibition ofChemicalWeapons (OPCW) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). For example, IUPAP collaborates with us to determine when a new element has been synthesized and identified. IUPAC was awarded the Hague award of the OPCW in 2019 for its work in collaboration with OPCW to further the peaceful uses of chemistry. IUPAC’s 2300 volunteers are from all over the world, representing scientists in different areas of chemistry and multidisciplinary areas with the best skills and knowledge. We have 54 national adhering organizations (NAOs), and over 800 Affiliate Members, Company Associates and Associated Organizations. Together we identify current and emerging scientific issues and problems and reach consensus on approaching and solving them. The Chinese Chemical Society joined IUPAC as an NAO in 1979. Since then, chemical sciences and technology in China have undergone fast development and now China is one of the most important countries in the chemistry field worldwide. China has played an important role in IUPAC. Prof. Chunli Bai has served in the IUPAC bureau and executive committee. Prof. Qifeng Zhou has served as IUPAC President in 2018– 2019; under his leadership, IUPAC coordinated the IYPT activities with great success.",National Science Review,2021.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8288445', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8288445, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4814720f030374d14824c9dfb1cabb13def95e53,Advancements in Canadian horticulture,"Horticultural plants are diverse, high-value, and intensively cultivated for food, medicinal, and ornamental purposes. These plants sustain and enrich our lives by providing nourishment, health benefits, and enhancing the beauty of our landscapes and communities. As a broad discipline, horticulture spans the science and art of producing fruit, vegetable, nut, medicinal, and ornamental plants. The horticultural industry has always been a crucial component of Canadian agriculture, but its importance is ever-increasing as we heed calls for more nutrient-dense food to feed the growing population. For example, Canada’s new Food Guide recommends 50% of our daily food intake should be fruits and vegetables, but agricultural systems are not producing enough fruits and vegetables to meet these nutritional requirements (Bahadur et al. 2018). Although there is promise for Canada to take a leadership role in contributing to the global horticulture industry, wemust also navigate significant challenges associated with increasing and intensifying horticultural production, such as improving the resiliency to climate change; managing biotic, abiotic, and environmental risks; and achieving sustainable production. To support the advancement of Canadian horticulture, here we present the first Special Issue that assembles research encompassing the major horticultural divisions of pomology, olericulture, ornamentals, and medical plants. The articles in this collection span numerous research disciplines of agronomy and crop management, soil and environmental science, crop physiology and stress, integrated pest management, ecology, and postharvest management—but are tied together via a unified focus on horticultural crops across Canada. In this Special Issue, readers will learn about trials that have evaluated various strategies for improving the sustainability of production (i.e., soil amendments, nutrient delivery techniques, fertilizer management practices, inclusion of cover crops in rotations, reducing greenhouse gas emissions), improving resiliency to abiotic and biotic stressors (i.e., detection and etiology of key diseases, cold hardiness, germination under altered light conditions), improving the post-harvest storability (i.e., extending shelf-life), as well as research that characterised horticultural plant genetic, phenotypic, and phenological differences. The Special Issue offers insight into a multitude of horticultural crops and plants— including but not limited to tomatoes, cole crops, root crops, green beans, onions, cucumbers, leafy greens, microgreens, mushrooms, ginseng, apples, pears, grapes, haskaps, hazelnuts, chrysanthemums, gerbera, and trees. The idea for this Special Issuewas inspired by celebrating 100 years of Horticulture Science at the University of Saskatchewan in 2021—a year which also aligned with the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables. In preparing for the 100-year celebrations, we reflected on the long history and progress of horticultural research since the start of the twentieth century. On the prairies, cold-hardy fruit trees, small fruits, and ornamentals were developed in the early tomid 1900s at the University of Saskatchewan; these research efforts and outcomes laid the foundation for today’s prairie horticulture research and industry. In contemplating this history, the advancements over time, and the future of horticulture, the idea was born for a Canadawide Special Issue on horticultural research. With the publication of this Special Issue, we seek to better understand fundamentals and inspire solutions to complex problems related to food and plant production; here, we invite you to explore the 22 contributions from across the country.",Canadian Journal of Plant Science,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/cjps-2021-0239', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1139/cjps-2021-0239?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2021-0239, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

218f33fa8095f8237722b30444b3925655177385,Empowering Engineering Students as Allies Through Dedicated Classroom Instruction,"Women* and other minoritized groups experience an unwelcoming environment in higher education [1-5]. This is particularly acute in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields, where students have reported experiencing both explicit and subtle biased behaviors by faculty, administrators and fellow students [6-12]. The behaviors include stereotypical comments about women and other minoritized students' abilities, microaggressions, sexist humor, etc. Studies have shown that such behavior can lead to negative cognitive effects which in turn can affect student retention and graduation rates [13-15]. The aim of this paper is to document the progression and results of efforts undertaken at The Ohio State University to make the climate more welcoming for minoritized students in the College of Engineering (COE) by offering a course that encourages ally development. Ally development involves training people in the dominant social group and helping them understand the inequities placed on those in the minority [16-17]. This is especially crucial to have in engineering, where on average, the percentage of women receiving a bachelor's degree in the United States is 20.9%. Similarly, the percentage of Hispanic students receiving a bachelor's degree in the United States is 11.4%, Black/African American students is 4.2%, Native American students is.3%, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students is.2% [18]. Ally development, based on the framework created by Broido [19] hypothesizes that engaging students from the dominant group as allies to promote equity in engineering is an innovative strategy for creating a positive climate for minoritized students - and, in turn, ALL students - a factor that influences their retention and graduation rates [20-21]. This initiative started as an informal cohort in 2015-2016 -training students, who identify as men, to be allies for other students. The primary focus of the cohort was on gender. This cohort met weekly to learn about power, privilege, bias, and microaggressions. The participants then developed and implemented outreach activities in the university community. Taking the positive aspects of the cohort, a semester-long course was developed and offered every semester for undergraduate men students around the cohort concepts. Shortly thereafter a complementary class, for students who identify as women, was developed with similar topics as well as additions including confidence and empowerment. In Autumn 2018 the men and women's courses were rebranded as “Inclusive Leadership” courses with topics including personal brand, strengths, values, identity, power, privilege, bias, and microaggressions. The focus extended beyond gender to include race, sexual orientation, physical ability, and other categories of social identity. Gender non-binary students had the opportunity to choose between either of the two courses. In Autumn 2019, the courses' enrolled students were limited to new first year engineering students who self-selected to take part in a pilot “Inclusive Leadership Cohort”. Students in this cohort took the Inclusive Leadership Course concurrently with the first two required engineering courses in their first two semesters at The Ohio State University. Due to COVID, in Autumn 2020, the courses went back to being open to all undergraduate engineering students. Finally, for the Spring of 2021, a single non-gender specific course was offered for the first time. This paper documents the perceived impact on the students who took the courses, lessons learned in each stage of the initiative, and the initial progress on the first non-gender specific Inclusive Leadership Course offered in Spring 2021. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37027.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37027?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37027, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6affa775b1e9302999d210db09628e02d86dc9f6,Preparing Future Engineers Through Project-Based Learning,"A significant amount of research suggests the common reasons students leave an engineering major include lack of faculty mentoring, lack of a sense of belonging, financial hardships, and course difficulties in the prerequisite STEM courses [1]. Project-based learning (PBL) potentially addresses several of these reasons and increases the chances of a student completing an engineering major. Engineering students are more likely to persist when they feel a sense of belonging and community engagement, when they have early interactions with faculty mentors, and when they experience a series of successes [2]. The research question involves whether student research projects with small, faculty-mentored groups promotes student retention. Students participating in Contra Costa College's Center for Science Excellence (CSE) STEM mentoring program are encouraged to apply for external internships and internal research projects. As of the last cycle before the interruption of internship opportunities associated with COVID-19, 79% of participating students intended to apply for summer internships. Students are also able to work on internal research projects mentored by CSE faculty mentors. Over the past three years, engineering students that have participated in research projects have remained in our program and transferred at a high rate. Of thirty student research participants, fourteen have transferred into engineering majors (47%), two have transferred into other STEM majors (7%), eleven continue to take transfer preparatory courses at Contra Costa College (37%), and the educational status of three students is unknown (10%). For the college as a whole, the transfer rate is 32%, the graduation rate is 24%, and the retention rate after one year is 67%. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37595.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37595?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37595, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Due to the unending epidemic of COVID-19, the pedagogy in EFL context at every level of educational institutes has to be shifted to an online approach that has never been implemented in Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna Tak (RMUTL Tak), Thailand. The current study has mainly addressed the research gap by determining underlying cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects in synchronous online learning. Therefore, this paper aimed to investigate perceptions and difficulties of synchronous learning in Academic English course through MS Teams. Academic English skills are not only acquired during the early years of Thai educational system but also at tertiary level. RMUTL Tak has currently provided an Academic English course as a mandatory subject that every undergraduate student has to pass this course before graduation. Promoting synchronous learning to Academic English course allows students have greater learning motivation. In the study, two hundred and fifty four undergraduate students studied in three faculties comprising Business Administration and Liberal Arts, Engineering, and Sciences and Agricultural Technology at RMUTL Tak. They were all enrolling in an Academic English course in the first semester, academic year 2020. Additionally, an online questionnaire including twenty one items and one open-ended question was employed in the study. All obtained data was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings revealed that most of the participants have positively perceived synchronous learning as their fruitful online platform. Nonetheless, it was found that poor internet signal was considered as a dominant factor preventing them from learning online.

This has resulted in unavoidable decline in postgraduate training and learning in different medical specialties. There has been reduction in all aspects of training and learning of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (OBG) residents in general and research training in particular. At the time of the study, although limited institutions have started to put some efforts to resume and endure resident research in OBG but still there are no uniform adaptive measures which can be implemented in all of the institutions. The present study was conducted with the aim to assess challenges faced by OBG residents in doing research during COVID-19 pandemic in a government medical college of India. We also assessed the helpfulness and support provided by the Thesis Mentorship Programme (TMP) of the department during pandemic.
Material and Methods: A self developed semi structured, pre-validated questionnaire was mailed to the residents of the OBG training program of our medical college. It was completed anonymously by them after accepting an informed consent.
Results: 21 postgraduates from the second and third year OBG residency participated in this cross-sectional study. We found that COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significant research training impairment. There was “some” to “complete interruption” in the various research activities of the residents. The research aspect most severely affected was data collection. Also majority of residents were satisfied with the support offered by the TMP of the department in sustaining resident research during pandemic.
Conclusion: COVID-19 has significant and critical implications for the resident research training in OBG.The TMP and similar experiences also helps residents in continuing research during untoward circumstances.

c6f8cfa74ef0cf6baf9451ff51e11d80515daaaf,The COVID-19 Pandemic is Widening the Gap for Women in STEM,"The emergence of the COVID-19 virus in 2019 and its global spread in 2020 presented unprecedented challenges to the world. The virus, which is characterized by high infection and mortality rates, overwhelmed healthcare systems. Governmental leaders, under the guidance of public health officials, responded by putting communities in various states of lockdown to mitigate the spread until healthcare systems could recover. Businesses and schools closed, and many workers were forced to work remotely while children learned how to survive academically in a virtual school environment. The pandemic changed nearly every facet of work and home life, creating a difficult environment for everyone. It is natural for those of us with a mindset toward diversity and inclusion to wonder how marginalized groups are faring in the midst of this global pandemic. Admittedly, there have been multiple accounts of how the pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minorities both in terms of the number of COVID-19 cases and the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths, due in large part to the social, economic, environmental, and political factors that disadvantage members of the African American, Native American, and Latinx communities. At the same time, the data show that millions of women have been pushed out of the workforce to care for children and other dependents due to loss of in-person schooling and child-/ dependent care. Many women opted to stay in the workforce and simultaneously work while providing care for their dependents. Anecdotally, children “Zoom-bombing” their parents’ work calls became an all-too-familiar sight in 2020. Prior to the pandemic, the disparities between women and men in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) persisted despite the many efforts to achieve gender parity, and it is important to note that women who are racial or ethnic minorities have been more significantly disadvantaged. To illustrate the disparity between women and men in STEM, the National Science Foundation reports that 41% of science and engineering doctorates were awarded to women in 2017 despite the fact that women made up 51.5% of the population in the U.S. Note that the percentage of degrees awarded varies drastically by field, with women making up 75% of doctoral degrees in psychology and only 24% in engineering. The reasons for women being underrepresented are complex and involve a range of social and environmental factors, including negative stereotypes and implicit biases that propagate from schools to the workforce. Now that we have gone more than a year in the “post-COVID-19 world,” it is worth exploring how the gender gap for women in STEM has been affected by the pandemic and discuss strategies for bridging the gap. Since March 2020, many in the U.S. workforce have been working remotely, and a large number of K12 schools are still in a virtual or hybrid setting. Daycares are working at reduced capacity, and home care for adult dependents is still not fully accessible. Women have traditionally taken on the brunt of unpaid caregiving duties, and this is no less apparent during the pandemic. The United Nations reports that the lack of childcare during the pandemic has placed an undue burden on women to fill the need for childcare, thereby restricting their ability to work. Power states that this is at least in part due to the persistence of traditional gender roles and because women’s participation in the workforce is more likely to be “part-time, flexible, and less remunerative.” Considering all of these factors, the question arises, “How are women in male-dominated fields like STEM affected by the COVID-19 pandemic?” This article aims to shed some light on the situation for women in STEM. 1521-9615 2021 IEEE Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/MCSE.2021.3067421 Date of current version 15 June 2021.",Computing in science & engineering (Print),2021.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/MCSE.2021.3067421?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2021.3067421, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

537d1714d7ed8760fc888641c56a21848d9e98c5,Development and Validation of a Deep Learning-Based Survival Prediction Algorithm in Patients with COPD Utilizing Chest Radiographs,"Background: Pre-existing indices predicting the prognosis of COPD do not contain radiologic information and are impractical because they involve complex history-taking or exercise tests. We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning-based survival predictor for COPD utilizing chest radiographs (DLSPCXR) and integrate it with other clinical factors (DLSPinteg). 
 
Methods: Patient with COPD who underwent post-bronchodilator spirometry and chest radiograph (CXR) in 2011-2015 were retrospectively collected and split into training (n=3,475), tuning (n=435), and internal validation (n=315) datasets. A deep-learning algorithm predicting survival from CXR was trained (DLSPCXR), and was integrated with clinical factors, including age, body mass index, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (DLSPinteg). For external validation, three cohorts were collected from different institutions (n=337-416). The discrimination performance of DLSP was evaluated using time-dependent area-under-the receiver-operating characteristic curves (TD-AUROCs) for 5-year survival. Using one external validation cohort, DLSP integ was compared with four COPD-specific clinical indices: BODE, ADO, CAT, and SGRQ. Goodness-of-fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. 
 
Findings: DLSP CXR showed TD-AUROC of 0.670-0.761 for 5-year survival, significantly higher than that of FEV1 in two of three external validation cohorts. DLSPCXR demonstrated good calibration (p>0.05) and worked as an independent survival predictor from FEV1 (p<0.01) in all three cohorts. Integrated with age, BMI, and FEV1, DLSPinteg exhibited TD-AUROC of 0.724-0.825, higher than FEV1 in all cohorts (p<0.05). DLSPinteg also showed a comparable-to-higher TD-AUROC than BODE (0.866 vs. 0.801; p=0.34), ADO (0.860 vs. 0.889; p=0.51), CAT (0.930 vs. 0.549; p<0.001), and SGRQ (0.858 vs. 0.702; p=0.09). 
 
Interpretation: DLSPCXR utilizing CXR worked as a significant survival predictor for COPD, surpassing and independent from FEV1. When integrated with age, BMI, and FEV1, DLSPinteg comparable survival prediction performance to other complex COPD-specific clinical indices.

In conclusion Cost leaders seek to improve efficiency and control costs throughout the organizations supply chain. The study recommended that Private hospitals should open more branches in different parts of Mombasa County. Keywords; Cost Leadership, Performance, Private Hospitals. I. BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY ealth care is one of the key pillars of economic development in the sense that, any economy needs a healthy workforce for sustained productivity, economic growth and development. The private healthcare facilities in Kenya focuses on making more profits, the sector is growing fast and with the main aim of delivering the best healthcare services to people in the country. Best quality doctors are employed and they play a major role in private healthcare facilities. The business environment in the last few decades has been faced with numerous changes due to factors such as globalization, adoption of technology, fragmented markets and liberalization of industry rules (Hill, Jones & Schilling, 2014). According to Camisón and Villar-López (2014) the organizations that seek to survive must be fast enough to respond to the pressures to compete on levels unrivalled in the past. Therefore, organizations that survive the turbulent business are those that incorporate a strategy in their long term plan. These strategies are aimed at enabling the firm to gain competitive advantage over their rivals in the market and to enhance long-term performance and profitability. Cost leadership strategies are supported a firm’s ability to supply a product or service at a lower cost than its rivals (Birjandi, Jahromi, Darasi & Birjandi, 2014). The basic operating assumption behind a low-cost leadership strategy is to acquire a considerable cost advantage over other competitors which will be passed on to consumers to realize an outsized market share. According to Cavusgil, Ghauri and Akcal (2013) a low cost strategy then produces competitive advantage when the firm can earn a higher profit margin than results from selling products at current market prices. In many cases, firms attempting to execute low-cost strategies aim to sell a product or service that appeal to a mean customer during a broad target market. Private healthcare facilities are always improving on efficiency by employing the best doctors, nurses and other qualified staffs. And as the public healthcare facilities keep facing challenges every day, like the doctors and nurses strike, more patients keep flocking the private healthcare facilities even if it means spending more money. The technology has also eased the service delivery of the most private healthcare facilities, patients would not take a lot of time to get the medical service. Workers are motivated and thus, deliver in performance, Carolle (2016). In Uganda, there is a poor health system, lack of skilled medical staffs, socio-economic gap where the poor have very few options of accessing health facilities, the spread of HIV/AIDS disease has proved a major challenge in that region. Studies are required to look into strategies of improving the situation in that region, Kiwanuka (2008). In Nigeria, the healthcare system is not developed properly. The poor cannot afford the health care facilities that are too expensive for them while the public healthcare system has little to offer because of poor management of the health system, unskilled staffs, and lack of resources. Much is to be done or implemented with regards to improving healthcare systems in Nigeria, Pharm (2011). Organizational performance is the real productivity of an organization tested against its projected goals and objectives (Upadhaya, Munir, & Blount, 2014). The performance of an organizational is based on the notion that the organization is H International Journal of Research and Innovation in Social Science (IJRISS) |Volume V, Issue VII, July 2021|ISSN 2454-6186 www.rsisinternational.org Page 429 consists of valuable resources that include qualified personnel, physical infrusture and capital assets that are used to achieve a shared achievable goals. In general, Matthew, Grawhich, and Barber (2009) observe that organizational performance is determined by the organization’s capability to respond to threats and opportunities in an effective and efficient manner, with full knowledge of the strengths and weakness at hand. Statement of the Problem The aspect of cost leadership strategies is very important on organizational performance of private hospitals in Mombasa County. Private hospitals in Mombasa County would do better if they adopt cost leadership strategies to meet customers’ needs and at the same time maximize profits. Lukas (2013) analyzed the growth strategies adopted by private hospitals in Nairobi. The study aimed at determining the effect of market development, market penetration, diversification, product development on organizational performance of private hospitals. Using a sample size of 30 respondents, the study involved mean, standard deviation to review data. The researcher failed to include generic strategies to help in organizational performance of the private hospital. Previous studies have endeavoured to explore on effects of competitive strategies adopted by other industries on performance. Mobile telecommunications Companies in Kenya, Kamau, (2013) conducted a study on Competitive Strategies Adopted by Private Universities in Kenya. Another study done by Chepchirchir, Omillo and Munyua (2018) study investigated the effect of Cost Leadership Strategy on Organizational Performance of Logistics Firms at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Kenya. The study data came from 10logistics firms with active websites operating at JKIA Nairobi. Gituku and Kagiri (2015) conducted a study to investigate the effects of competitive strategies on organizational performance of middle level colleges in Thika town. Therefore none of the studies focused on private hospitals within Mombasa County. This study seeks to analyze the influence of cost leadership strategy on organizational performance of private hospitals in Mombasa County. Purpose of the Study The research was to evaluate influence of cost leadership on organizational performance of private hospitals in Mombasa County. Significance of the study The study will assist patients in having the opportunity to get all services under one roof through differentiation. We happen to have a lot of hospitals, but when it comes to all services under one roof, it becomes a major challenge. Therefore, this is emphasized through this study, under differentiation; the management can be able to offer all the services by having all facilities in regard to medical services. II. THEORETICAL LITERATURE REVIEW Institutional Theory Institutional theory was founded by William Scott the year 1995. It considers the role of the firm’s environment and how it directly influences organization structure with its roles, procedures and job positions. The organizational structures provide a room for actions, procedures and norms. This theory highlights how institutions change over a period of time and how they have impact on strategic management, Richard (2013). This theory is relevant to study because, organizations today must acquire a structure to help in coordinating functions, regulations and norms that will guide the firm towards its goals. The study focuses on cost leadership strategies adopted by private hospitals and with this theory its automatically applied for the effective performance of the organization. III. EMPIRICAL LITERATURE REVIEW Cost Leadership Strategy Musila (2013) analyzed the growth strategies and the competitive advantage of commercial banks in Kenya. His research intended to establish growth strategies used by the commercial banks in Kenya. Operating with a sample size of 45 respondents the study applied mean, standard deviation and regression analysis to analyze data. The researcher established that commercial banks in Kenya adopt growth strategies to achieve the competitive advantage in the market. The study also established expansion strategy as one of the many strategies that banks have adopted. The study concluded the firms need to use product development strategies comprising of redesigning the existing product to suit customers and as a result will lead to market expansion. The study recommended that the firms should have clear formulation and plan implementation of strategies, and ensure these strategies are implemented, ensure the staffs have the right knowledge and skills for these strategies to become a success. Also the firm should participate in social responsibilities as this will enable customers have their firms in mind. Michael (2014) analyzed the implementation of cost leadership strategy at Hashi Energy Ltd Kenya. The research aimed at determining the effect of expansion strategy at Hashi Energy Ltd, to investigate the challenges of implementing the expansion strategy at Hashi Energy Ltd. Taking sample size of 6 respondents, research applied mean and standard deviation. The study found that there were economic challenges that hashi energy ltd faced among other challenges like inadequate skills and",International journal of research and innovation in social science,2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2021.5719', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47772/ijriss.2021.5719?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2021.5719, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Many roads are being and will be upgraded to enhance transport efficiency. The hydropower development activities are in full momentum. However, often occurring natural hazards caused by monsoon rain and large-scale earthquakes are major challenges to Nepal’s infrastructure and resilience hydropower projects. Developing an efficient transport network functioning in allweather conditions and resilience hydropower is not possible without the construction of tunnels. The experience indicates that the construction cost for tunnels is considerably higher due to insufficient capacity and knowledge base within Nepal and dependency on foreign agencies who have limited knowledge on the Himalayan geological condition. It is important to enhance ability through specialized high-level education and research within Rock and Tunnel Engineering (both MSc and Ph.D. Levels). This manuscript discusses a new curriculum developed for MSc education in Rock and Tunnel Engineering for the Institute of Engineering (IoE) of Tribhuvan University with the direct help from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), which helped to start the MSc program and first batch of students are enrolled for the academic year 2020/2021 at IoE-WRC Pokhara.

891f1aa581cf941ebf7cc0ac731800ceb62536eb,"A Quasi Experimental Study to Assess the Effectiveness of Psycho Education Delivered by Different Health Professionals on Knowledge among Family Members of Patients with Lithium Therapy at Sneka Mind Care Centre, Thirunelveli, Tamil Nadu","Introduction: Bipdar disorder is a psychiatric disorder that causes extreme shifts in mood energy and functioning. It is characterized by episodes of mania and depression that can last from days to months and usually begins in late adolescence, but can begin in early childhood or as late as a person’s 40s and 50s. All of us experience changes in our mood day by day. Some days we might feel irritable and frustrated, other days we are happy and excited. However, individuals with bipolar disorder experience sever mood savings that impair their daily life and negatively affect their relationship (Cehassemi R.2005). Lithium has the narrow therapeutic index and many factors can upset the balance lithium concentrations that are well tole rated and produce side effects or toxicity. This is imperative that the person taking lithium can be educated about signs and symptoms of toxicity, factors that affect lithium levels how and when to obtain laboratory testing and the importance of regular communication with the prescribing physician. Proposed Topic of Research: A Quasi experimental study to assess the effectiveness of psycho education delivered by different health professionals on knowledge among family members of patients with lithium therapy at sneak mind care centre, Thirunelveli. Objectives: 1) To assess the pretest knowledge of family members regarding lithium therapy in experimental and control group. 2) To assess the posttest knowledge of family members regarding lithium therapy in experimental and control group. 3) To find out the effectiveness of psycho education on lithium therapy of family members in experimental group. 4) To compare the pretest and posttest knowledge of family members regarding lithium therapy between experimental and control group. 5) To find out the relationship between pretest knowledge of family members regarding lithium and selected demographic variables. Hypotheses: There will be a significant difference between knowledge of family members regarding lithium therapy before and after psycho education intervention programme. 1) There will be a significant difference in the knowledge gained by the family members through the psycho education delivered by different health professionals regarding lithium therapy. 2) There will be a significant association between knowledge of family members and selected demographic variables. The conceptual frame work for the present study was based on J.W. Kemy’s open system model, which guided the investigator to help the family members to gain adequate knowledge about lithium therapy. A quasi experimental design was adopted for the study the independent variable was psycho education on lithium therapy and the dependent variables was level of knowledge. The study was conducted for a period of one year. Two hundred and fifty family members of patients with lithium therapy, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were selected for the study knowledge was assessed by structured knowledge questionnaire regarding lithium therapy. The tool was validated by experts in various field of Nursing, Medicine and Statistician. Purposive sampling technique was used to select the sample subjects. The sample size was estimated by power analysis. The sample size was 125 for each group (experimental and control group). The psycho education was delivered by the investigator to experimental group and for control group psycho education was delivered by ANM for 30 minutes. The investigator adhered to human right beneficence and non-malfeasance, dignity, confidentiality and justice. The major findings of the study: In the assessment of level of knowledge among family members of patient with lithium therapy in experimental group it was found that, in the pretest 96.8% family members had inadequate knowledge, 3.2% family members had moderately adequate knowledge and none of family members had adequate knowledge. In the posttest 74.4% family members had adequate knowledge and 24% family members had moderately adequate knowledge and 1.6% family members had inadequate knowledge in the experimental group. 1) While assessing the level of knowledge among family members of patient with lithium therapy in control group. In the pretest 92% of family members had inadequate knowledge and 8.0% of family members had moderately adequate knowledge and none of them had adequate knowledge. In the posttest 58.4% of family members had inadequate knowledge, 40.8% of family members had moderately adequate knowledge and 0.8% had adequate knowledge. 2) It is evident from the findings of the study that the mean score and standard deviation of pretest knowledge score was 6.2 ± 2.4 and after administration of psycho education the knowledge score was 18.2 ± 2.9. The mean difference was 12 ± 3.1 and the ‘t’ test value was t = 42.784 and this is greater than the table value at p < 0.001. This reveals that there is a significance difference in pretest and post test score in experimental group. 3) The findings of the study reveals that the pretest mean and standard deviation knowledge score of family members of patient with lithium therapy in control group was 6.6 ± 2.5, the same after administration of psycho education post test score was 10.6 ± 2.2. The mean difference was 4 ± 2.4 and the ‘t’ test value was 19.066 and this is greater than the table value at p < 0.001. This reveals that there is a significance difference in pretest and posttest. 4) The findings of the study show that while comparing the knowledge among family members of patients with lithium therapy in experimental group and control group. The mean and standard deviation of experimental group was 12±3.1 and control group was 4± 2.4. The mean difference was 8 and ‘t’ test value was t = 22.853. The mean reduction of experimental group was highly significant than the control group. 5) There is no significant association between pretest level of knowledge among family members of patient with lithium therapy and selected demographic variables such as age, sex, type of relationship, education, monthly income, occupation and marital status except religion and type of family in experimental group. 6) Paper ID: SR21830123423 DOI: 10.21275/SR21830123423 668 International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR) ISSN: 2319-7064 SJIF (2020): 7.803 Volume 10 Issue 10, October 2021 www.ijsr.net Licensed Under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY There is no significant association between pretest level of knowledge among family members of patient with lithium therapy and selected demographic variable such as age, sex, type of relationship with patient, education, monthly income, occupation, marital status, religion and type of family in control group.",International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR),2021.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.21275/sr21830123423', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21275/sr21830123423?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21275/sr21830123423, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8c650eb099784d8a35001985cdbc290cd192183b,Engineering Virtual Design Competition – A Solution for High School Summer Outreach During the Pandemic and Beyond (Evaluation),"Aspects of society and culture that encompass the response to COVID-19 have impacted all lives, including those of K-12 students and their families. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic offers a complex context in which students can experience ambiguity with an engineering design challenge as an iterative process of divergent-convergent thinking while focusing on the big picture. Students can learn with an emphasis on systems thinking, making decisions in a collaborative team environment;and managing uncertainty in social processes [1]. The conversations around how schools could function during the pandemic offered a unique opportunity to engage students in problem solving about a situation that they are experiencing themselves. In the US Southwest, three state universities came together during the early stages of the 2020 pandemic lockdown to create a virtual design competition for high school students. The TriU Partnership, including engineering college deans, faculty, and college recruitment and outreach staff from Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University, and the University of Arizona, was formed as an outgrowth of a National Science Foundation, INCLUDES project [2]. One of the aims of this project was to increase engineering awareness and interest amongst a broad population of the state and thereby enhance entry into the state's four-year university engineering programs. The TriU Partnership served 96 high school students from 4 different states in a virtual educational event offered in June 2020. Twenty-five teams of students were asked to consider the challenges their high schools faced in achieving a safe reopening in a pandemic. Over six days, participants attended online seminars, consulted with experts and worked with engineering undergraduate mentors to come up with creative engineering solutions for protective equipment, hallway traffic patterns, bell schedules and social distancing in various high school settings. Final submissions included a detailed engineering notebook, a live online presentation, and interviews with a team of expert judges. The expert judge panel was composed of engineering faculty and industry partners. Teams also submitted prototypes and, in some cases, complete CAD drawings. In this paper, we tell the story of the TriU engineering partnership, share the logistics of the virtual design challenge, talk about lessons learned and share results. Data sources include student survey responses, daily exit tickets, and materials produced such as their final presentation, notebooks, and solutions. The TriU Partnership will continue each summer with each university taking the lead, in turn to offer the design challenge as part of their normal outreach efforts. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2021.0,2,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37078.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37078?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37078, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

710d355f942887d12194fbcd5343a844b8c01a9c,"Early Findings of a Study Exploring the Social Media, Political and Cultural Awareness, and Civic Activism of Gen Z Students in the Mid-Atlantic United States [Abstract]","Aim/Purpose: This paper provides the results of the preliminary analysis of the findings of an ongoing study that seeks to examine the social media use, cultural and political awareness, civic engagement, issue prioritization, and social activism of Gen Z students enrolled at four different institutional types located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The aim of this study is to look at the group as a whole as well as compare findings across populations. The institutional types under consideration include a mid-sized majority serving or otherwise referred to as a traditionally white institution (TWI) located in a small coastal city on the Atlantic Ocean, a small Historically Black University (HBCU) located in a rural area, a large community college located in a county that is a mixture of rural and suburban and which sits on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania, and graduating high school students enrolled in career and technical education (CTE) programs in a large urban area. This exploration is purposed to examine the behaviors and expectations of Gen Z students within a representative American region during a time of tremendous turmoil and civil unrest in the United States.

Background: Over 74 million strong, Gen Z makes up almost one-quarter of the U.S. population. They already outnumber any current living generation and are the first true digital natives. Born after 1996 and through 2012, they are known for their short attention spans and heightened ability to multi-task. Raised in the age of the smart phone, they have been tethered to digital devices from a young age with most having the preponderance of their childhood milestones commemorated online. Often called Zoomers, they are more racially and ethnically diverse than any previous generation and are on track to be the most well-educated generation in history. Gen Zers in the United States have been found in the research to be progressive and pro-government and viewing increasing racial and ethnic diversity as positive change. Finally, they are less likely to hold xenophobic beliefs such as the notion of American exceptionalism and superiority that have been popular with by prior generations.
The United States has been in a period of social and civil unrest in recent years with concerns over systematic racism, rampant inequalities, political polarization, xenophobia, police violence, sexual assault and harassment, and the growing epidemic of gun violence. Anxieties stirred by the COVID-19 pandemic further compounded these issues resulting in a powder keg explosion occurring throughout the summer of 2020 and leading well into 2021. As a result, the United States has deteriorated significantly in the Civil Unrest Index falling from 91st to 34th. 
The vitriol, polarization, protests, murders, and shootings have all occurred during Gen Z’s formative years, and the limited research available indicates that it has shaped their values and political views.

Methodology: The Mid-Atlantic region is a portion of the United States that exists as the overlap between the northeastern and southeastern portions of the country. It includes the nation’s capital, as well as large urban centers, small cities, suburbs, and rural enclaves. It is one of the most socially, economically, racially, and culturally diverse parts of the United States and is often referred to as the “typically American region.” 
An electronic survey was administered to students from 2019 through 2021 attending a high school dual enrollment program, a minority serving institution, a majority serving institution, and a community college all located within the larger mid-Atlantic region. The survey included a combination of multiple response, Likert scaled, dichotomous, open ended, and ordinal questions. It was developed in the Survey Monkey system and reviewed by several content and methodological experts in order to examine bias, vagueness, or potential semantic problems. Finally, the survey was pilot tested prior to implementation in order to explore the efficacy of the research methodology. It was then modified accordingly prior to widespread distribution to potential participants.
The surveys were administered to students enrolled in classes taught by the authors all of whom are educators. Participation was voluntary, optional, and anonymous. Over 800 individuals completed the survey with just over 700 usable results, after partial completes and the responses of individuals outside of the 18-24 age range were removed. 

Findings: Participants in this study overwhelmingly were users of social media. In descending order, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, WhatsApp, LinkedIn and Tik Tok were the most popular social media services reported as being used. When volume of use was considered, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Twitter were the most cited with most participants reporting using Instagram and Snapchat multiple times a day.
When asked to select which social media service they would use if forced to choose just one, the number one choice was YouTube followed by Instagram and Snapchat. Additionally, more than half of participants responded that they have uploaded a video to a video sharing site such as YouTube or Tik Tok. 
When asked about their familiarity with different technologies, participants overwhelmingly responded that they are “very familiar” with smart phones, searching the Web, social media, and email. About half the respondents said that they were “very familiar” with common computer applications such as the Microsoft Office Suite or Google Suite with another third saying that they were “somewhat familiar.” When asked about Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Blackboard, Course Compass, Canvas, Edmodo, Moodle, Course Sites, Google Classroom, Mindtap, Schoology, Absorb, D2L, itslearning, Otus, PowerSchool, or WizIQ, only 43% said they were “very familiar” with 31% responding that they were “somewhat familiar.” Finally, about half the students were either “very” or “somewhat” familiar with operating systems such as Windows.
A few preferences with respect to technology in the teaching and learning process were explored in the survey. Most students (85%) responded that they want course announcements and reminders sent to their phones, 76% expect their courses to incorporate the use of technology, 71% want their courses to have course websites, and 71% said that they would rather watch a video than read a book chapter. 
When asked to consider the future, over 81% or respondents reported that technology will play a major role in their future career. 
Most participants considered themselves “informed” or “well informed” about current events although few considered themselves “very informed” or “well informed” about politics. When asked how they get their news, the most common forum reported for getting news and information about current events and politics was social media with 81% of respondents reporting. 
Gen Z is known to be an engaged generation and the participants in this study were not an exception. As such, it came as no surprise to discover that, in the past year more than 78% of respondents had educated friends or family about an important social or political issue, about half (48%) had donated to a cause of importance to them, more than a quarter (26%) had participated in a march or rally, and a quarter (26%) had actively boycotted a product or company. Further, about 37% consider themselves to be a social activist with another 41% responding that aren’t sure if they would consider themselves an activist and only 22% saying that they would not consider themselves an activist.
When asked what issues were important to them, the most frequently cited were Black Lives Matter (75%), human trafficking (68%), sexual assault/harassment/Me Too (66.49%), gun violence (65.82%), women’s rights (65.15%), climate change (55.4%), immigration reform/deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) (48.8%), and LGBTQ+ rights (47.39%).
When the schools were compared, there were only minor differences in social media use with the high school students indicating slightly more use of Tik Tok than the other participants. All groups were virtually equal when it came to how informed they perceived themselves about current events and politics. Consensus among groups existed with respect to how they get their news, and the community college and high school students were slightly more likely to have participated in a march, protest, or rally in the last 12 months than the university students. The community college and high school students were also slightly more likely to consider themselves social activists than the participants from either of the universities. 
When the importance of the issues was considered, significant differences based on institutional type were noted. 
Black Lives Matter (BLM) was identified as important by the largest portion of students attending the HBCU followed by the community college students and high school students. Less than half of the students attending the TWI considered BLM an important issue. Human trafficking was cited as important by a higher percentage of students attending the HBCU and urban high school than at the suburban and rural community college or the TWI. Sexual assault was considered important by the majority of students at all the schools with the percentage a bit smaller from the majority serving institution. About two thirds of the students at the high school, community college, and HBCU considered gun violence important versus about half the students at the majority serving institution.

e2465e5aa824b9f958ac6fb8cf84630973978f37,Exploring Learner Resilience and Performance of First-Year Computer Science Undergraduate Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This paper presents the findings from a research project exploring the impact of learner resilience as part of the shift to online delivery of learning, teaching and assessment amidst national ""lockdown"" measures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This exploration of resilience was undertaken as part of the delivery of a first-year undergraduate computer science degree programme in a UK higher education institution over two academic years. Resilience was measured by the Nicholson McBride Resilience Questionnaire (NMRQ). The responses from the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 student cohorts (N=214) illustrate that overall learner resilience as measured by NMRQ does not appear to have had a significant impact upon learner success as measured by the mean overall first-year performance. This is an outcome that differs from previous work and may be a consequence of the disruptive (and ongoing) circumstances arising from the pandemic. However, this work identifies that the factor ""I try to control events rather than being a victim of my circumstances"" appears to promote success and the factor ""I trust my intuition"" may have been slightly detrimental to overall success. As we start to consider the post-pandemic new (ab)normal, learners will continue to face significant personal challenges that will impact upon their engagement with their studies and their performance and progression; thus the insights offered from this UK university study can help to inform emerging academic and pastoral practice for undergraduate computer science education.",Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,2022.0,12,"{'url': 'http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/49783/1/iticse2022_paper123_submitted.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'mit', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3502718.3524764?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3502718.3524764, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aims to analyze the research trends of digital health-related articles published on the Web of Science until 2021, in order to understand the concentration, scope, and characteristics of the research. 15,950 digital health-related papers from the top 10 academic fields were analyzed using the Web of Science. The papers were grouped into three domains: public health, medicine, and electrical engineering and computer science (EECS). Two time periods (2012-2016 and 2017-2021) were compared using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. The number of topics was determined based on coherence score, and topic compositions were compared using a homogeneity test. The number of optimal topics varied across domains and time periods. For public health, the first and second halves had 13 and 19 topics, respectively. Medicine had 14 and 25 topics, and EECS had 7 and 21 topics. Text analysis revealed shared topics among the domains, but with variations in composition. The homogeneity test confirmed significant differences between the groups (p<2.2e-16). Six dominant themes emerged, including journal article methodology, information technology, medical issues, population demographics, social phenomena, and healthcare. Digital health research is expanding and evolving, particularly in relation to Covid-19, where topics such as depression and mental disorders, education, and physical activity have gained prominence. There was no bias in topic composition among the three domains, but other fields like kinesiology or psychology could contribute to future digital health research.

This research aims to explore schools’ virtual instructional practices during the unprecedented educational disruptions and understand the preparedness and execution of CS curricula. With quantitative and qualitative approaches, we first evaluated the percentages of different instructional modes, school districts’ implementation of virtual instruction, their support for students, successes and barriers schools experienced, as well as their future plans regarding virtual learning. Findings indicate that hybrid and virtual instruction were prevalent, with disparities in technology access and instructional quality, and schools shared barriers related to technology resources, teacher preparedness, and student engagement. In addition, this study reveals the unequal implementation of CS education, particularly in lower grade levels, underscoring the need for more dedicated resources and teacher support. These insights may help inform future educational strategies for multi-modality instruction and enhance the integration of CS education in K-12 curricula.

c9ace4d873f5926702e1885ae9584b675b1c3318,Enhancing Students' Performance in Computer Science Through Tailored Instruction Based on their Programming Background,"Computer science including data analytics is a widely popular field, boasting promising career opportunities in the future. Proficiency in programming stands as a fundamental requirement for success in this domain. However, students entering MSc programs in data analytics often possess varying levels of programming background, which can impact their performance in assignments. Recognising and addressing these differences through tailored instruction can improve students’ outcomes. This paper explores the importance of considering students' programming backgrounds in the data analytics field and highlights strategies to enhance their performance based on prior knowledge. This study was carried out on two different modules in two different pathways. We have chosen two distinct cohorts and pathways to ensure unbiased conclusions in our study. The initial research was applied to the Database and Programming Fundamentals module for an MSc data analytics cohort, and then we utilized a Deep Learning module for final year computer science undergraduates as a validation cohort. As a conclusion, this study successfully demonstrated a significant increase in student assignment performance through the implementation of tailored instruction based on students' programming backgrounds. Despite receiving positive student feedback and observing excellent and improved performances, it is crucial to acknowledge instances of unsatisfactory student performance as well.

063ffade9ef804455fbdde51dd5232a60014aaf4,"Trends in sperm quality by computer-assisted sperm analysis of 49,189 men during 2015–2021 in a fertility center from China","Background Sperm quality, including semen volume, sperm count, concentration, and total and progressive motility (collectively, “semen parameters”), has declined in the recent decades. Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) provides sperm kinematic parameters, and the temporal trends of which remain unclear. Our objective is to examine the temporal trend of both semen parameters and kinematic parameters in Shanghai, China, in the recent years. Methods This retrospective study analyzed semen parameters and kinematic parameters of 49,819 men attending our reproductive center by using CASA during 2015–2021. The total sample was divided into two groups: samples that surpassed the WHO guideline (2010) low reference limits (“above reference limit” group, ARL; n = 24,575) and samples that did not (“below reference limit” group, BRL; n = 24,614). One-way analysis of variance, Kruskal–Wallis test, independent samples t-test, and covariance analysis were used to assess the differences among groups. Year, age, and abstinence time were included in the multiple linear regression model of the ARL group to adjust the confounders and depict the trends in sperm quality. Results Among all the total sample and the ARL and BRL groups, the age of subjects increased in recent years. Semen volume and sperm count showed declined tendency with years in the total sample, the ARL and BRL groups, and the subgroup of age or abstinence time, whereas sperm velocities showed increased tendency with years on the contrary. The multiple linear regression model of the ARL group, adjusting for age and abstinence time, confirmed these trends. Semen volume (β1= −0.162; CI: −0.172, −0.152), sperm count (β1= −9.97; CI: −10.813, −9.128), sperm concentration (β1 = −0.535; CI: −0.772, −0.299), motility (β1 = −1.751; CI: −1.830, −1.672), and progressive motility (β1 = −1.12; CI: −0.201, −0.145) decreased with year, whereas curvilinear line velocity (VCL) (β1 = 3.058; CI: 2.912, 3.203), straight line velocity (VSL) (β1 = 2.075; CI: 1.990, 2.161), and average path velocity (VAP) (β1 = 2.305; CI: 2.224, 2.386) increased over time (all p < 0.001). In addition, VCL, VSL, and VAP significantly declined with age and abstinence time. Conclusion The semen parameters declined, whereas the kinematic parameters increased over the recent years. We propose that, although sperm count and motility declined over time, sperm motion velocity increased, suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism of male fertility.",Frontiers in Endocrinology,2023.0,10,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2023.1194455/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10390301, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study used bibliometric analysis to assess research hotspots and future trends in studies on immune cells in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Methods We extracted all relevant literature on immune cells and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy from the Web of Science core collection for the period of 2001 to 2021. We used VOS Viewer, CiteSpace, R-bibliometrix and Python for bibliometric analysis. Results We identified 2,388 records published in 593 journals by 9,886 authors from 2,174 universities/institutions in 91 countries/regions. The number of publications tended to increase over time, with the highest number of publications in 2021, up to 205. The USA was the country with the most publications. UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI was the most influential institution. Lamarca B, Romero R, and Saito S were the most prolific authors. Finally, three research hotspot clusters were identified based on keywords, which reflected the role of immune cells in the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, the current research status,and predicted hot spots for future research. Conclusions Our study systematically analyzed the role of immune cells in the pathogenesis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the last 20 years. Our results indicated that immune cells, such as T cells, natural killer (NK) cells,and macrophages, and the cytokines released such as TNF-α, IFN-γ in the maternal circulation and at the maternal-fetal interface would influence the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and we need further investigate the role of individual immune cells and translational studies to provide new therapeutic perspectives to mitigate adverse perinatal outcomes due to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

c719d596a71664ad315e0ce2abd593d48fe96da9,SJMSS Paper of the year 2021,"As a new feature of the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, we have introduced the award of “SJMSS Paper of the Year.” This is awarded to the paper considered as providing new and important insights, having a high level of scientific rigor, and making an important contribution to sport and exercise science and medicine. It is selected by a panel comprised of the Senior Section Editors of the journal. I am delighted that the recipient of the first SJMSS Paper of the Year, which is for 2021, is the paper entitled “How muscles maximize performance in accelerated sprinting” by Pandy and coworkers.1 This paper provides new insights into how leg muscles generate ground force impulse and provide forward momentum during sprinting. It involved a combination of musculoskeletal modeling and analysis of complex gait data. It identifies an important role for the plantar flexors, with the soleus contributing over 44% of the muscleinduced upward impulse required to support the body against gravity and the gastrocnemius generating 37% of the muscleinduced propulsive impulse needed to increase forward momentum at each foot contact. The hamstrings were also found to contribute significantly to sprint performance (15% of the muscleinduced propulsive impulse) by accelerating the body forward throughout the stance phase at all foot contacts. In addition, the hamstrings and the gluteus maximus were shown to be important contributors by extending the hip and decelerating the swinging leg in preparation for foot contact in the next phase. Thus, this paper provides important new information underpinning the biomechanics of sprint running performance. In addition to winning paper, the following papers from the different sections of the journal were highly commended. In Physiology & Biochemistry, the paper by Horwath and coworkers2 on the “Influence of sex and fiber type on the satellite cell pool in human skeletal muscle” identified sexbased differences in satellite cell distribution in the quadriceps muscle of 64 young biopsy donors. Unlike males, females had a lower satellite cell content in their type II compared with their type I fibers, which may well have implications for traininginduced adaptions in muscle between sexes. In Health, Disease & Physical Activity, the paper by Farrahi and colleagues3 entitled “Accumulation patterns of sedentary time and breaks and their association with cardiometabolic health markers in adults,” showed in a large cohort of over 4000 participants from Finland and using accelerometery data, that breaking up sedentary time with physical activity could modify the detrimental cardiometabolic health effects of time spent being sedentary. In Sports Medicine & Orthopaedics, the paper by SuarezArrones and coworkers4 entitled applying “Applying a holistic hamstring injury prevention approach in elite football: 12 seasons, single club study” investigated the effects of a multicomponent training program based on holistic hamstring health in elite professional soccer players based on their needs on injury prevalence. This interesting study focused on an elite club in Europe and was conducted over 12 seasons. The last 2 seasons formed the intervention period with the others acting as the control seasons. During the intervention period, players performed a complex program organized into different interventions throughout the week having as a priority the individual player's health needs. Hamstring injuries, absenteeism, injury rates, and injury burden were all improved in the intervention seasons. Finally, in the Psychology of Sport, Exercise, and Health section, a paper entitled “Applying the transcontextual model to promote sport injury prevention behaviors among secondary school students” by Lee and coworkers5 investigated the effects of an intervention based on the transcontextual model in over 1000 secondary school physical students in regard to sports injury using a 3month clusterrandomized controlled trial, with the findings supporting the use of the transcontextual model as a useful framework for developing an intervention for promoting sport injury prevention behaviors among secondary school students.

The primary driver of this effort is a 30-school randomized control trial (RCT) that is studying the impact of Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles curriculum from Code.org and The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC). Each school has each been assigned, at random, either Code.org or BJC and will use the assigned curriculum for a period of 3 years while the impact is evaluated. The 2021-2022 school year is the first year of this program. As a means of providing support to teachers and schools, a district-level computer science manager is creating and curating resources, including pacing guides, unit plans, exam reviews, and topic videos. In addition to the provider-facilitated summer trainings, the district provides a 3-day new-teacher content training, quarterly full-day course collaboration sessions, and bi-weekly one-hour support webinars, all focusing on AP Computer Science Principles. Further, four course leaders, current teachers with proven track records of success have been assigned to facilitate professional development and provide informal coaching to our cohort. The need for schools to competently implement the Code.org or BJC curriculum as part of the 30-school RCT has been the key factor in deciding the depth of support to provide for the AP CS Principles program.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3478432.3499249?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3478432.3499249, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is the most common head and neck cancer found in Indonesia. One of the factors that plays a role in the development of NPC is VEGF. VEGF is coded in VEGF gene which is very polymorphic. One of the polymorphisms in VEGF gene that influences the expression of the gene itself is VEGF-2578C/A gene polymorphism which has never been studied before in Indonesia. This research aims to study the association between VEGF-2578 gene polymorphism (clinical stadium, T stadium (tumor size), N stadium (local metastasis), M stadium (distant metastasis), and histopathological typing) of year 2021 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer in RSUP Prof. dr. I.G.N.G Ngoerah Denpasar Bali.
This research uses the cross-sectional method and was done in the Biomedical Laboratory in Udayana University Faculty of Medicine from June to December 2022. 43 samples were used in the form of DNA from stored biological specimens of nasopharyngeal cancer patients that were treated in ENT-Oncology polyclinic in RSUP Prof. dr. I.G.N.G Ngoerah in 2021. Secondary data was available from the Biomedical Laboratory in Udayana University Faculty of Medicine. To detect polymorphism from the DNA samples, gene amplification was done using PCR, confirmed using electrophoresis, and sent for sequencing in Genetika Science Jakarta.
From 43 samples, it was found that there were 36 (83,7%) CC genotip and 7 (16,3%) AA genotip. A significant association was found between VEGF-2578C/A gene polymorphism with T stadium (tumor size) with p value = 0,028. Late stage of T stadium (T3-T4) was found significantly more on subjects with CC genotip (75%) compared to AA genotip (28,6%). The effect of confounding variables which are age and gender have been minimalized. It was also found that there was no significant association between VEGF-2578C/A gene polymorphism with clinical stadium, N stadium, M stadium, or histopathological typing on the research subjects.
In conclusion, this research found that there was a significant association between VEGF-2578C/A gene polymorphism with T stadium, but not with clinical stadium, N stadium, M stadium, or histopathological typing of year 2021 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer in RSUP Prof. dr. I.G.N.G Ngoerah Denpasar Bali.

The data were collected from different published research papers through searching the web sources such as PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and other related websites. The important search terminologies included ethnobotany, respiratory diseases, medicinal plants, and Ethiopia. For this, a total of 65 articles of recent publications (from 2000 to May 2021 years) that provided full information about the use of medicinal plant species to treat respiratory disorder diseases in Ethiopia were consulted. Based on this, a total of 96 medicinal plants belonging to 57 families were reviewed. The commonly recorded families used to manage respiratory problems were Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Solanaceae, and Fabaceae. Herbs and shrubs were the dominant plant growth forms. Due to the easiest form of their preparation for treating respiratory disorders, leaves are the most cited plant parts followed by roots. Crushing and pounding are useful methods of remedy preparation to treat respiratory diseases. This review concluded that different medicinal plants have a significant contribution in combating serious respiratory problems in Ethiopia. Hence, the complied review of medicinal plants on the treatment of respiratory problems would play a great role in further pharmacological and phytochemical investigations in developing new drugs used for the treatment of respiratory problems and in the conservation of these important medicinal plants.",Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine,2022.0,17,"{'url': 'https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2022/2935015.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9252637, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Considering the extensive benefits of physical activity (PA), the literature on the PA research of ASD has increased each year, but there is a lack of bibliometric analyses in this field. To investigate the research achievements worldwide, this paper adopts bibliometrics to analyze the trend in the academic literature on the PA research of ASD published from 1980 to 2021. The documents were retrieved from the Web of Science database, and the search strategy was to combine the keywords related to “physical activity” and “autism spectrum disorder” by using the Boolean operator tools “OR” and “AND” in the title. A total of 359 English documents were retrieved. Microsoft Excel, Data Wrapper, VOSviewer, and Biblioshiny were used for the visual analysis. We found that the number of published documents increased the fastest from 2017 to 2021, which may be due to the promulgation of the Global Action Plan for Physical Activity 2018–2030 and the influence of COVID-19 on the world. The United States and the University of California systems are in the leading position in this field. Cooperation among countries with different levels of development will help to jointly promote the PA research progress on ASD. The focus themes include “individual effect”, “social support” and “activity dose”. The analysis of the frontier topic points out that researchers are paying increasing attention to how to improve the health and physical fitness of this group through PA.

However, to the knowledge of the authors, little bibliometric quantitative or qualitative analysis has been carried out to evaluate herpes zoster research. This study aimed to use a bibliometric analysis to evaluate current publication trends and hotspots on herpes zoster research worldwide, in order to advance research in this field. Methods Relevant publications from January 2012 to December 2021 were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Citespace (V5.8.R3) was used to analyze the research points, including publication countries, institutions and authors, cited author, cited reference and their clustering, and keyword co-occurrence, and burst keyword to acquire research trends and hotspots. Results A total of 9,259 publications were obtained, with a steady increase in the number of annual publications during the decade. Articles were the main type of publication. The United States is the leading country in this research, and the University of Colorado has the highest influence in this field. Oxman is the most representative author, with a main research interest in herpes zoster vaccines. The top five cited authors' publications focused on herpes zoster vaccines, molecular mechanisms, and postherpetic neuralgia. A co-citation map resulted 19 main clusters, and revealed that vaccines, postherpetic neuralgia, treatments, varicella zoster virus and its mechanisms, and epidemiology of herpes zoster were the current research focus after clustering co-cited publications. Human herpesviruses, antiviral prophylaxis, rheumatoid arthritis, recombinant zoster vaccine, varicella vaccination and postherpetic neuralgia were the top clusters after co-occurrence keywords analysis. Moreover, burst keywords detection showed that the subunit vaccine was the new hotspot in the field of herpes zoster. Conclusion This bibliometric study defined the overall prospects in the field of herpes zoster and provided valuable instruction for the ongoing research.

6432517196660e94f67520f2a6d292929894440d,“Students were just sticky notes on JamBoard”: A first‐year biology teacher's story of 2020–2021,"For decades, a student's preparation for licensure to teach has been rather standard with increased time in field placements culminating with a semester of student teaching. During the Spring 2020, this changed for preservice students scheduled to “student teach.” Due to COVID‐19, schools closed for several weeks and re‐opened online. The current wisdom on student teaching and induction is based on research conducted within an in‐person environment. Little research exists on the experiences of these teachers. Therefore, we used an exploratory, descriptive case study design to understand the 18‐month experience of one biology teacher as he navigated student teaching and his first‐year induction. Twenty‐nine conversations were conducted (recorded, transcribed, and analyzed) between March 2020 and May 2021. In addition to telling John's story, the four themes of (a) other ways became the norm, (b) no wisdom from elders, (c) I built it but they did not come, and (d) what happened to hall, bus, club, or cafeteria duty were found. We anticipate the information from this study will help educators rethink and reconstruct science teacher preparation and induction in ways that will help in a nontraditional environment.

However, resources for evaluating research trends in the treatment of wounds with PRP were limited. In this study, we aimed to make a bibliometric analysis of the literature related to PRP in the treatment of wounds and explore the research status, hotspots and frontiers in this field in recent 20 years. Studies about PRP treatment for wounds from 2002 to 2021 were retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐E) of Web of Science (WOS) database. Visualisation softwares such as VOSviewer and SCImago Graphica, and CiteSpace were used to analyse the research trends and features. A total of 1748 studies were identified in the SCI‐Expanded from 2002 to 2021. The number of publications on PRP in the treatment of wounds has shown an increasing trend, from 6 (in 2002) to 228 (in 2021). The papers published in the United States have led in times cited (14637) and H‐index (63). Though Italy was slightly lower than China in the number of publications, the H‐index and average cited (47, 28.45) were higher than that of China (38, 27.01). The strongest keyword was “fibrin” (strength = 13.07), and the longest burst duration keyword was “thrombin” (began in 2002 and ended in 2014). The largest 10 co‐citation clusters are as follows: endothelial cell proliferation (#0), regenerative medicine‐associated treatment (#1), diabetic wound healing (#2), autologous derived (#3), platelet‐rich fibrin (#4), tissue engineering (#5), regenerative potential (#6), clinical randomised trial (#7), histologic observation (#8), and wound bacteria (#9).

Methods CAOS-related research articles published in international journals from 2002 to 2021 were collected using the PubMed database and analyzed using the bibliometric method. Their publication year, journal name, corresponding author’s country name, and the number of citations of all collected articles were noted. Contents of the articles were analyzed to evaluate the time point and anatomical site at which the digital technique was applied. Further, the 20-year period was divided into two halves of 10 years each to analyze the research trends. Results A total of 639 CAOS-related articles were identified. An average of 32.0 CAOS-related articles were published annually, with an average of 20.6 and 43.3 published in the first half and second half, respectively. Of all articles, 47.6% were published in the top 10 journals, and 81.2% were written in the top 10 countries. The total numbers of citations were 11.7 and 6.3 in the first and second halves, respectively, but the average annual number of citations was higher in the second half than in the first one. Articles on application of digital techniques during surgery were 62.3% and those on pre-surgery application were 36.9%. Further, articles in the knee (39.0%), spine (28.5%), and hip and pelvis (21.5%) fields accounted for 89.0% of the total publications. But the increase in publications in the said period was highest in the fields of the hand and wrist (+1,300.0%), ankle (+466.7%), and shoulder (+366.7%). Conclusions Over the last 20 years, the publication of CAOS-related research articles in international journals has grown steadily.

76536e5295b37e856217a45fdf86ba32cdafd2df,Research Hotspots and Trend Exploration on the Clinical Translational Outcome of Simulation-Based Medical Education: A 10-Year Scientific Bibliometric Analysis From 2011 to 2021,"Background In recent decades, an increasing number of studies have focused on the clinical translational effect of simulation-based medical education (SBME). However, few scientific bibliometric studies have analyzed the research hotspots and publication trends. This study aimed to investigate research hotspots and future direction in the clinical translational outcome of SBME via bibliometrics. Method Relevant publications on the clinical translational outcomes of SBME from 2011 to 2021 were identified and retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC). Software including VOSviewer (1.6.17) and CiteSpace (5.8R3) and a platform (bibliometric.com) were employed to conduct bibliographic and visualized analysis on the literature. Results A total of 1,178 publications were enrolled. An increasing number of publications were observed in the past decades from 48 in 2011 to 175 in 2021. The United States accounted for the largest number of publications (488, 41.4%) and citations (10,432); the University of Toronto and Northwestern University were the leading institutions. Academic Medicine was the most productive journal concerning this field. McGaghie W C and Konge L were the most influential authors in this area. The hot topic of the translational outcome of SBME was divided into 3 stages, laboratory phase, individual skill improvement, and patient outcome involving both technical skills and non-technical skills. Translational research of comprehensive impact and collateral outcomes could be obtained in the future. Conclusion From the overall trend of 10 years of research, we can see that the research is roughly divided into three phases, from laboratory stage, individual skill improvement to the patient outcomes, and comprehensive impacts such as skill retention and collateral effect as cost-effectiveness is a major trend of future research. More objective evaluation measurement should be designed to assess the diverse impact and further meta-analysis and randomized controlled trials are needed to provide more clinical evidence of SBME as translational science.",Frontiers in Medicine,2022.0,8,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2021.801277/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8860229, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Although numerous basic and clinical researches on MODS have been conducted, there is still a long way to go to prevent patients from entering this stage. To our knowledge, no bibliometric analyses of MODS have been reported, this study, therefore, was conducted to reveal MODS research status and trends during 2001–2021. Methods All relevant literature covering MODS during 2001–2021 were extracted from Web of Science. An online analysis platform of literature metrology was used to analyze the publication trends. VOSviewer software was used to collect and analyze the keywords and research hotspots related to MODS. Results As of July 31, 2021, a total of 994 MODS-related articles from 2001 to 2021 were identified. The United States accounted for the largest number of publications (31.1%), followed by China and Germany, with 186 and 75 publications, respectively. Among all the institutions, the University of Pittsburgh published the most papers related to MODS (21). Critical Care Medicine published the most papers in this field (106). Professor Moore EE, who had the most citation frequency (1847), made great achievements in MODS research. Moreover, analysis of the keywords identified three MODS research hotspot clusters: “mechanism-related research,” “clinical research,” and “diagnostic research.” Conclusions The United States maintained a top position worldwide and made the most outstanding contribution in the MODS field. In terms of publication, China was next only to the United States, but there was a disproportion between the quantity of publications and citation frequency. The institution University of Pittsburgh and journal Critical Care Medicine represent the highest level of research in this field.

d0f76e529e5f115b12480b8f1ec7574bf32e341e,Novel insights in drug transporter sciences: the year 2021 in review,"Abstract On behalf of the team I am pleased to present the second annual ‘novel insights into drug transporter sciences review’ focused on peer-reviewed articles that were published in the year 2021. In compiling the articles for inclusion, preprints available in 2021 but officially published in 2022 were considered to be in scope. To support this review the contributing authors independently selected one or two articles that were thought to be impactful and of interest to the broader research community. A similar approach as published last year was adopted whereby key observations, methods and analysis of each paper is concisely summarized in the synopsis followed by a commentary highlighting the impact of the paper in understanding drug transporters’ role in drug disposition. As the goal of this review is not to provide a comprehensive overview of each paper but rather highlight important findings that are well supported by the data, the reader is encouraged to consult the original articles for additional information. Further, and keeping in line with the goals of this review, it should be noted that all authors actively contributed by writing synopsis and commentary for individual papers and no attempt was made to standardize language or writing styles. In this way, the review article is reflective of not only the diversity of the articles but also that of the contributors. I extend my thanks to the authors for their continued support and also welcome Diane Ramsden and Pallabi Mitra as contributing authors for this issue (Table 1). Table 1.

fc63fccc4b3a29251c2de8a52e7ef622c3604731,Trends in Computer-Assisted Surgery for Total Knee Arthroplasty in Germany: An Analysis Based on the Operative Procedure Classification System between 2010 to 2021,"Alignment strategies for primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have changed significantly over time with a shift towards a more individualized alignment goal. At the same time, computer-assisted surgery (CAS) has gained interest for intraoperative control and accuracy in implant positioning and limb alignment. Despite the often discussed benefits and drawbacks of robotics and navigation for TKA, the routine use of these new devices on a day-to-day basis remains obscure. Therefore, nationwide hospital billing data based on the Operation Procedure Classification System (OPS) were retrieved from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany for the period from 2010 to 2021. OPS codes for primary total knee arthroplasty (OPS code: 5-822*) were further analyzed regarding the usage of computer navigation (additional OPS code: 5-988) or robotic devices (additional OPS code: 5-987). Gender and age at the time of surgery were also assessed. The results show a total of 2,226,559 primary TKAs were implanted between 2010 and 2021, of which 2,044,914 were performed conventionally (91.84% of all TKAs). A total of 170,276 TKAs were performed using navigation technique (7.65% of all TKAs) and another 11,369 TKAs were performed using robotics (0.51% of all TKAs). For the period from 2018 to 2021, a substantial increase in robot-assisted TKA (R-TKA) was observed, with an average increase rate of 84.74% per year, while the number of navigated TKAs declined (−3.67% per year). Computer-assisted surgery, and particularly robotics for TKA, are seeing growing popularity and stepwise translation into routine clinical use in Germany, with a steep increase rate of more than 80% per year since 2018. Nevertheless, the majority of TKAs are still performed using manual instrumentation, rendering conventional TKA the currently unchanged gold standard.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,2023.0,10,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/2/549/pdf?version=1673603572', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9863460, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of visualized and systematic analysis in the literature on APS. Hence, this study sought to conduct a bibliometric analysis to identify research status and discover frontiers in the field. Methods: Articles and reviews concerning APS were acquired from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. CiteSpace, VOSviewer and a bibliometric online analysis platform were employed to conduct a visualization and knowledge-map analysis. Results: A total of 1,390 publications regarding APS were identified. Globally, Italy contributed the most publications. The University of Padua was the most productive institution. Lupus ranked first in both the most published and most co-cited journals. Savino Sciascia and Spiros Miyakis were the most prolific and most co-cited authors, respectively. “Vitamin K antagonists (VKA)” and “immunoglobulin A (IgA)” were current research foci. Burst analysis of keywords suggested that “neutrophil extracellular trap (NET),” “direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC),” “open label,” “outcome,” “hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),” and “arterial thrombosis (AT)” were significant future research frontiers. Conclusion: The scientific literature on APS has increased steadily in the past 10 years. The clinical studies on the treatment and mechanism research of APS are recognized as promising research hotspots in the domain of APS. The research status and trends of APS publications from the bibliometric perspective can provide a practical guide and important reference for subsequent studies by researchers and physicians in the domain.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,2022.0,8,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.1035229/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9664156, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a leading cause of upper extremity MSDs specially to banking workers. Hence, this paper was intended to highlight its magnitude associated factors in the study area. Methods and materials Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 13, 2021 to October 09, 2021. A total of 422 private and government owned computer user bankers were participated. Simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data were collected using Durkan’s compression test, flexion and compression test, Phalen’s test, and Tinel’s test. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to investigate the relationship between predictors and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. P-value less than 0.05 was considered to declare as a significant and Adjusted Odds Ration for strength association between risk factors and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Result Among 422 participants, the annual prevalence of CTS was 11.7%. Being smoker [AOR: 4.2; 95% CI: 1.76–10.26], having > 5-year work experience [AOR: 7.98; 95% CI: 3.7-17.33], movement repetition [AOR: 3.9; 95% CI: 1.66–9.4] and lack of ergonomics training [AOR: 5.2; 95% CI: 2.8–9.5] were independently associated risk factors to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Conclusion Carpal Tunnel Syndrome was high (11.7%) among bankers in this study area. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome was predicted by smoking, length of employment, movement repetition, and not received ergonomics training.

This study provides a detailed overview of leprosy in terms of papers, journal, language, year, citations, h-index, author keywords, institution, and country through bibliometrics. The results are as follows: (1) The publication rate has increased in recent years, and 8892 papers were obtained. Most of the publications are in English, and the subject categories are mainly focused on “Dermatology.” The “leprosy review” published the most significant number of papers on leprosy, followed by “Plos Neglected Tropical Disease” and “International Journal of Leprosy and Other Mycobacterial Diseases.” (2) Leprosy-related research was contributed to by 24,672 authors, and the ten authors with the most significant number of publications were identified. (3) The University of London (including the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine) has the highest h-index, and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz is the most productive institution. (4) Brazil, India, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands are the most productive countries, and the collaborative network reveals that they have established close cooperation with other countries. France has the highest average number of citations.

4820570ac38b1672d2ee5f7e0ceff49eefdbd323,Science-Engaged Theology Comes to San Antonio: A Report from the American Academy of Religion / Society of Biblical Literature Meeting 2021,"For those of us who attend the American Academy of Religion / Society of Biblical Literature Meeting each year, if we work in areas represented by Theology and Science, the annual Science and Religion Hospitality Event is an important fixture. It is convened and sponsored by a shifting coalition of institutions, including the International Society for Science and Religion, the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, the Institute for the Biocultural Study of Religion at Boston University, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science Program of Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion. Last year, on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, the AAR/SBL meeting took place online, so there was no reception, nor was there one this year, when we met in-person again in San Antonio. That does not spell retreat by any of the bodies traditionally involved, any more than the absence of Cambridge or Oxford University Press from the book hall means that they are pulling out of theological publishing (the absence of the latter was all the starker because the stall was set up, with the Oxford logo, but not books or people). We can hope that all of that picks up next year. The absence of the usual Hospitality Event, though, did serve to highlight the arrival of a new player in town, and of a prominent new presence in the theology and science line-up at the AAR/SBL Meeting this year, in the form of a “Science-Engaged Theology Reception”, jointly sponsored by five programmes that have received funding from the John Templeton Foundation under the “Science-Engaged Theology” (SET) banner. I first heard the phrase exactly five years earlier: the last time, indeed, that the AAR/SBL Meeting had come to San Antonio. We could not wish for a better illustration of the rise of SET to prominence today than this journey, in only five years, from a topic of conversation among a few people over an evening drink to being the occasion for the main theology and science drinks and food reception at the Meeting. The first programme to receive funding along these lines was based at St Andrews, the fruit of a proposal devised by John Perry, and implemented in collaboration with Sarah Lane Ritchie and Joanna Leidenhag. Asking him at the AAR/SBL Meeting this year what he had set out to accomplish, Perry began by hoping that the time would come when a theologian would feel no more comfortable with saying “I am a theologian, so I don’t bother myself with empirical scientific matters” than with saying “I am a theologian, so I have no interest in the Bible” or “I care nothing for history”. (His “theologian” here is likely working somewhere in a cluster around systematic, philosophical, and moral theology, and Christian in the first instance, although the paradigm is broadening out to involve the other Abrahamic faiths.) “The question for us today”, as he put it, “is not whether the theologian should use",Theology and Science,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1080/14746700.2021.2012913', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/14746700.2021.2012913?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/14746700.2021.2012913, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Examining hygiene education research and developing a vision for the future will lead to creating a roadmap for future research as well as an analysis of past research. Research on hygiene education encompasses a variety of subtopics. It is critical for future researchers and thematic studies in this area to determine if there is a pattern to these concerns that cover a wide range of topics. The purpose of this study is to examine the topic of hygiene education using bibliometric analysis. From the Scope Database, 503 records remain for bibliometric analysis. This results in an average number of 5.02 publications per year. 1973 people contributed to the study. Among the top 10, most influential sources in terms of the number of articles are four websites related to dental hygiene. The United States leads the world in both the number of publications and a total number of citations, followed by Canada and China. Most of the research was related to oral hygiene education.

The recruitment activities started in early 2021 and continued during the summer of 2021 to form Cohort 1 and during the summer of 2022 to form Cohort 2. Currently, there are 19 scholars/students in the program. 12 new students (10 Computer Science (CS) and 2 Information Systems (IS) majors) were accepted in Fall 2022 and these 12 students are forming Cohort 2. 6 students were accepted into Electrical Engineering (EE) (4), Computer Engineering (CpE) (1), and CS (1) programs in Fall 2021. 2 EE and 1 CS students entered the program in Spring 2022. Two students (both EEs) stopped out of school for mainly their personal issues. These 7 students are forming Cohort 1. So far, scholars have completed at least one entrepreneurship course, attended career fairs, met with industry mentors, and attended senior design presentation events. Some of the scholars work with faculty on research projects. Students are actively engaging with the IEEE/ACM student branches and some of the scholars took leadership positions in these organizations. The SUCCESS team is regularly collecting and analyzing feedback from scholars to ensure that the necessary improvements are implemented. Every semester, scholars’ feedback is collected through pre-, mid-, and post-surveys. These surveys provide insights into scholars’ course/program performance, career updates, and also the level of persistence toward their program of study and entrepreneurship minor.

However, to date, there have been no bibliometric analyses of the PNI field from 2017 to 2021. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research and frontier trends in the field of PNI research from a bibliometric perspective. Methods Articles and reviews on PNI from 2017 to 2021 were extracted from the Web of Science database. An online bibliometric platform, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer software were used to generate viewable views and perform co-occurrence analysis, co-citation analysis, and burst analysis. The quantitative indicators such as the number of publications, citation frequency, h-index, and impact factor of journals were analyzed by using the functions of “Create Citation Report” and “Journal Citation Reports” in Web of Science Database and Excel software. Results A total of 4,993 papers was identified. The number of annual publications in the field remained high, with an average of more than 998 publications per year. The number of citations increased year by year, with a high number of 22,272 citations in 2021. The United States and China had significant influence in the field. Johns Hopkins University, USA had a leading position in this field. JESSEN KR and JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE were the most influential authors and journals in the field, respectively. Meanwhile, we found that hot topics in the field of PNI focused on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and satellite glial cells (SGCs) for neuropathic pain relief and on combining tissue engineering techniques and controlling the repair Schwann cell phenotype to promote nerve regeneration, which are not only the focus of research now but is also forecast to be of continued focus in the future. Conclusion This is the first study to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of publications related to PNI from 2017 to 2021, whose bibliometric results can provide a reliable source for researchers to quickly understand key information in this field and identify potential research frontiers and hot directions.",Frontiers in Neurology,2022.0,26,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.872261/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9163812, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e8c6e1260882b0ecf653d4baab6c1cbdef73fe1a,Revisiting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy around the world using data from 23 countries in 2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact daily life, including health system operations, despite the availability of vaccines that are effective in greatly reducing the risks of death and severe disease. Misperceptions of COVID-19 vaccine safety, efficacy, risks, and mistrust in institutions responsible for vaccination campaigns have been reported as factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy. This study investigated COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy globally in June 2021. Nationally representative samples of 1,000 individuals from 23 countries were surveyed. Data were analyzed descriptively, and weighted multivariable logistic regressions were used to explore associations with vaccine hesitancy. Here, we show that more than three-fourths (75.2%) of the 23,000 respondents report vaccine acceptance, up from 71.5% one year earlier. Across all countries, vaccine hesitancy is associated with a lack of trust in COVID-19 vaccine safety and science, and skepticism about its efficacy. Vaccine hesitant respondents are also highly resistant to required proof of vaccination; 31.7%, 20%, 15%, and 14.8% approve requiring it for access to international travel, indoor activities, employment, and public schools, respectively. For ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaigns to succeed in improving coverage going forward, substantial challenges remain to be overcome. These include increasing vaccination among those reporting lower vaccine confidence in addition to expanding vaccine access in low- and middle-income countries.

351f3275eb2c14101feae6e7d69dcbfb56f387f1,Trends in Female Authorship in Orthopaedic Literature from 2002 to 2021,"Background: Significant gender disparity exists in orthopaedic surgery. While women have increasingly entered the field, we are short of the critical mass needed to drive change, including in authorship. This study aimed to characterize trends in authorship in peer-reviewed orthopaedic journals in the context of gender. Methods: This is a cross-sectional bibliometric study of orthopaedic journals in the United States. Articles that were indexed in the orthopaedic category of the Clarivate Journal Citation Report (JCR) and the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) were analyzed (n = 82). Journals not originating from the U.S. (n = 43) or not considered primarily orthopaedic journals (n = 13) were excluded. The 2020 impact factors (IFs) of the remaining 26 journals were recorded. The articles underwent automated data collection from PubMed for January 2002 to December 2021 using R software to collect the title, the journal, the publication year, the first and senior author names, and the country of origin. Gender was determined by Gender API (https://gender-api.com). Names with <90% accuracy were excluded. Results: Overall, 168,451 names were studied, with 85,845 and 82,606 first and senior authors, respectively. Of the first and senior authors, 13.6% and 9.9%, respectively, were female. The proportion of female first authors was significantly greater than the proportion of female senior authors. The average IF was significantly higher for male authors compared with female authors (p < 0.005). Articles with female first authors were significantly more likely to have a female senior author. Orthopaedic subspecialty journals had a smaller proportion of manuscripts authored by female first and senior authors than general journals (p < 0.0001). There were 4,451 articles written by a single author, of which 92% (4,093) were written by a man and 8% (358) were written by a woman. Over the 20-year study period, the proportion of female first authorship exhibited a significant positive trend; however, there was a non-significant increase in female senior authorship. Conclusions: Female representation in orthopaedics has been growing over the past decade. Increasing publication rates of female authors reveal steps toward positive gender equity in the field and present an opportunity for female leadership visibility, illustrating the capabilities of women in orthopaedics and encouraging more women to join the field.",Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

8a6e6872a01f502a4a25f2012fae80d0fda3dfe0,Bibliometric Analysis of Post-Stroke Pain Research Published from 2012 to 2021,"Background and Purpose Pain is one of the most common symptoms in patients after stroke. It is a distressing experience that affects patients’ quality of life, and it is highly prevalent in clinical practice. The pathogenesis mechanisms of PSP are not so clear, and there is currently a lack of effective medical treatments, hence it is necessary to establish a sufficient understanding of this disease. Limited number of studies have applied bibliometric methods to systematically analyze studies on post-stroke pain. This study aimed to systematically analyze scientific studies conducted worldwide on post-stroke pain from 2012 to 2021 to evaluate global trends in this field using a bibliometric analysis. Methods Publications related to post-stroke pain from 2012 to 2021 were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Bibliometrics Biblioshiny R-package software was used to analyze the relationship of publication year with country, institution, journals, authors, and keywords and to generate variant visual maps to show annual publications, most relevant countries, authors, sources, keywords, and top-cited articles. Results In this study, 5484 papers met the inclusion criteria. The annual growth rate of publications was 5.13%. The USA had the highest number of publications (1381, 25.2%) and citations (36,395), and the University of Toronto had the highest number of papers (156, 2.8%). “Stroke”, “management”, “pain”, “risk”, “prevalence”, “ischemic stroke”, “risk factors”, “disease”, “diagnosis” and “therapy” are the top 10 keywords. Conclusion The global research interest regarding PSP has maintained growing over the past ten years. Both central post stroke pain and hemiplegic shoulder pain are the hottest research subjects. Further investigations are needed in order to reveal the mystery of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CPSP, and high-quality well-designed trials of potential treatments of CPSP and HSP are also needed.",Journal of Pain Research,2023.0,9,"{'url': 'https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=86585', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods Three surveys were conducted on large-scale national samples of young adults aged 18-24 in 2005 (N = 1092) and 18-25 in 2010 and 2021 (N = 1005 and N = 1210, respectively). The 2005 and 2010 studies were conducted with face-to-face interviews on stratified probabilistic samples. The 2021 study was conducted by computer-assisted web-interviewing on a quota-based random sample from the largest national online panel. Results Compared with 2005 and 2010, the age at coital debut increased for both genders in 2021 (by a median of one year, to 18 years, and by a mean of half a year, to 17.5 years, in men and to 17.9 in women). In the 2005-2021 period, condom use increased by about 15% both at first intercourse (to 80%) and in consistent use (to 40% in women and 50% in men). When we controlled for basic socio-demographics, Cox and logistic regressions indicated that, for both genders, in 2005 and 2010 compared with 2021, the risks/odds were significantly higher for reporting an earlier sexual debut (adjusted hazard ratio 1.25-1.37), multiple sexual partners (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.62-3.31), and concurrent relationships (AOR 3.36-4.64), while the odds were lower for condom use at first sexual intercourse (AOR 0.24-0.46) and consistently (AOR 0.51-0.64). Conclusion Risky sexual behaviors decreased in the 2021 survey compared with the previous two waves, in both genders. Nonetheless, sexual risk-taking is still frequent among young Croatian adults.

Methods: The sampled data included North Carolina Translational and Clinical Science Institute (NC TraCS)-supported publications produced between September 2008 and March 2021. We applied measures and metrics from bibliometrics, SNA, and altmetrics to the dataset. In addition, we analyzed research topics and correlations between different metrics. Results: 1154 NC TraCS-supported publications generated over 53,560 citation counts by April 2021. The average cites per year and the relative citation ratio (RCR) mean of these publications improved from 33 and 2.26 in 2017 to 48 and 2.58 in 2021. The number of involved UNC units in the most published authors’ collaboration network increased from 7 (2017) to 10 (2021). NC TraCS-supported co-authorship involved 61 NC organizations. PlumX metrics identified articles with the highest altmetrics scores. About 96% NC TraCS-supported publications have above the average SciVal Topic Prominence Percentile; the average approximate potential to translate of the included publication was 54.2%; and 177 publications addressed health disparity issues. Bibliometric measures (e.g., citation counts, RCR) and PlumX metrics (i.e., Citations, Captures, and Social-Media) are positively correlated (p < .05).

In light of the changing incidence and mortality rates of cancer in Iran and around the world, the importance of these diseases in people’s lives, and the necessity of updating and monitoring the trend of cancer mortality, we have decided to report on the mortality trend of gastrointestinal cancers, based on crude and age-standardized rates. Method This study is a cross-sectional examination of deaths caused by gastrointestinal cancers in Babol city, Iran, between 2013 and 2021. Data was collected from the cause of death registration and classification system of Babol University of Medical Sciences. Population estimation was obtained from the latest census reports. The crude and age-standardized mortality rates and trends of the cancers were calculated. Results Overall, there were 1345 deaths from gastrointestinal cancers with an average age of 69.11 ± 14.25 years. The crude and age-standardized rates of these cancers rose from 24.1 to 20.1 per hundred thousand people in 2012 to 29.5 and 25.5 per hundred thousand people, respectively. This trend became more prevalent significantly with the increase of each decade of age for both men (P-value Trend = 0.002) and women (P-value Trend = 0.012). An analysis of gastrointestinal cancers revealed a decreasing trend for cancers of the small intestine, an increasing trend for cancers of the colon, pancreas, and gallbladder, and a stable trend for the remaining cancers over the study period. Conclusion The age-standardized rate and the number of gastrointestinal cancers is rising, highlighting the importance of preventative measures such as screening, increasing public awareness, and appropriate diagnostic methods.",BMC Gastroenterology,2024.0,8,"{'url': 'https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12876-024-03189-9', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10916231, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Recent studies have shown that much progress has been made in the research of exosomes in AIDs. However, there is no bibliometric analysis in this research field. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the knowledge structure and research hotspots of exosomes in AIDs through bibliometrics. Method Publications related to exosomes in AIDs from 2002 to 2021 were searched on the web of science core collection (WoSCC) database. VOSviewers, CiteSpace and R package “bibliometrix” were used to conduct this bibliometric analysis. Results 312 articles from 48 countries led by China and the United States were included. The number of publications related to exosomes in AIDs is increasing year by year. Central South University, Sun Yat Sen University, Tianjin Medical University and University of Pennsylvania are the main research institutions. Frontiers in immunology is the most popular journal in this field, and Journal of Immunology is the most co-cited journal. These publications come from 473 authors among which Ilias Alevizos, Qianjin Lu, Wei Wei, Jim Xiang and Ming Zhao had published the most papers and Clotilde Théry was co-cited most often. Studying the mechanism of endogenous exosomes in the occurrence and development of AIDs and the therapeutic strategy of exogenous exosomes in AIDs are the main topics in this research field. “Mesenchymal stem cells”, “microRNA”, “biomarkers”, “immunomodulation”, and “therapy” are the primary keywords of emerging research hotspots.

Population growth can cause changes in land cover such as vegetation into built-up areas and an increase in energy consumption. Changes in land cover and increased in energy consumption resulted changes in the average temperature of urban areas. This change can disrupt health and thermal comfort. Temperature changes can be analyzed using remote sensing technology by observing land surface temperature (LST). LST observations can be carried out using Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS image. Landsat-8 has ability to record data continuously and has good resolution for thermal analysis. Image data processing was performed using Google Earth Engine (GEE) due to its advantage in computing big data without the need for good computer specifications. GEE can perform time series data calculations so that the results obtained will be more numerous and better The results showed that the temperature in the city of Surabaya tends to change every year with an average temperature of 31°C. The mean LST in Surabaya City decreased significantly in 2016 by 4°C but increased again in 2017 with an increase of 1.5°C. In the following years, the LST value in the city of Surabaya continued to increase with a constant increase every year. There were more than 20 districts which have temperatures above average. Those districts were located in the center of Surabaya city extending from north to south. In the other side, the districts in the west and east of Surabaya have temperatures below average. There were 17districts experienced a decrease in temperature and 14 districts experienced an increase in temperature.

RPYS does not identify the most highly cited papers of the publication set being studied (as is usually done by bibliometric analyses in research evaluation), but instead it indicates most frequently referenced publications – each within a specific reference publication year. In this study, we propose to use the method to identify important researchers, institutions, and countries in the context of breakthrough research. To do so, we focus on research on physical modeling of Earth’s climate and the prediction of global warming as an example. Klaus Hasselmann (KH) and Syukuro Manabe (SM) were both honoured with the Nobel Prize in 2021 for their fundamental contributions to research on physical modeling of Earth’s climate and the prediction of global warming. Our results reveal that RPYS is able to identify most important researchers, institutions, and countries. In our example, all the relevant authors’ institutions are located in the United States. These institutions are either research centers of two US National Research Administrations (NASA and NOAA) or universities: the University of Arizona, Princeton University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the University of Stony Brook.

All three previous TTS shared tasks were conducted on reading datasets. However, the synthetic voices were not natural enough for spoken dialog systems where the computer must talk to the human in a conversation. Speech datasets recorded in a spontaneous environment help a TTS system to produce more natural voices in speaking style, speaking rate, intonation... Therefore, in this shared task, participants were asked to build a TTS system from a spontaneous speech dataset. This 7.5-hour dataset was collected from a channel of a famous youtuber ""Giang ơi...""and then pre-processed to build utterances and their corresponding texts. Main challenges at this task this year were: (i) inconsistency in speaking rate, intensity, stress and prosody across the dataset, (ii) background noises or mixed with other voices, and (iii) inaccurate transcripts. A total of 43 teams registered to participate in this shared task, and finally, 8 submissions were evaluated online with perceptual tests. Two types of perceptual tests were conducted: (i) MOS test for naturalness and (ii) SUS (Semantically Unpredictable Sentences) test for intelligibility. The best SUS intelligibility TTS system had a syllable error rate of 15%, while the best MOS score on dialog utterances was 3.98 over 4.54 points on a 5-point MOS scale. The prosody and speaking rate of synthetic voices were similar to the natural one. However, there were still some distorted segments and background noises in most of TTS systems, a half of which had a syllable error rate of at least 30%.",VNU Journal of Science Computer Science and Communication Engineering,2022.0,4,"{'url': 'https://jcsce.vnu.edu.vn/index.php/jcsce/article/download/358/138', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.25073/2588-1086/vnucsce.358?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.25073/2588-1086/vnucsce.358, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Though numerous studies have been reported on NoV disease, limited research has explored the publication trends in this area. As a result, the objective of this work was to fill the void by conducting a bibliometric study in publication trends on NoV studies as well as discovering the hotspots. The Web of Science central assemblage database was hunted for publications from 1991 to 2021 with “norovirus” in the heading. Microsoft Excel 2016, VOSviewer, R Bibliometrix, and Biblioshiny packages were deployed for the statistical analysis of published research articles. A total of 6021 published documents were identified in the Web of Science database for this thirty-year study period (1991–2021). The analyses disclosed that the Journal of Medical Virology was the leading journal in publications on norovirus studies with a total of 215 published articles, the Journal of Virology was the most cited document with 11,185 total citations. The United States of America (USA) has the most significant productivity in norovirus publications and is the leading country with the highest international collaboration. Analysis of top germane authors discovered that X. Jiang (135) and J. Vinje (119) were the two top relevant authors of norovirus publications. The commonly recognized funders were US and EU-based, with the US emerging as a top funder. This study reveals trends in scientific findings and academic collaborations and serves as a leading-edge model to reveal trends in global research in the field of norovirus research. This study points out the progress status and trends on NoV research. It can help researchers in the medical profession obtain a comprehensive understanding of the state of the art of NoV.

Pregnancy outcome may be influenced by the wife’s lifestyle and surgical correction within the past year 
Objectives This study aims to determine pregnancy outcome in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) on a wive with a UDT husband assessed by the wive’s life style and surgery correction before 1 year. 
Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were taken from patients who underwent Assisted Reproductive Technology at AMC Hospital, Yogyakarta. Data collection from 2018 to 2021. Samples in the unilateral and bilateral groups were 20 husbands. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test helped carry out the analyses. 
Results There was an association between infertility and UDT either unilaterally or bilaterally (p = 0.009). Most UDT husbands had a BMI in the overweight category and the average age was 28 and 29. Other factors such as the wive’s life style and surgery correction before 1 year , including smoking habit, alcohol consumption, addictive drug and hormonal drug, had no significant effect on the success of pregnancy outcome (p > 0.05). 
Conclusions Although pregnancy outcome in unilateral and bilateral UDT patients was not statistically significant, clinically, the pregnancy outcome was better in husbands with unilateral UDT by IUI than in IVF.

In order to reduce unnecessary RIs, it is essential to understand their use in mental health settings. To date, there have been few studies examining the use of RIs in child and adolescent mental health settings, with no such studies in Ireland. Aims The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence and frequency of physical restraints and seclusion and to identify any associated demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods This is a 4-year retrospective study of the use of seclusion and physical restraint in an Irish child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient unit from 2018 to 2021. Computer-based data collection sheets and patient records were retrospectively reviewed. Eating disorder and non-eating disorder samples were analysed. Results Of 499 hospital admissions from 2018 to 2021, 6% ( n  = 29) had at least one episode of seclusion and 18% ( n  = 88) had at least one episode of physical restraint. Age, gender and ethnicity were not significantly associated with rates of RI. Unemployment, prior hospitalization, involuntary legal status and longer length of stay were significantly associated with higher rates of RIs in the non-eating disorder group. Involuntary legal status was associated with higher rates of physical restraint in the eating disorder group. Patients with a diagnosis of eating disorder and psychosis had the highest prevalence of physical restraints and seclusions respectively.

This paper looks specifically at the impact of these changes to those teaching the discipline of computer science in the UK. Drawing on the quantitative and qualitative findings from a large-scale survey of the educational workforce (N=2,197) conducted in the immediate aftermath of institutional closures in March 2020 and the shift to online delivery, we report how those teaching computer science in various UK settings (n=214) show significantly more positive attitudes towards the move to online learning, teaching and assessment than those working in other disciplines; these perceptions were consistent across schools, colleges and higher education institutions. However, whilst practitioners noted the opportunities of these changes for their respective sector – especially a renewed focus on the importance of digital skills – they raised a number of generalisable concerns on the impact of this shift to online on their roles, their institutions and their sectors as a whole; for example, the impact on workload, effective pedagogy and job fragility. More specifically for computer science practitioners, curricula and qualifications, there were concerns raised regarding the ability to meaningfully deliver certain core topics such as mathematical foundations and programming, as well as the impact on various types of formal examinations and assessment. Based on the data obtained from this rapid response survey, we offer informed commentary, evaluation and recommendations for emerging learning and teaching policy and practice in the UK computer science community as we move into the 2020-2021 academic year and beyond.",UK & Ireland Computing Education Research Conference,2020.0,113,"{'url': 'https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa55012/Download/55012__17980__387760573b1f47ba8585a9e9122f579a.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3416465.3416472?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3416465.3416472, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Dense firework smoke worsens air quality and poses a health hazard to the public. In this study, we show a situation where extremely foggy meteorological conditions coincided with intense anthropogenic emissions, including fireworks, in an urban area. For the first time, the chemical composition and sources of non-refractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM1) in outdoor and indoor air were characterized in Vilnius (Lithuania) using an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and Positive Matrix Factorization for the period before the fireworks, on New Year’s Eve, and after the fireworks in 2020/2021; thus, typical changes were assessed. Due to stagnant weather conditions and increased traffic, the highest concentrations of black carbon (BC) (13.8 μg/m3) were observed before the fireworks display. The contribution of organic (Org) fraction to the total NR-PM1 mass concentration, in the comparison of the values of a typical night and New Year’s Eve (from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.), increased from 43% to 70% and from 47% to 60% in outdoor and indoor air, respectively. Biomass-burning organic aerosol (BBOA, 48% (44%)) and hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA, 35% (21%)) dominated the organic fraction indoors and outdoors, respectively. HOA was likely linked to increased traffic during the event, while BBOA may have been related to domestic heating and fireworks.",Urban Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2413-8851/8/2/54/pdf?version=1716200238', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/urbansci8020054?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/urbansci8020054, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We perform the current study to estimate the global prevalence, incidence, disease progression, and clinical outcomes of NAFLD. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane CENTRAL that screened articles in English language published from January 2000 to December 2021. NAFLD prevalence, incidence, rate of disease progression, and outcomes were calculated with the DerSimonian-Laird random effects model with arcsine transformation. Results: Our search identified 59,156 records, of which 578 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of NAFLD was 29.38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.09–30.69) regardless of the diagnostic techniques. Looking at the group in which the diagnosis was made by ultrasound exclusively, the pooled prevalence was 30.49% (95% CI 29.55–31.43). NAFLD has become more prevalent during the year 2011–2021 (31.63%, 95% CI 30.23–33.04) compared with year 2000–2010 (27.94%, 95% CI 26.23–29.69). The pooled estimation of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis prevalence was 8.26% (95% CI 1.13–21.01), 46.49% (95% CI 35.93–57.20), and 46.72% (95% CI 37.57–55.98) in general population, NAFLD patients, and severe/morbidly obese patients, respectively. Based on a total of 110,142 newly developed NAFLD patients, the pooled incident rate was estimated as 46.24 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI 43.21–49.30). In patients with NAFLD, the incident rate of hepatocellular carcinoma was 1.46 (95% CI 0.90–2.03) cases per 1000 person-years. The overall pooled estimate of NAFLD related mortality was 23.91 (95% CI 13.55–37.18) death per 1000 person-years. Conclusions: The prevalence of NAFLD is increasing globally. It is contributing to poor clinical outcomes including hepatocellular carcinoma and death. Rising awareness and urgent actions are warranted to control the NAFLD pandemic across the globe.

Objectives Our research was designed to assess the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and outcomes of treatment in children diagnosed with DKA over a span of five years in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. Methods This study retrospectively analyzed pediatric cases of diabetic ketoacidosis treated at a major pediatric center in the Mekong Delta between 2017 and 2021. Results Diabetic ketoacidosis was more common in older children aged 11 – 16 years (66.7%), and females (70%). The majority of cases had not been diagnosed with previous diabetes (60%) and no history of diabetic ketoacidosis (90%). In univariate analysis, female gender (OR, 13.0; 95% CI, 1.4 – 124.3; p=0.026), previous diabetes diagnosis (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 1.5 – 41.2; p=0.016), precipitating factors (OR, 10.1; 95% CI, 1.1 – 97.0; p=0.045), tachypnea (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.1 – 26.4; p=0.033), Kussmaul breathing (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.1 – 26.0; p=0.036), serum potassium level (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2 – 10.4; p=0.027), and anion gap (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.8 – 2.3; p=0.003) were associated factors with severe DKA. All cases in our study had a 100% survival rate. Anion gap was an independent factor associated with severe diabetic ketoacidosis after adjustment multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Female, younger age, precipitating factors, tachypnea, Kussmaul’s breathing, and relevant laboratory findings, including increased anion gap, should be considered to ensure successful management in pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis.

3b2c356811cfe8cd4b2752ef43aae58439e961a6,The association between physical activity and mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review,"Introduction The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic affected countries worldwide and has changed peoples’ lives. A reduction in physical activity and increased mental health problems were observed, mainly in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this systematic review aims to examine the association between physical activity and mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In July 2021, a search was applied to PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria included cross-sectional, prospective, and longitudinal study designs and studies published in English; outcomes included physical activity and mental health (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety, positive and negative effects, well-being). Results Thirty-one studies were included in this review. Overall, the studies suggested that higher physical activity is associated with higher well-being, quality of life as well as lower depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress, independently of age. There was no consensus for the optimal physical activity level for mitigating negative mental symptoms, neither for the frequency nor for the type of physical activity. Women were more vulnerable to mental health changes and men were more susceptive to physical activity changes. Conclusion Physical activity has been a good and effective choice to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health policies should alert for possibilities to increase physical activity during the stay-at-home order in many countries worldwide.",BMC Public Health,2022.0,143,"{'url': 'https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12889-022-12590-6', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8803575, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The main driver for reform within Scottish statistical undergraduate programs is the creation of the Scottish Qualification Authority’s Higher Applications of Mathematics course which has statistics as a core topic. The course saw R introduced into the Scottish high school curriculum for the first time from August 2021. This facilitates the need for R to be introduced into Higher Education courses at an earlier stage. In academic year 2021/22 we introduced RStudio into our first year introductory statistics class. This class is taken by students studying Mathematics, and those studying Biomedical Sciences. Both cohorts were surveyed in order to assess their anxiety and enjoyment of learning how to use R, with a goal of assessing any differences between the groups. We found that there was no association in software anxiety at the start of the class. However, as the class progressed the Mathematics students reported lower levels of anxiety compared to the Biomedical Sciences students. The Mathematics students seemed to enjoy the class more than the Biomedical Sciences students, thus, needing further investigation into enjoyment versus anxiety.",Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education,2023.0,4,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1080/26939169.2023.2190010', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/26939169.2023.2190010?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/26939169.2023.2190010, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

716d25d52a8a99a8f1cc59beef8d018788c5c0e1,Review of Jessa Lingel (2021). The Gentrification of the Internet: How to Reclaim Our Digital Freedom,"Lingel The Gentrification of the Internet: How to Reclaim Our Digital Freedom (2021) arrived on the same day as a flyer for home broadband Internet via the mobile network. The advertisement came from the multinational telecommunications company formed when Sweden’s public telephone utility was privatised in 1993. This is the same company that disconnected the copper telephone lines to my village in 2016 because they were no longer profitable. For several years, about four hundred households in the rural periphery of our municipality had no fixed access to telephony or the Internet. Free computer dongles were distributed in compensation, but they provided patchy and inconsistent connections to the 3G network. Five years later, the company is back to court us with a special offer: 100 Mb/s broadband for 499 crowns (ca €50) a month and installation for ‘mere’ 3,490 crowns (ca €350). Amortising the installation costs over three years, a basic Internet connection—one that probably couldn’t support two simultaneous Zoom calls—costs almost €60 a month. Lingel (2021: 73) reminds that in the same year that our isolated community lost its access to the fixed telephone network, ‘the United Nations declared internet access to be a basic human right, as fundamental as food, water, and freedom of movement’. Yet in the USA, and almost every other country, the ‘companies controlling the cost and speed of internet access have almost entirely escaped government regulation, meaning that they have been allowed to pursue profits rather than prioritize access to technologies that are increasingly central for everyday work and social life’.",Postdigital Science and Education,2022.0,4,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42438-021-00283-z.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782678, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium and even long-term postoperative cognitive decline, which often affects the postoperative outcome and deserves the attention of clinical anesthesiologists. There are many studies on emergence delirium, but the quantity and quality of these studies are unclear. Therefore, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of studies on emergence delirium between January 2012 and December 2021. Through the analysis of relevant literature, the research hotspots and trends of emergence delirium are understood, which can provide a reference for future research. Methods We searched the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) for original articles and reviews related to emergence delirium published between 2012 and 2021, and collected a variety of bibliographic elements, including annual publications, authors, countries/regions, institutions, journals, and keywords. Three different science-based tools (CiteSpace, VOSviewer and Bibliometrix) were used for this comprehensive analysis. Results From January 2012 to December 2021, a total of 912 emergence delirium (ED) related literature were published, including 766 original research articles and 146 review articles. The number of publications has increased every year except 2016. The United States published 203 articles, ranking first with China, followed by South Korea (95 articles).

Over the years, the proportion of women undergoing induction of labour (IOL) has been on a steady increase. The significance to obstetrics practice as well as its maternal and perinatal outcomes are sacrosanct, hence the need for its periodic review. Objective: To determine the obstetric outcomes of induction of labour. Methods: A five-year retrospective study of all cases of induction of labour at the maternity unit of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH), Nnewi, Nigeria between January 1st 2017 and 31st December 2021. The labour ward’s records were assessed to determine the total number of women who had induction of labour during the study period. Women whose case files could be not retrieved were excluded. The folder numbers of the patients were extracted and their case files retrieved from the medical records department of the hospital. The primary outcomes measures were the indications and the methods of induction of labour, while the secondary outcome measures were the mode of delivery, cause of failed induction, and the perinatal outcome. Data were obtained using proformas and analysed using statistical packages for social sciences (SPSS) version 26.0 IBM corporation. Result: A total of 3,638 deliveries were taken during the period under review and 168 patients had induction of labour giving an overall prevalence of 4.6% (46/1000 deliveries). Induction of labour was successful in 71.2% of cases. Misoprostol was used in 90.4% of cases as an induction agent. The commonest indication for induction of labour was postdate pregnancy (53.8%). Failed induction was due to fetal distress, poor progress of labour from cephalopelvic disproportion/malposition and failed cervical ripening. In about 72% of deliveries, there was good perinatal outcome, 10.3% of babies had moderate to severe asphyxia while 1.3% had neonatal death. Conclusion: Induction of labour is a safe and beneficial procedure in obstetrics.

81abb14b5fb3908b227f4480deef481511d9bb75,Advances in Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics—Invited Papers from vCHEP 2021,"Advances in computing technology and networking have been a saving grace for the world during the COVID-19 pandemic, as video conferencing and high-speed internet have made telework a huge success. Therefore, it was entirely appropriate that when the in-person meeting of Computing in High-Energy Physics (CHEP), scheduled to be in Norfolk, VA, had to be delayed for a year, that a virtual edition would be organised to take its place. Organised by CERN the 25th International Conference on Computing in High-Energy and Nuclear Physics (dubbed vCHEP) took place online from 17 to 21 May 2021 [1]. As a virtual event the organisers put a different focus on the content. Authors usually submit abstracts to the parallel sessions of the conference and plenary programme speakers are invited. This time we decided to invite papers of up to 10 pages to be submitted and chose a plenary programme from the most interesting and innovative of those. Over 200 papers were submitted, twice as many as expected, covering the R&D that is going on to tackle the huge issues of data rate and event complexity in future experiments in Nuclear and High-Energy Physics. From this array of papers, the Programme Committee had a hard job to select just 30 that would form the vCHEP plenary programme, but the outcome was a broad programme with contributions from diverse areas and experiments. Scheduling the conference also proved a challenge as participants covered 20 h of time zones, from Brisbane to Honolulu. Morning sessions, for Europe and Asia–Pacific; plus afternoon sessions, for Europe and the Americas, allowed a rich programme to fit the constraints. Almost 500 people attended the most popular session and in total more than 1100 people were registered. It was a showcase for the excellent work going on in the field, and 11 of the contributors were invited to submit their papers to this special edition of Computing and Software for Big Science for review and subsequent publication. These selections not only give a flavour of the breadth of topics addressed but also reflect the current open questions in software and computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics. One of the most popular topics addressed in this conference was the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in very broad areas of application. There were more papers submitted to that theme than any other, showing that the field is continuing to innovate in this domain. Interest in using graph neural networks for the problem of charged particle tracking was very high, with three plenary talks. In the paper selected here [2], the use of edge-classifying interaction networks is discussed in relation to high pile-up environments such as that expected at the HL-LHC, which may also be suited to constrained computing environments such as the high level trigger. In another example of machine learning [3], the ProtoDUNE detector, which is testing technologies for the next generation DUNE neutrino experiment, present how they are leveraging deep learning algorithms for denoising raw data also using graph neural networks, to improve image reconstruction in a very difficult environment of the high-occupancy TPC. Third, in preparation for the phase-II upgrade of ATLAS, the liquid–argon calorimeters must deal with a pileup of 200 overlapping p–p interactions [4]. The results of the use of neural network algorithms implemented directly in hardware on FPGAs has been shown to be in good agreement with software calculations, and with a high performance suitable for the online environment. Many other experiment codes are also being rewritten to take advantage of new architectures. IceCube are simulating photon transport in the Antarctic ice on GPUs [5] and presented detailed work on their performance analysis that led to recent significant speed-ups.

Post-digital, Post-Internet Art and Education: the Future Is All-Over","Post-digital, Post-Internet Art and Education: the Future Is All-Over (Tavin et al. 2021) was written at the beginning of 2021. As I write this review at the end of the year, how many political, social, economic, and technological changes have taken place since the book was published? And what more has happened until this moment in which you are reading this review? Software and hardware upgrades, technological advances, and their new affordances are part and parcel of our present conjuncture. But these developments are now old news. Technological change is no longer disruptive; it is regular, constant, and chaotic. These lines recognize ephemerality of technological change and signal the postdigital condition (Jandrić et al. 2018), which is a concept that lies in the heart of Postdigital Science and Education journal. The postdigital condition is also in the core of Post-digital, Post-Internet Art and Education: the Future Is All-Over (Tavin et al. 2021). The book adds an important dimension to its understanding, exploring intersections between the postdigital condition, art, and education, claiming the importance of art education and its role in transforming our postdigital reality. These intersections are explored from the position of intersubjectivity, in an exercise of collective intercreation, from multiple places and experiences. A total of nineteen authors are gathered in this book with a common objective: to explore, and make visible, the new movement defined as ‘post-Internet art education’.",Postdigital Science and Education,2022.0,6,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42438-021-00284-y.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8784225, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Signed by Director Alondra Nelson, this updated guidance eliminated the 12-month embargo period on publications arising from U.S. federal funding that had been allowed from a previous 2013 OSTP memo. Although reactions to this updated federal guidance have been plentiful, to date there has not been a detailed analysis of the publications that would fall under this new framework. The OSTP released a companion report along with the memo, but it only provided a broad estimate of total numbers affected per year. Therefore, this study seeks to more deeply investigate the characteristics of U.S. federally funded research over a 5-year period from 2017–2021 to better understand the updated guidance’s impact. It uses a manually created custom filter in the Dimensions database to return only publications that arise from U.S. federal funding. Results show that an average of 265,000 articles were published each year that acknowledge US federal funding agencies, and these research outputs are further examined by publisher, journal title, institutions, and Open Access status.

To get a comprehensive overview we assembled data from three databases: Dimensions, Web of Science (WoS), and Scopus. Our final data set consisted of 186,000 unique records. To determine the OA status of each article, this study utilized Unpaywall data, which was obtained via API. It was determined that 71.5% of all considered articles during the observed period were openly available at the time of analysis. Notably, 60.9% of the OA papers were disseminated through national journals. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the rate of OA papers was highest in the Humanities, at 89.7%, with 74.8% of papers disseminated through national communication channels. The share of OA papers published in national journals surpassed OA papers in foreign journals across all research areas except Natural Sciences. Another noteworthy finding was that Gold OA emerged as the predominant type of OA over the 10-year period of analysis.

The most attention is paid to the analysis of the materials published in the 20th century. It reconstructs the history of the development of biographical materials on the pages of the periodical edition, defines the stages and characteristic features of each of them, presents the forms of biographical publications, reveals the circle of persons engaged in studying biographies of outstanding librarians, as well as the persons who became the objects of the authors’ and editors’ attention. The scientific discipline of humanitarian cycle, biography, is discussed. The authors cite the opinions of scholars (Yu.N. Stolyarov, V.S. Kreydenko, A.N. Vaneev, I.L. Belenkiy, G.G. Silnitskii, etc.) which emphasizes the necessity and significance of studying history through biographical studies. In the 21st century the library and book community has entered with a very developed direction of historical research on biography. While before 1970 there were sporadic publications on people of the library profession, by the end of the 20th century the number of biographical materials had increased significantly. Books and monographs dedicated to librarians appeared, name conferences began to be organized, autobiographical genre began to form, memoirs “in the first person” were published. Various factual and biographical materials have been collected in the journal.During the 15-year period of publication of the collection (bulletin) “Libraries of the USSR. Work Experience” (1952—1966) it published four articles of biographical genre: on the bibliographer A.P. Sokolov; on V.I. Lenin’s elder brother A.I. Ulyanov; the writer V.G. Korolenko and his library; the librarian A.A. Pokrovsky. During the six years (1967—1972), when the collection was published under the title “Libraries of the USSR”, nine articles dedicated to individual outstanding people were published in it. In 1973 the collection was transformed into the scientific and practical journal “Soviet Bibliotekovedenie” (Soviet Library Science). During the twenty years between 1973 and 1992, 128 biographical materials were published, and 96 persons were the subject of attention. Since 1993 the journal has been published under the title “Bibliotekovedenie” (Russian Journal of Library Science). From 1993 to 2000, 59 biographical materials were published in it. Articles of autobiographical genre appeared. For the first time, the interview genre was used. Between 2001 and 2021, 298 biographical materials were published in the journal, and more than 200 persons received attention. Of these, material on 165 persons appeared for the first time.Between 1952 and 2021, a total of over 280 authors published articles of biographical genre. The librarians about whom the greatest number of materials has been published: O.S. Chubarian, N.I. Tyulina, Yu.V. Grigoriev, N.S. Kartashov, K.I. Abramov, A.A. Pokrovsky, M.Ya. Dvorkina, N.A. Rubakin, Yu.N. Stolyarov, L.B. Khavkina, etc.The materials presented in the journal may serve as a basis for further research.

1df92b7cc83a097f9e51c4fb201a066447479ef1,The Second Year with Small Science,"With this issue, we are opening the third volume of Small Science. For a young journal that aims to establish an eminent reputation in the scientific community, this is an exciting time. Even though we have seen two very successful years at this point, the challenges and demands for a modern and impactful scholarly journal are continuously increasing. For our readers and authors, we strive for the presentation of a publishing platform that adheres to the highest standards of research integrity, reproducibility, and editorial processes. At the same time, your best research deserves a maximum of accessibility and visibility, fairness during editorial evaluation and peer review, as well as speedy processing. This can only be accomplished by a consistent development of our editorial workflows journal. Thus, our team is continuously working on the improvement of technical processes and editorial policies to guarantee highest quality for the manuscripts we publish in alignment with an excellent publishing experience. Below, I would like to illustrate the most important developments within the last year. While our colleague Debora Walker unfortunately left the team in 2022, we welcome two new editors. Jiaqi Li, based in Beijing, China, and Sneha K. Rhode, based in Oxford, UK, who are already integral parts of Small Science efficiently contributing with their scientific and editorial expertise on a daily basis. More recently, José Olivera had to step down from his role as Editor-in-Chief of Small due to his wider leadership role within Wiley. Neville Compton has now taken over the role as Small’s Editor-in-Chief and as Publisher for our nanoscience portfolio including our sister journals Small Methods, Small Structures, and Nano Select. With 30 years of experience in scholarly publishing as well as various leadership roles in Wiley’s Chemistry portfolio, Neville is ideally qualified to coordinate our portfolio on a strategic level. To get an impression on our whole Small family, visit our new special collection: Best of the Small journals 2022, where outstandingmanuscripts from our journals are showcased. Based on the very positive feedback for our virtual symposium “Spotlights in Small Science” in 2021, we decided to host another event together with our sister journal Advanced Science. We were honored that highly renowned researchers Zhenan Bao (Stanford Uni., USA),Ali Khademhosseini (Terasaki Inst., Los Angeles, USA), and Hua Kuang (Jiangnan Uni., Wuxi, China) presented their results in the session “Advances in Biomedical Research” whereas Shengzhong (Frank) Liu (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China), Arumugam Manthiram (Uni. of Texas at Austin, USA), and Stefan Hecht (DWI Leibniz Inst. for Interactive Materials, Germany) talked about their outstanding research in the session “Advances in Smart Materials and Energy Research”. You can access recordings of these exceptionally interesting symposia here. Wiley-VCH editors have developed a new feature to standardize data reporting in collaboration with expert researchers: data reporting checklists. These cover sheets are now a part of our submission process for original research articles. Each checklist indicates what we consider the absolute minimum parameters that should be reported in manuscripts for a particular field of research.Data reporting checklists not only assist authors to understand data reporting expectations and guide their manuscript preparation, but also help reviewers during manuscript evaluation. Currently, we have checklists available for research involving the performance/stability of solar cells or for batteries and supercapacitors; additional checklists for other research areas are under development. In the course of the year, we will start publishing the checklists along with the Supporting Information files for accepted manuscripts. As a reviewer, you may have noticed that we introduced a new workflow in our journals. Small Science and its sister journals now notify our reviewers of the editorial decision for the manuscripts they evaluated. The other, anonymized, reviewer reports are also shared.

6fdf9a9bbb3cd304706bcb8f2b4fb7e89327439e,The Global Research of Artificial Intelligence on Prostate Cancer: A 22-Year Bibliometric Analysis,"Background With the rapid development of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used in the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of a variety of diseases, including prostate cancer. Facts have proved that AI has broad prospects in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Objective This study mainly summarizes the research on the application of artificial intelligence in the field of prostate cancer through bibliometric analysis and explores possible future research hotspots. Methods The articles and reviews regarding application of AI in prostate cancer between 1999 and 2020 were selected from Web of Science Core Collection on August 23, 2021. Microsoft Excel 2019 and GraphPad Prism 8 were applied to analyze the targeted variables. VOSviewer (version 1.6.16), Citespace (version 5.8.R2), and a widely used online bibliometric platform were used to conduct co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of countries, institutions, authors, references, and keywords in this field. Results A total of 2,749 articles were selected in this study. AI-related research on prostate cancer increased exponentially in recent years, of which the USA was the most productive country with 1,342 publications, and had close cooperation with many countries. The most productive institution and researcher were the Henry Ford Health System and Tewari. However, the cooperation among most institutions or researchers was not close even if the high research outputs. The result of keyword analysis could divide all studies into three clusters: “Diagnosis and Prediction AI-related study”, “Non-surgery AI-related study”, and “Surgery AI-related study”. Meanwhile, the current research hotspots were “deep learning” and “multiparametric MRI”. Conclusions Artificial intelligence has broad application prospects in prostate cancer, and a growing number of scholars are devoted to AI-related research on prostate cancer. Meanwhile, the cooperation among various countries and institutions needs to be strengthened in the future.

The paper is selected on the basis of that which provides new and important insights in the field of sport and exercise science and medicine, coupled with a high level of scientific rigor. The recipient of the 2022 SJMSS Paper of the Year is Kujala et al.1 for their paper entitled: “Physical activity and health: Findings from Finnish monozygotic twin pairs discordant for physical activity.” This paper, which is a hybrid of a review and an original research paper, has investigated indices of health from monozygotic twin pairs extracted from two established Finnish twin cohorts. Seventeen twin pairs were selected as being uniquely discordant in regard to their levels of physical activity. The twin pairs underwent comprehensive examinations with the aim of investigating any differences in physical fitness, body composition, vascular and metabolic risk factors, muscle and adipose tissue gene expressions, artery diameters, bone structure, as well as in brain structure and function. The findings show that the twins with higher levels of longterm physical activity had higher VO2max, reduced body fat, reduced visceral fat, reduced liver fat, increased lumen diameters of conduit arteries to the lower limbs, increased bone mineral density in loaded bone areas, and an increased number of large highdensity lipoprotein particles. By controlling for genetics in this investigation through the use of identical twins, the study provides further compelling evidence of the efficacy of longterm physical activity on health across multiple systems. In addition to the wining paper from the Health, Disease and Physical Activity section, the following papers from the other sections of the journal were highly commended. In Physiology & Biochemistry, the paper by Filipas et al.2 investigated the effects of polarized or pyramidal periodizations during a 16week training period in 60 already welltrained endurance athletes. Polarized training occurs where individuals spend more time training at both a low intensity (below the first ventilatory threshold) and a high training intensity (above the second ventilatory threshold) relative to the intermediate zone (between these two thresholds). In contrast, pyramidal training is characterized by accumulating a higher percentage of training time in the lower and middle zones with less in the highest zone. This study showed that a modification of training intensity by changing from pyramidal to polarized in the second half of the periodization induced bigger improvements in physiological (VO2peak) and performance (5-km running time trial) measures compared with the simple pyramidal and polarized regimens, or when compared to switching from polarized into pyramidal periodization. In Biomechanics and Motor Control, the paper by Van Hooren et al.3 provided new insights into muscle fascicle behavior during three different hamstring exercises (Nordic hamstring curl, singleleg Roman chair, and singleleg deadlift), by integrating a combination of fullbody kinematics, ground reaction forces, surface muscle activation, and ultrasonography of the biceps femoris. In Sports Medicine & Orthopedics, the paper by Jansrud Hammer et al.4 used videorecorded laryngoscopy performed during maximal cardiopulmonary treadmill exercise to study exerciseinduced laryngeal obstruction in 100 national and international athletes. Exerciseinduced laryngeal obstruction is often confused with exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction, but they are very different. The results support the notion that persistent exerciserelated respiratory symptoms in athletes need careful diagnostic consideration to prevent indiscriminate use or escalation of asthma treatment. Finally, in Psychology of Sport, Exercise, and Health, the paper by Taylor et al.5 used an interesting psychophysiological model to examine disturbances in the desire to reduce effort and performance goal value across moderate, heavy, and severe exercise intensity domains. The results showed that progression from the moderate through to the heavy and severe domains of exercise are points in which motivational dynamics are perturbed, particularly the desire to reduce effort.

80c8e6128471ca2fe60d66b7bc83e3a6b9c5bdde,Sustained Rise in Retractions in the Life Sciences Literature during the Pandemic Years 2020 and 2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating to all human endeavors, and scientific research has not been spared. We queried how the retraction of publications might have been affected during the pandemic years 2020–2021. Searches performed with Retraction Watch Database (RWD) revealed that the total number of retractions (as proxied by retraction-related notices) rose steadily from 2013 into the pandemic years 2020–2021. Interestingly, while retractions in the physical and social sciences tapered during 2020–2021, those of the basic life sciences and health sciences showed robust increases in 2020, with the former maintaining a steep rise in 2021. This rise in retractions belied a tapering of total relevant publications in the same year and is confirmed with a complementary search strategy in Scopus. The retraction rate in the medical sciences, particularly those relating to infectious disease, is clearly affected by the anomalous high retraction rate of COVID-19-related papers. However, the sustained increase in the retraction rate of the basic life sciences papers, could be due, at least partly, to retraction spikes in several journals. The rise in retractions in the life and medical sciences could be attributed to heightened post-publication peer review of papers in online platforms such as PubPeer, where numerous problematic papers have been revealed.",Publ.,2022.0,19,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/10/3/29/pdf?version=1660897012', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/publications10030029?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/publications10030029, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

So far, the cases of MERS-CoV have been reported in 27 countries. The virus causes severe health complications, resulting high mortality. Aim The current study aimed to evaluate the global research trends and key bibliometric indices in MERS-CoV research from 2012 to 2021. Methods A retrospective bibliometric and visualized study was conducted. The Science Citation Index Expanded Edition of Web of Science Core Collection database was utilized to retrieve published scientific literature on MERS-CoV. The retrieved publications were assessed for a number of bibliometric attributes. The data were imported into HistCiteTM and VOSviewer software to calculate the citations count and perform the visualization mapping, respectively. In addition, countries or regions collaboration, keywords analysis, and trend topics in MERS-CoV were assessed using the Bibliometrix: An R-tool. Results A total of 1,587 publications, published in 499 journals, authored by 6,506 authors from 88 countries or regions were included in the final analysis. Majority of these publications were published as research article (n = 1,143). Globally, these publications received 70,143 citations. The most frequent year of publication was 2016 (n = 253), while the most cited year was 2014 (11,517 citations). The most prolific author was Memish ZA (n = 94), while the most published journal was Emerging Infectious Diseases (n = 80). The United States of America (USA) (n = 520) and Saudi Arabia (n = 432) were the most influential and largest contributors to the MERS-CoV publications. The extensively studied research area was infectious diseases. The most frequently used author keywords other than search keywords were Saudi Arabia, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, epidemiology, transmission, spike protein, vaccine, outbreak, camel, and pneumonia. Conclusion This study provides an insight into MERS-CoV-related research for scientific community (researchers, academicians) to understand and expand the basic knowledge structure, potential collaborations, and research trend topics. This study can also be useful for policy makers. After the emergence of MERS-CoV, a significant increase in scientific production was observed in the next 4 years (2013–2016). In 2021, the trend topics in MERS-CoV-related research were COVID-19, clinical characteristics, and cytokine storm.

IRIS Slovakia 2021 on-line Bratislava, September 13-17, 2021","During the last two years, our professional as well as personal lives have been considerably influenced by the COVID 19 pandemics. This situation has required fundamental changes how to approach and maintain our activities. However, in spite of the pandemic situation we continue organizing the International Research Interdisciplinary School (IRIS) courses annually for already 16 years. This year IRIS was organized by Premedix Academy, NGO, Slovakia in collaboration with the scientific journal Heart, Vessels and Transplantation, under the patronage of the Ministry of Education, Research, Science and Sport of the Slovak Republic. Because of the persisted pandemic situation, the on-line format was used. IRIS was sponsored by Pfizer, which recognizes the need of training soft skill for young researcher. In this report, we summarize the experience from this year, benefits and limitations: related both to the topic of the course as well as to organizational aspect. The on-line format of the course allowed to invite more faculty members. The core faculty included Ljuba Bacharova (Slovakia), Gulmira Kudaiberdieva (Kyrgyzstan), Katarzyna Piotrowicz (Poland), Peter Skrak (Slovakia), Jonathan Lipton (Australia) and Eric Eisenstein (USA). The role of the core faculty was to introduce briefly individual workshops and consequently to moderate the plenary discussions. The advantage of the on-line format of the course was the possibility to invite additional supporting faculty members represented by Mustafa Inan (Turkey), Uliana Pidvalna (Ukraine), Lubica Murinova (Slovakia) and Vaclav Bacovsky (Czech Republic). They participated in a “part-time” mode, and contributed to the variety of views so needed in scientific discussions. In the year 2021, we experienced an unusually high proportion of cancelations – 64% of those who originally applied for the course. During the years 2021 and 2022, i.e. during the Covid restrictions, three IRIS courses were organized, utilizing the possibilities of online communication. The number of participants in these courses ranged from 6 to 12, what is remarkably lower compared to the in-person courses (ranging from 8 to 22). The reason declared from a few of them was professional overload due to pandemic situation in hospitals. However, we assume that it could be also due to increasing offer of various on-line courses, and additionally due to a simple tiredness and frustration from the pandemic situation. As a result, there were only 6 participants this year. They were divided into two international and interdisciplinary groups and during the course, they gradually developed research study protocols for the following projects: Act-C Com: Association of low dietary compliance and action crisis in diabetic patients type II.

34b5f54cee5de6470ad4cfd1bf89d8667ddd49ad,Nourishing Better Vision: The ARVO 2021 Mildred Weisenfeld Award Lecture,"I would like to thank the ARVO Awards Committee and the ARVO Board of Trustees for selecting me to deliver this year’s Mildred Weisenfeld Award Lecture. As a long-time member who attended my ARVO first meeting in the mid1980s when it was still in Sarasota, I am honored to provide an overview of my career in clinical and basic science vision research with a focus on nutrition and the eye. ARVO is the meeting that I look forward to the most every year, as it is the premier place to present the latest and greatest research work in vision in a casual and unpretentious atmosphere where I am always certain to meet up with mentors, students, and colleagues who have contributed to the work that I will present today. My service on the ARVO Program Planning Committee, as the Biochemistry Section’s representative on the ARVO Board of Trustees, and as an ARVO vice-president, revealed the inner workings of an extraordinarily well-run professional organization that prioritizes nurturing the careers of rising young vision researchers. Unfortunately, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) forced the cancellation of ARVO 2020, and ARVO 2021 had to be held online only. Thus, I had to deliver this year’s Weisenfeld lecture pre-recorded, with 10 minutes of live questions moderated by Dr. Michael Redmond of the National Eye Institute. Approximately 1000 participants viewed this lecture during its appointed time slot, and presumably many more have watched it on-demand since then. I look forward to seeing many of you in person again in Denver next year. Mildred Weisenfeld was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1921. She lost vision as a teenager due to retinitis pigmentosa, but she continued her education and became an energetic advocate for vision research, ultimately becoming the founder and Executive Director of Fight for Sight. I received my first competitive research grant award from Fight for Sight in 1993, so I am grateful to be able to publicly acknowledge her help in getting my career off to a good start. As a supertaster who is genetically predisposed to vehemently reject numerous “eye healthy” dark green cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, Brussel sprouts, and kale, as bitter and foul tasting, I am periodically asked why I am so passionate about ocular nutrition. First, of course, I do not avoid all vegetables, just the cruciferous one, and I am an avid fruit grower and consumer. Second, and more importantly, I have learned from my mentors and patients that nutrients that are naturally part of our daily diet can be an efficient and rational way to promote eye health and prevent or delay a variety of blinding disorders. From a basic and clinical science standpoint, my laboratory group and others have shown that underlying causes of many eye diseases logically point to nutritional mechanisms, and nutritional treatments can often have fewer side effects than pharmacological interventions. Patient compliance can be excellent, and eye healthy nutrients are often relatively low cost. These factors have led to strong and sustained patient and clinician interest in ocular nutrition as an empowering way to combat retinal disease. Through the years, I have developed a core set of principles to guide my research on ocular nutrition. I have repeatedly found it to be important to take cues from the natural world because if the eye is specifically or uniquely enriched with a nutrient, it is likely to have vital biological functions for vision. There also is a clear and logical progression of ocular nutrition research, starting with clinical observations and epidemiology to generate testable hypotheses. This is followed by laboratory-based biochemistry, physiology, and animal studies. Ultimately, it is desirable to do randomized, controlled human trials to provide reliable evidence and recommendations for clinicians to provide to their patients. This has been done for a handful of nutrients, such as the AREDS2 formulation, but these studies can be quite large, long, expensive, and challenging when dealing with free-living humans eating varied diets. The goal throughout my career has always been to provide the ophthalmology community with the best quality basic and clinical science to guide clinicians and the nutraceutical industry when they advise patients who are eager to know how they can take charge and slow, prevent, or even reverse their retinal diseases using readily available dietary or nutritional supplement interventions. In this lecture, I will focus on three key ocular-enriched nutrients: retinoids, carotenoids, and very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.",Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.63.3.13', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8934560, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d5f4e4c23f7a726f77d9eb87ca84ae355cb2020d,2021 Climate and Health Review – Uncharted Territory: Extreme Weather Events and Morbidity,"Extreme weather events (EWEs) affected health in every world region during 2021, placing the planet in “uncharted territory.” Portraying the human impacts of EWEs is part of a health frame that suggests public knowledge of these risks will spur support for needed policy change. The health frame has gained traction since the Paris COP21 (United Nations Climate Change Conference) and arguably helped to achieve modest progress at the Glasgow COP26. However, reporting rarely covers the full picture of health impacts from EWEs, instead focusing on cost of damages, mortality, and displacement. This review summarizes data for 30 major EWEs of 2021 and, based on the epidemiological literature, discusses morbidity-related exposures for four hazards that marked the year: wildfire smoke; extreme cold and power outages; extreme, precipitation-related flooding; and drought. A very large likely burden of morbidity was found, with particularly widespread exposure to risk of respiratory outcomes (including interactions with COVID-19) and mental illnesses. There is need for a well-disseminated global annual report on EWE morbidity, including affected population estimates and evolving science. In this way, the public health frame may be harnessed to bolster evidence for the broader and promising frame of “urgency and agency” for climate change action.",International Journal of Health Services,2022.0,12,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/00207314221082452?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/00207314221082452, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2930514579a2a1a80c43423f960b6ca0949204b8,Complex and yet predictable: The message of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics,"Syukuro (Suki) Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann, and Georgio Parisi were awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics. At first blush, this prize appears to recognize unrelated work in disparate fields. Even one of the Nobel Committee members acknowledged in the postannouncement press conference that it looks like a “split prize.” Upon reflection, however, there is a common thread running through the works of the awardees. Simply put, this year’s prize in physics acknowledges that disordered systems are predictable and that systems that behave chaotically can respond predictably to changes in external parameters. Earth’s climate is one such complex system, and it is of great importance to humanity. Its future must be predicted to guide policy. The prize also acknowledges that changes in the climate, like the properties of disordered condensed matter, are predictable using methods grounded in sound physics. Therefore, it is very appropriate to jointly recognize the foundational work done by these three visionary researchers with the Nobel Prize in Physics. This Nobel Prize in Physics is very different from the earlier Nobel Peace Prize awarded in 2007 to former Vice President Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which recognized the importance of human-induced climate change and the actions needed to understand and mitigate it. It is also different from the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Profs. Rowland, Molina, and Crutzen for their work on a global environmental problem arising from ozone depletion by manufactured chemicals, some of which were also major greenhouse gases. In contrast to those two earlier awards, the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics recognizes the fundamental scientific basis of climate predictability, detection of change due to known external forcings, and the predictability of disordered condensed matter. Climate scientists Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann were recognized “for the physical modelling of Earth’s climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming,” according to the Nobel citation (1). Manabe’s early work was carried out at the General Circulation Research Section of the US Weather Bureau, which later became the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. Manabe focused on “simple models” of the wellunderstood fundamental physics of radiative transfer, atmospheric dynamics, and land and ocean processes (2). These simple models could be run on the computers of the 1960s and 1970s, which were feeble compared to today’s supercomputers. Manabe’s early research showed the importance of radiation and convection for establishing the vertical structure of Syukuro Manabe.

Retirement (SHARE), namely in two subsequent SHARE Corona Surveys via computer-assisted telephone interviews: in June-August 2020 and in June-August 2021. The survey is targeted specifically at collecting data on the living situation of people who are 50 years and older during the pandemic across Europe. The objective of the research is to analyse the change observed in the respondents between 2020 and 2021, how the continuing Covid-19 crisis influenced their work and employment, their retirement decisions, and what kind of financial support and from what sources they received due to the pandemic. The situation in Latvia is examined against the background of the other Baltic States as well as other European countries. Despite the effects of the Covid-19, the levels of employment among the 50+ population remain high and do not demonstrate a trend to decline. A considerable share of the study population in Latvia received some kind of additional financial support from the government helping to mitigate the financial cost of the crisis. As concerns the changes in working time among those who remained in employment, for the absolute majority of the Baltic participants there were no changes compared to the situation one year before, as well as to the place of work.

1129212b5e20ad3ef597b6d4f8fd179852289178,Prevalence of simian malaria among macaques in Malaysia (2000–2021): A systematic review,"Background The aim of Malaysia to eliminate malaria nationwide by 2020 seems need to be prolonged. Whilst Malaysia has successfully eliminated human malaria transmission, simian malaria parasites such as Plasmodium knowlesi, P. cynomolgi, P. inui and P. cynomolgi are the emerging cause of malaria in humans. The epidemiological study of simian malaria in primates provides useful information in identifying the risk of human-macaques Plasmodium infection. Methodology/Principal findings This study was performed to gather all available data in terms of simian malaria epidemiology study among macaques in Malaysia over the last two decades. This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines to select appropriate articles as references. Data searches were performed through international databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, CrossRef, Scopus, Web of Science and Science Direct for original articles published from 2000 until 2021. The review identified seven simian malaria epidemiology studies in Malaysia over the 20-year study period. Most studies were conducted in Peninsular Malaysia (5/7; 71%) followed by East Malaysia (2/7; 29%). All studies showed positive detection of Plasmodium parasites in macaques. The most prevalent Plasmodium species in macaques was P. inui (49.27%) and the least prevalent was P. fieldi (4.76%). The prevalence of simian malaria was higher in East Malaysia compared to Peninsular Malaysia. The mono, dual and triple infection types were the most common among macaques. Conclusion/Significance The non-human primates like macaques are the reservoir of simian plasmodium in Malaysia. Hence, the study of host epidemiology is an important insight to public health management as there is a high occurrence of simian malaria in Malaysia. The right measurement can be taken as well to prevent the transmission of simian malaria from macaques to humans.",PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,2022.0,11,"{'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0010527&type=printable', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9292078, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2d6ab544cc19382c6f31bf42fbda10d1f5567c64,Bibliometric Analysis and Visualization Mapping of Anthrax Vaccine Publications from 1991 through 2021,"Purpose: This study aims to analyze and characterize anthrax vaccine-related research, key developments, global research trends, and mapping of published scientific research articles during the last three decades (1991–2021). Methods: A bibliometric and visualized study was conducted. The Web of Science Core Collection database (WoSCC) was searched using relevant keywords (“Anthrax” OR “Anthrax bacterium” OR “Bacillus anthracis” OR “Bacteridium anthracis” OR “Bacillus cereus var. Anthracis” (Topic)) AND (“Vaccine” OR “Vaccines” OR “Immunization” OR “Immunisation” OR “Immunizations” OR “Immunisations” (Topic)) with specific restrictions. The data was analyzed and plotted by using different bibliometric software and tools (HistCiteTM software, version 12.3.17, Bibliometrix: An R-tool version 3.2.1, and VOSviewer software, version 1.6.17). Results: The initial search yielded 1750 documents. After screening the titles and abstracts of the published studies, a total of 1090 articles published from 1991 to 2021 were included in the final analysis. These articles were published in 334 journals and were authored by 4567 authors from 64 countries with a collaboration index of 4.32. The annual scientific production growth rate was found to be 9.68%. The analyzed articles were cited 31335 times. The most productive year was 2006 (n = 77, 7.06%), while the most cited year was 2007 (2561 citations). The leading authors and journals in anthrax research were Rakesh Bhatnagar from Jawaharlal Nehru University, India (n = 35, 3.21%), and Vaccine (n = 1830, 16.51%), while the most cited author and journal were Arthur M. Friedlander from the United States Department of Defense (n = 2762), and Vaccine (n = 5696), respectively. The most studied recent research trend topics were lethal, double-blind, epidemiology, B surface antigen, disease, and toxin. The United States of America (USA) was the most dominant country in terms of publications, citations, corresponding author country, and global collaboration in anthrax vaccine research. The USA had the strongest collaboration with the United Kingdom (UK), China, Canada, Germany, and France. Conclusion: This is the first bibliometric study that provides a comprehensive historical overview of scientific studies. From 2006 to 2008, more than 20% of the total articles were published; however, a decrease was observed since 2013 in anthrax vaccine research. The developed countries made significant contributions to anthrax vaccine-related research, especially the USA. Among the top 10 leading authors, six authors are from the USA. The majority of the top leading institutions are also from the USA.

359c10ad2d2608e36d706267361a7844f7c37829,"Tobacco Product Use and Associated Factors Among Middle and High School Students — National Youth Tobacco Survey, United States, 2021","Problem/Condition Commercial tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States. Most tobacco product use begins during adolescence. In recent years, tobacco products have evolved to include various combusted, smokeless, and electronic products. Period Covered 2021. Description of System The National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) is an annual, cross-sectional, school-based, self-administered survey of U.S. middle school (grades 6–8) and high school (grades 9–12) students. A three-stage cluster sampling procedure is used to generate a nationally representative sample of U.S. students attending public and private schools. NYTS is the only nationally representative survey of U.S. middle and high school students that focuses exclusively on tobacco use patterns and associated factors. NYTS provides data to support the design, implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive youth tobacco use prevention and control programs and to guide tobacco regulatory activities. Since 2019, NYTS has been administered electronically via tablet computers. Because of emergency COVID-19 protocols that were in place across the United States during the 2021 NYTS fielding window (January 18–May 21, 2021), the 2021 survey was administered using a web URL to allow participation by eligible students learning under varying instructional models (in-person, distance/virtual, and hybrid). In total, 50.8% of student respondents reported completing the survey in a school building or classroom and 49.2% at home or some other place. CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed data from the 2021 NYTS to assess tobacco product use patterns and associated factors among U.S. middle and high school students. Overall, 20,413 students (out of 25,149 sampled students; student response rate: 81.2%) completed the questionnaire from 279 schools (out of 508 sampled schools; school response rate: 54.9%). The overall response rate, defined as the product of the student and school response rates, was 44.6%. The sample was weighted to represent approximately 11.97 million middle school students and 15.44 million high school students. Students with missing information about grade level were excluded from the school-level analyses (n = 135). Results In 2021, an estimated 34.0% of high school students (5.22 million) and 11.3% of middle school students (1.34 million) reported ever using a tobacco product (i.e., electronic cigarettes [e-cigarettes], cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, hookahs, pipe tobacco, heated tobacco products, nicotine pouches, and bidis [small brown cigarettes wrapped in a leaf]). Current (past 30-day) use of a tobacco product was 13.4% for high school students (2.06 million) and 4.0% for middle school students (470,000). E-cigarettes were the most commonly currently used tobacco product, cited by 11.3% of high school students (1.72 million) and 2.8% of middle school students (320,000), followed by cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, hookahs, nicotine pouches, heated tobacco products, and pipe tobacco. Current use of any tobacco product was reported by 14.2% of students identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) (versus 7.9% of heterosexual); 18.9% of students identifying as transgender (versus 8.2% of not transgender); and 14.2% of students reporting severe psychological distress (versus 5.5% with no distress). Among students who currently used each respective tobacco product, frequent use (on ≥20 days of the past 30 days) ranged from 17.2% for nicotine pouches to 39.4% for e-cigarettes. Among current users of any tobacco product, 79.1% reported using a flavored tobacco product; by product, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used flavored tobacco product. Among current users of any tobacco product, the most commonly reported source of access was from a friend (32.8%). Among students who currently used e-cigarettes, 53.7% used a disposable device, 28.7% used a prefilled/refillable pod or cartridge device, 9.0% used a tank or mod system (a system that can be customized by the user), and 8.6% did not know the device type. Among students who had ever used e-cigarettes, the most common reason for first trying them was “a friend used them” (57.8%); among current e-cigarette users, the most commonly cited reason for current use was “I am feeling anxious, stressed, or depressed” (43.4%). Among all middle and high school students, 75.2% reported past-year recognition of any antitobacco public education campaign ads. Exposure to marketing or advertising for any tobacco product was reported by 75.7% of students who had contact with an assessed potential source of tobacco product advertisements or promotions (going to a convenience store, supermarket, or gas station; using the Internet; watching television or streaming services or going to the movies; or reading newspapers or magazines). Among students who reported using social media, 73.5% had ever seen e-cigarette–related content. Among all students, perceiving “no” or “little” harm from intermittent tobacco product use was highest for e-cigarettes (16.6%) and lowest for cigarettes (9.6%). Among students who currently used any tobacco product, 27.2% had experienced cravings during the past 30 days; 19.5% reported wanting to use a tobacco product within 30 minutes of waking. Moreover, 65.3% of students who currently used tobacco products were seriously thinking about quitting the use of all products, and 60.2% had stopped using all products for ≥1 day because they were trying to quit during the past 12 months. Interpretation In 2021, approximately one in 10 U.S. middle and high school students (9.3%) had used a tobacco product during the preceding 30 days. By school level, this represented more than one in eight high school students (13.4%) and approximately one in 25 middle school students (4.0%). E-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product in 2021. Tobacco product use was higher among certain subpopulations, such as those identifying as LGB or transgender, or those reporting psychological distress. Importantly, approximately two thirds of students who currently used tobacco products were seriously thinking about quitting. However, factors that might continue to promote tobacco product use among U.S. youths, such as the availability of flavors, access to tobacco products, exposure to tobacco product marketing, and misperceptions about harm from tobacco product use, remained prevalent in 2021. Public Health Action The continued monitoring of all forms of youth tobacco product use and associated factors through surveillance efforts including NYTS is important to the development of public health policy and action at national, state, and local levels. The 2021 NYTS was successfully administered during the COVID-19 pandemic using a web URL to allow participation by eligible students learning under varying instructional models. As a result of these modifications to the fielding procedures, any comparison of results between 2021 NYTS findings with previous years, including the direct attribution of any potential changes in tobacco product use, is not possible. Parents, educators, youth advocates, and health care providers can help protect youths from the harms of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. In addition, the comprehensive and sustained implementation of evidence-based tobacco control strategies, combined with FDA’s regulation of tobacco products, is important for reducing all forms of tobacco product use among U.S. youths.",Morbidity and mortality weekly report.

Also, currently, Incurable Killer Diseases including the physical and neurological diseases of our times such as Brain, and Breast, and Lung Cancer [4–6] and Cardiovascular [7, 8], Asthma, HIV/AIDS, Dementia (e.g. Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntingdon’s and Vascular etc.), MS (Multiple Sclerosis), MD (Muscular Dystrophy), Motor Neuron Disorders such as ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease) to name a few among others, were of primary interest. These diseases’ cures as of yet non-existent, however, are still meticulously being sought by the world’s prominent institutes of epidemiologic and vaccination research centers such as CDC in USA. The goal of this Special Issue was what the ongoing global trends are, why and how to avoid the unprecedented misery triggered by diseases and disorders, and specifically, the current pandemics (SARS-CoV-2). The IJCTE has also fully encouraged scientific methodologies (via software) and technologies (via hardware) in the realm of medicinal sciences, and received original contributions such as Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Bacteriology, Genomics, Pulmonology, and Obstetrics [9], Clinical Psychology, Applied Mathematical and Statistical Sciences (Operations Research, Data Mining, Sampling, Hypothesis Testing, Estimation, Empirical Bayesian, Safety and Reliability, Game Theoretic and Neural Network and Machine and Deep Learning frameworks...) and Immunology and similar, whereas also in peripheral real disciplines addressing the core issue of Pandemics’ and Incurable Killer Diseases’ Disaster Recognition, Mobilization and Remediation and Immunization, and post COVID-19 Recalibration efforts [10] but not limited to all above options. Overall, the academic interest and eagerness toward this noble and global goal (while a relentless challenge has been announced by all nations during their SOTU-State of the Union and similar addresses at their own lands proper towards discovering vaccines to eradicate these disastrous pandemics and incurable killer diseases by the middle of the 21 century) have been phenomenal.

In this study, we performed a bibliometric analysis of CIPN-related publications to identify the key research areas and trends over the last 20 years. Methods We searched the Web of Science core collection for publications related to CIPN that were published between January 2001 and September 2021. We then performed bibliometric analysis and visualization using Microsoft Excel 2019, VOSviewer, and the Bibliometric online analysis platform (https://bibliometric.com/). Results In total, we identified 2,188 eligible publications in the field of CIPN, with an increasing trend in the annual number of publications. The United States and Italy were dominant in the CIPN field. Supportive Care in Cancer was the most productive journal. G. Cavaletti and A.A. Argyriou published the largest number of papers. Of all institutions, the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy, published the highest number of papers. Analysis of the co-occurrence of keywords revealed the specific characteristics relating to the four main clusters: oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, pain management, and quality of life (QOL). Newly emerging research focusses predominantly on neuroinflammatory mechanisms and non-pharmacological interventions for CIPN.

This study aims to identify the experiences of information technology (IT) students in learning computer programming. Specifically, the feelings towards learning programming and the challenges and difficulties encountered by IT students were determined. The researcher used a phenomenological approach to determine the commonality of lived experiences among the students. The study was conducted during the second semester of Academic Year 2020–2021. The participants were first-year students enrolled in a computer programming I course. Open-ended questions were employed to gather responses. Since the data gathering happened during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, the researcher used Google Form to collect responses. Participants were informed that the responses gathered were treated with the utmost confidentiality, security, and anonymity, following ethical research guidelines. Results revealed that participants have both positive and negative views about learning programming. As to the feelings towards learning computer programming, analysis shows that positive emotions include excitement and good happy feelings towards writing programs and finding them fun, challenging, and engaging. Negative feelings include being nervous, anxious, confused, and having difficulty learning how to write programs because it is hard. The challenges and problems encountered by IT students include difficulties relating to the program's syntax, errors and debugging processes; lesson-related; algorithm, analysis, resources, teaching, time-management, and personal factors. The researcher suggests recommendations that would improve the quality of teaching computer programming and offer new possible topics for future studies.",Path of Science,2022.0,4,"{'url': 'https://pathofscience.org/index.php/ps/article/download/1264/1042', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22178/pos.83-3?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22178/pos.83-3, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Spot A Shark USA researchers used Wildbook© photoidentification software to spot map sand tigers in images provided by recreational SCUBA divers, or collected from remotely operated vehicles, and an offshore live-streaming camera. We uniquely identified 1837 sand tigers, 101 of which were resighted on more than one date between 2005–2021. Sand tigers of both sexes and various ages were found year-round along the northern, central and southern coast. We identified shipwrecks or artificial reef sites with consistently high numbers of shark encounters reported, sometimes with seasonal occupancy patterns. Resighted sharks were often encountered at the same or nearby locations, confirming high levels of residency and site fidelity to specific locations. Together, the mating scars seen on 121 female sand tigers and 202 females documented with rotund abdomens consistent with pregnancy highlight the importance of NC waters for reproduction. We also quantified other characteristics of the sand tigers visible in the photographs including wounds, parasitic copepods, and attached fishing gear. Our results reflect the importance of habitats off the NC coast to the movement and reproductive ecology of sand tigers at multiple life history stages. Sand tiger populations have declined in the Northwest Atlantic, so information about residence at specific locations, seasonal patterns of occupancy, and sex-dependent behaviors associated with migration and reproduction are important to future management and conservation of the species.",Frontiers in Marine Science,2024.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1362703/pdf?isPublishedV2=False', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/fmars.2024.1362703?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1362703, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aimed to investigate the competence level of teachers in the implementation of an authentic learning approach. It employed a quantitative descriptive correlational design using an online survey among grade 10 junior high school science teachers and students from seven (7) private schools in Butuan City during the academic year 2021-2022. Results consistently indicated high teaching competence among science teachers in most schools; however, certain indicators such as gamification, Phet simulations, and conducting small-scale research still need to be implemented in some schools. Significant differences in competence and implementation of authentic learning approach were noted based on schools, attributed factors such as the use of learning management system, resource availability, and online training for teachers. Moreover, a significant relationship was found between the competence of teachers and the implementation of an authentic learning approach. The study also found a commendable level of proficiency in the academic performance of students. However, no significant relationship was observed between teacher competence and the implementation of an authentic learning approach to students' academic performance. These findings suggested that students cultivated a sense of independence in their learning process.

902c7980ca6704811ba79c3bdca3864ddc05bf16,Home Waste Audit: A Community Science Activity to Increase Waste Literacy and Reduce Household Waste,"The amount of household waste produced worldwide is increasing every year. In combination with other actions to reduce waste production and improve waste management, community engagement and community‐focused programs are needed to motivate the public to change their behavior in such a way that reduces their waste generation and increases the accuracy of waste sorting. It is also helpful for people to become more waste literate to empower them to be part of the solution. The Home Waste Audit (HWA) is a community science activity designed to increase waste literacy and reduce household waste. In the HWA, participants record their waste for a set period of time, research their local waste streams, and complete surveys to share perceptions of household waste habits. Here, we present data from a HWA conducted in 2021 as a case study. Before the audit, 66% of participants underestimated their weekly waste generation. Throughout the HWA, weekly waste count among households decreased by 31%. Participants found purchasing items with less/no packaging and avoiding single‐use plastics challenging. Easier changes included learning which items can/cannot be recycled and repurposing waste items. Several changes to waste habits were maintained 1 year after participation. These results demonstrate that the HWA is an effective tool for individuals to be a part of the solution by learning about local waste streams, reducing waste production, and accurately managing their household waste.",Community Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1029/2024csj000080', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1029/2024csj000080?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1029/2024csj000080, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods We searched articles related to the neuroimaging research on aphasia since Web of Science (WOS) database construction and extracted the data. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used for the country/institution analysis, journal analysis, discipline analysis, burst keyword analysis and cited-reference cluster analysis. Results Of the studies retrieved from WOS, 2922 studies that related to the neuroimaging of aphasia were screened and finally included 2799 articles for research. The United States of America and University of California San Francisco were the main countries and institutions in this field. Brain had the highest impact factor in both published and cited journals. Through the discipline and topic analysis of this field, the most common category was Neurosciences and Neurology. The keyword with the strongest citation strength was “functional connectivity,” and the recent burst keywords were “functional connectivity” and “network.” The co-citation network showed seven clusters greater than 100. Among the top 5 clusters, the most recently formed cluster, Cluster #2 (progressive supranuclear palsy), had an average year of 2017. The literature in the top 5 clusters mainly focused on 3 aspects, specifically, the discovery of language processing models, injury and recovery mechanisms of post-stroke aphasia (PSA), and diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants. Conclusion The results of this bibliometric study revealed the following three research hotspots in the neuroimaging of aphasia: clarifying the connotation of the most recognized language processing model, the dual-stream model, exploring the injury mechanism based on the dual-stream model and the recovery mechanism involving the left and right hemispheres of PSA, and determining the diagnostic criteria for PPA variants. A major research trend is to combine new neuroimaging technology, such as PET tracer technology, to realize the visual presentation of disease-specific proteins to improve the pathological diagnostic criteria of PPA variants. Accordingly, a visualized analysis of literature that uses CiteSpace provides a more rapid, repeatable and flexible method, which is more conducive to capturing research hotspots and emerging trends.",Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,2022.0,5,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2022.945160/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9334888, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In this commentary, their impacts were analyzed based on search data about citation times in the Web of Science. These publications were categorized from different standpoints and evaluated in terms of their citations, particularly in the year 2021. The thematic, contemporary, and local features of these articles, as well as the article types and publication formats, were interpreted. Results demonstrated that CDD should be loyal to the contents about drug delivery, particularly nano-drug delivery systems and nano-pharmaceutical technologies. Publications from the developing and developed countries and regions showed no remarkable differences; therefore, submissions are similarly welcomed. Research articles and review articles are the main stream of CDD. The ratio of review papers is about 30%, which is reasonable but should not be further extended.

There were some organizational and technical changes at the beginning of 2021, of which we would like to inform the readers and authors of the IJES. Changes in the IJES co-founders composition. The co-founders composition changed in March 2021: Information Agency PROK, Latvian Republic – Ukraine and Melnyk Yuriy Borysovych, Ukraine were replaced by a new co-founder Kud Aleksandr Aleksandrovich, Ukraine. Re-registration is taking place in the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine. Expansion and specification of scientific directions of the IJES. Today’s realities required combination and specification of scientific directions in the field of social and behavioral sciences the IJES is dedicated to. Such scientific directions as Social and Behavioral Sciences: Education, Economics, and Law were specified to ensure further more in-depth professional specialization of the IJES. Thus, the IJES remains a scientific periodical peer-reviewed indexed journal providing a scientific platform for presenting and discussing new trends and problems in the social and behavioral sciences. For the previous three years, the IJES was published only in two languages (English and Ukrainian). In 2021, the Editorial Council decided to publish the IJES in three languages, namely in English, Ukrainian and Russian. Changes in the format of scientific papers in the IJES. Due to the change in the number of languages in which the IJES will be published, as well as new trends, including regarding the references format (APA Style (APA 7th)), the requirements for paper format have been changed.

4e45065ab0978dbf4dcf2eccdefb59de271d08d7,Spatiotemporal Distribution of Photographic Records of Brazilian Birds Available in the WikiAves Citizen Science Database,"About four million photographic records of Brazilian birds are deposited in the WikiAves database. The objective of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of photographic records available in this database. Searches were performed in the database in 2022. Record numbers produced by citizens were obtained by selecting states and municipalities in different periods. The annual record production in Brazil has increased substantially since 2009, reaching about 400,000 records per year in 2020–2021. Most records were obtained in the Sudeste and Sul geopolitical regions. Seasonal variations in record production in the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest are comparable, with more records obtained in July–October. In Amazonia, a more substantial decrease in record production occurred between November and April. The monthly record production was more uniform in the Caatinga. When municipalities were compared, similar seasonal variation in record production was observed for four ecosystems (Amazonia, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado and Pampa). However, substantial differences were observed for municipalities in the Pantanal and the Caatinga. The results indicate that high human density, high individual income and the breeding season of birds are potential factors leading to high record production. On the other hand, heavy rainfall, flooding, remoteness and environmental harshness are pointed out as factors potentially leading to relatively fewer records. Further, this article discusses the implications of record availability for ornithological studies that use photographic records deposited in the WikiAves database.",Birds,2023.0,12,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6004/4/1/3/pdf?version=1674382457', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/birds4010003?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/birds4010003, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aims to evaluate how well the Mentimeter application engages students in science lessons. The study was carried out at Calinan National High School in the first semester of the 2021–2022 academic year. The goals of the study were met using a quasi-experimental research approach. The respondents, who were Calinan National High School Grade 11 students, were chosen by complete enumeration. The data were analyzed using percentages, the mean, and T-tests. Students in Grade 11 who received instruction either without or with Mentimeter Application Simulations often received a score of ""did not meet expectations"" on the pre-test. On the other hand, during the post-test, students who had received instruction without Mentimeter Application Simulations received a rating of ""fairly satisfactory,"" whereas those who had received instruction with Mentimeter Application Simulations received a rating of ""outstanding."" The science pre-test results of the two Grade 11 classes also showed no discernible variation. The post-test results, however, showed a substantial difference between students who received instruction with or without Mentimeter application simulations.

99198d63f519c955b668e546a5e4ad1a81194a6f,Perceptions of pre-service science teachers towards technological disasters and examination of the sources of these perceptions,"The aim of this study is to examine the perceptions of pre-service science teachers regarding technological disasters, including oil tanker accidents, nuclear accidents, fires, fuel-related poisoning, and space accidents. Additionally, efforts have indeed been made to investigate the sources from which teacher candidates acquire the foundational knowledge shaping their perceptions. The study was conducted using a case study design. Data for the study were collected during the spring semester of the 2020–2021 academic year. The study was conducted with 80 pre-service science teachers enrolled in various years of the Science Education Department across four universities in Turkey. The data for the study were obtained through a drawing test. Thematic content analysis was used in the analysis of the data. Based on the findings of the study, it can be concluded that pre-service science teachers often confuse technological disasters with natural disasters and may hold non-scientific explanations regarding technological disasters. Additionally, they tend to describe technological disasters primarily in terms of their causes and consequences. In addition, it can be stated that pre-service science teachers’ perceptions of technological disasters are significantly influenced by information obtained from mass media. It is recommended that pre-service science teachers should be given training about technological disasters, incorporating the effective use of mass media as part of these training sessions.",European Journal of Science and Mathematics Education,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30935/scimath/16182?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30935/scimath/16182, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7e360b22d8b5bb7f6b5203fbd7a7dd4277787130,Political Party Funding and Private Donations in Italy by Chiara Fiorelli. Switzerland: Palgrave Macmillan. 2021. 156p.,"Political finance is a difficult subject, both empirically and theoretically. Following the money is difficult; it takes a much greater effort to establish some basic numbers than in other areas of political science. Theoretically, political finance has often been isolated from the centre of political science and, indeed, from the centre of any other discipline. Chiara Fiorelli’s excellent book overcomes these challenges to provide us with a slew of basic data that contribute to one of the defining debates of European political science. The book provides an exhaustive analysis of private donations received by Italian parties in 1987, 1994, and 2013 and uses them to assess the extent to which Italian parties are still connected to society. So, political finance is not an explanation for the party system, as in the cartel party thesis, or a factor in corruption. Instead, the size, provenance, and destination of private donations are used as indicators of the nature of the parties, like, for example, party membership numbers or party organizational structures. The sharp changes in the nature of the Italian party system and political finance arrangements make for a rich case study. It is these changes that motivate the selection of years. 1987 is the last election year before the ‘Tangentopoli’ scandal destroyed the post-war party system and the generous system of public funding. The 1994 election was the first one of the new era and 2013 was the most recent when the research began. The early chapters discuss an impressive (and, indeed, almost frightening!) range of literature. Although some sections are almost too conscientious in referring to relevant scholarship, the main focus is on the cartel party thesis. In using private donations to assess the capability of parties to connect to society, Fiorelli introduces a concept and a measure that can potentially be used in any representative democracy. The connective capability of a party consists of diversity (the range of interests donating to the party) and intensity (the number of donations). She generates an index that insightfully compares the connective capability of the parties at any given time. Unfortunately, the way the index is constructed does not allow comparisons across time, which is a pity, given the longitudinal emphasis of the cartel thesis and much of the party literature, as well as the long and interesting time period studied in the book. Nonetheless, in future research, it should be possible to rework the index so that it is comparable across time and even has an absolute meaning. In spite of this limitation, Fiorelli makes a convincing argument that the parties’ connective capability has declined across time. Personalization is the next most important discussion in the book. Here again, the decline of the party is documented. Donations to candidates relative to donations to the party itself rise over time and undermine the coherence and autonomy of political parties. Private money in Italy appears to have favoured the likely winners, not the incumbents. It is hard to tell from this whether donors sought influence with the incoming government or instead were disinterested supporters in tune with public opinion. There did not appear to be a clear ideological bias in donations over time. However, the left tended to receive fewer, but larger, donations.",Italian Political Science Review/Rivista Italiana di Scienza Politica,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/ipo.2022.1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/ipo.2022.1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Over the past decades, continuous progress has been made in designing and optimizing the BCI system toward a high-performance, robust and ease-of-use “mind reading”. The nascent field of BCI has brought together scientists from neuroscience, computer science as well as engineers and clinicians worldwide to address the highly challenging problem. The convergence of disciplines also initiated a series of internationally prestigious BCI competitions to expedite innovation, e.g., the BCI competition I to IV and the CYBATHLON. In China, since the beginning of the new century, the technology of BCI has been developing on a fast track and has received rapidly growing attention for researchers from multiple disciplines. To facilitate multi-disciplinary academic exchange and push the BCI technology toward practical application, the first and second China BCI Competitions were held in 2010 and 2015, respectively, which were organized by Tsinghua University and supported by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC). Beyond the BCI community, the BCI competition was later opened to the general public as well as business and industry to promote the availability and accessibility of the niche BCI technology in China. As part of the World Robot Contest, this competition named BCI Controlled Robot Contest was held by a joint effort of Tsinghua University and China Electronics Society from 2017 till now, six years in a row. Very recently, the competition was endorsed by and partnered with The BCI Society, which is one of the most authoritative international organizations in the field of BCI. Since the inception of the BCI Controlled Robot Contest, tens of thousands of players have participated in this nationwide “BCI Olympic Games”. In 2021, the contest subsumed four main sections, including algorithm competition, project contest, youth outstanding paper award, and project exhibition. Specifically, the algorithm competition and project contest aimed to sift out the top-notch algorithms and the bestperformance subjects, respectively. For the algorithm competition in 2021, there were seven parallel tracks that fell into the category of four dominant BCI paradigms, i.e., steady-state visual evoked potential based BCI (SSVEP-BCI), motor imagery BCI (MI-BCI), rapid visual serial presentation based BCI (RSVP-BCI), and affective",Brain Science Advances,2022.0,4,"{'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.26599/BSA.2022.9050015', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.26599/BSA.2022.9050015?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.26599/BSA.2022.9050015, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Consequently, it was seen as an effective approach to meet the accelerated demands of the diverse student population in universities and colleges. The rapid progress of the online world has made it essential to switch from face-to-face to online space. However, first-year Science Foundation students appear to encounter challenges using various learning platforms. While the demands of the online spectrum have changed due to the advent of COVID-19, this paper aimed to assess student participation and experience while teaching online on numerous platforms including Microsoft Teams, Google Teams, Moodle, and WhatsApp. The qualitative approach was employed to obtain descriptive data which was later quantified. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to conduct interviews with a total of 120 Science Foundation students at the University of Venda in the academic year 2021 to obtain the students’ online learning experiences. The findings of this study showed that due to the variety of online platforms used in the various modules, the students are unable to interact with the lecturers since the online learning platforms were quite new and tricky to navigate through. In addition, the researchers tried to fill the gap and implement strategies for effectively engaging pedagogy on online platforms. Students’ experiences were related to poor network connectivity, computer illiteracy, difficulty adapting to the Moodle platform, intermittent home learning environment, lack of interaction, and heavy workload.

This short communication assesses marine debris baseline estimates in Indonesia before 2020 from available contributions and provides recommendations for monitoring marine debris mitigation between 2021-2025. Widely ranging model estimates of plastic debris released into seas highlight the roles of data source, the spatial resolution of models, and in situ data to provide representative baseline values. Recognizing the strengths and uncertainties of available contributions, model outputs converge on a baseline value of 0.52 ± 0.36 million tons (Mt) per year prior to 2020 in Indonesia, therefore setting a targeted reduced number of 0.16 Mt of marine debris releases in 2025. The Indonesian Institute of Sciences showed a preliminary value of plastic debris accumulation in beaches at 113.58 ± 83.88 g/m2 monthly or equivalent to 0.40 Mt/year by assuming plastic debris is most pervasive within 3 meters from Indonesia’s 99,093 km-long coastlines. It is important to distinguish that while river monitoring data informs land-based plastic debris releases, stranded beach debris represents a fraction of debris that is not present in the water column and bottom sediments. Moving forward, monitoring initiatives to mitigate marine debris should leverage on nationwide municipality-level model estimates (e.g., the source to leakage route framework of the National Plastic Action Partnership) as well as in situ river and coastal particularly but not limited to sites co-identified in previous monitoring studies (i.e., Medan, Batam-Bintan, Padang, Jakarta-Seribu Islands, Semarang, Pontianak, Bali, Lombok, Makassar, Manado, Bitung). The latter should be conducted at least seasonally, considering evidence of monsoonal variations of marine debris release and accumulation in Indonesia. Indonesia's vastness and regional diversity require coordination among stakeholders (government agencies, research institutions, universities, NGOs, citizen scientists) to monitor progress in the environments.",Marine Research in Indonesia,2020.0,18,"{'url': 'https://mri.lipi.go.id/index.php/MRI/article/download/581/399', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.14203/MRI.V45I2.581?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.14203/MRI.V45I2.581, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This review study aimed to use meta-analysis statistical techniques for assessment and correction of publication bias, exploration of heterogeneity between studies, and detailed assessment of the effect of a comprehensive set of moderators including breed, season, country, year of publication, and the interaction between composition elements. This could provide a single synthesis of the camel milk composition to warrant strong generalizability of results, examine variability between available studies, and analyze differences in camel milk composition among different exposures. Such a finding will aid future researchers and health professionals in acquiring a more precise understanding of camel milk composition and drawing more clinical implications. Six searching databases and bibliographic were used including PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Springer, EBSCOhost, Scopus, and Web of Science from January 1980 to December 2021. The DerSimonian-Laird estimator was used to create the current random-effects meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis included a total of 7298 camel milk samples from 23 countries. This review comprises 79 studies published in the English language on or after 1980, including a subgroup of 117 analyses consisting of seasons, sub-breeds, and countries. The contents of macro/micronutrients in camel milk were identified as follows: protein, 3.17%; fat, 3.47%; lactose, 4.28%; ash, 0.78%; and total solids, 11.31%; calcium, 112.93 mg/100 g; iron, 0.45 mg/100 g; potassium, 116.13 mg/100 g; magnesium, 9.65 mg/100 g; sodium, 53.10 mg/100 g; zinc, 1.68 mg/100 g; vitamin C, 5.38 mg/100 g; vitamin A, 0.36 mg/100 g; vitamin B1 ,0.05 mg/100 g; vitamin B2 , 0.13 mg/100 g; vitamin B3 , 0.51 mg/100 g; vitamin B6 , 0.09 mg/100 g; and vitamin B12 , 0.0039 mg/100 g. Our meta-regression analysis found that fat and total solids were statistically significant moderators of protein; moreover, total solids content is a statistically significant moderator of fat.

58e41a993004d2f452eee25dc5f9b05e29108cd7,Executive functions and science achievement during the five-to-seven-year shift.,"Executive functions (EF) are domain-general cognitive skills that predict foundational academic skills such as literacy and numeracy. However, less is known about the relation between EFs and science achievement. The nature of this relation might be explained by the theory of mutualism, which states that development is the result of complex and interacting processes, in which growth in one domain influences growth in another domain. The present study examined the bidirectional associations between science achievement and children's cognitive flexibility and working memory in a nationally representative sample of children in the United States (Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011 [ECLS-K:2011]; N = 18,174). Using random intercepts cross-lagged panel modeling, results revealed a heterogeneous pattern of associations between EF and science achievement, consistent with mutualism theory. Trait-like and construct stability emerged in the between-person and within-person estimates of EF and science. Cognitive flexibility and working memory in kindergarten each predicted science achievement in first grade. Science achievement at the beginning of first grade predicted cognitive flexibility at the end of first grade. There were also bidirectional associations between working memory and science achievement from the beginning to the end of the first grade year. Although effect sizes were small, findings reveal the complex interplay between EF and science achievement during early childhood and highlight a core tenet of mutualism theory-that small gains in academic and cognitive domains are positively associated with future skills and abilities within and across domains.

731bbb8041873ad336bc6c70b5cc434466f373d9,Socioscientific issues: promoting science teachers’ pedagogy on social justice,"Socioscientific issues (SSI) are problems involving the deliberate use of scientific topics that require students to engage in dialogue, discussion, and debate. The purpose of this project is to utilize issues that are personally meaningful and engaging to students, require the use of evidence-based reasoning, and provide a context for scientific information. Social justice is the pursuit of equity and fairness in society by ensuring that all individuals have opportunities to challenge and address inequalities and injustices to create a more just and equitable society for all (Killen et al. Human Development 65:257–269, 2021). By connecting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts to personally meaningful contexts, SSI can empower students to consider how STEM-based issues reflect moral principles and elements of virtue in their own lives and the world around them (Zeidler et al. Science Education 89:357–377, 2005). We employed a qualitative research design to answer the following questions: (1) In what ways, if any, did teachers help students grow their knowledge and practices on social justice through socioscientific issues? (2) In teachers’ perceptions, what components of SSI did students learn and what are their challenges? (3) In teachers’ perceptions, what are students’ stances on social justice? After completing the first year and second-year professional development programs, grades 6–12 STEM teachers were asked to complete a reflection on classroom artifacts. Teachers were asked to select student artifacts (e.g. assignments, projects, essays, videos, etc.) that they thought exemplified the students’ learning of SSI and stance on social justice. Based on 21 teacher-submitted examples of exemplar student work, we saw the following example pedagogies to engage their students on social justice: (a) making connections to real-world experiences, (b) developing a community project, (c) examining social injustice, and (d) developing an agency to influence/make changes. According to teachers, the most challenging SSI for students was elucidating their own position/solution, closely followed by employing reflective scientific skepticism. Moreover, the students exemplified reflexivity, metacognition, authentic activity, and dialogic conversation. Using SSI in classrooms allows students to tackle real-world problems, blending science and societal concerns. This approach boosts understanding of scientific concepts and their relevance to society. Identifying methods like real-world connections and examining social injustice helps integrate social justice themes into science education through SSI. Overall, SSI promotes interdisciplinary learning, critical thinking, and informed decision-making, enriching science education socially. This study highlights the value of integrating SSI in science education to engage students with social justice.",Disciplinary and Interdisciplinary Science Education Research,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1186/s43031-024-00118-4', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1186/s43031-024-00118-4?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1186/s43031-024-00118-4, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Early efforts aimed to expand CRB membership, build member capacity, and assess CRB impact. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Founded in 2021, the NC TraCS Latine CRB is an advisory group of natively Spanish-speaking, Latine North Carolinians who contract with research teams (RTs) to review Latine community-facing study materials (e.g., decision aids, scales, recruitment scripts) and provide feedback for improving or validating materials’ linguistic accuracy and cultural relevance. Bilingual staff facilitate members’ review of materials, use focus group methods to solicit feedback, and report key findings and suggested revisions to RTs. In 2023, we recruited new age-, gender-, and racially diverse members; and implemented process and impact evaluation, via (1) post surveys of RTs and (2) assessment of members’ experiences and visions for growth utilizing the Focused Conversation Method (Top-network, 2021). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Since 2021, NC TraCS has conducted 11 Latine CRB review sessions to support 7 research studies. Current CRB members (n=8) report that (1) their work effectively supports Latine inclusion in research; (2) increased group size and diversity help ensure study materials are comprehensible to heterogenous Latine populations; and (3) an hourly member compensation rate equal to the hourly rate of TraCS’ staff accurately represents member contributions. Members also cited that they value open communication, continuous improvement, communication via email and group chat, periodic programming meetings, and RT updates on study outcomes. Post-session RT surveys to date (n=3) show that RTs would recommend this program to other researchers (pending survey responses from RTs this year will provide additional impact data). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Early data highlight the value of fairly compensated, bilingually coordinated input from diverse Latine community members for improving studies’ inclusion of heterogeneous, multilingual communities.

The research was carried out in the 2020-2021 academic year when all teaching was online due to Covid-19. Students in the study sample were mostly from middle-class families. Students were divided into two groups for one semester; one received online argumentation and reflective thinking-based science teaching (experimental group) whereas the other received only online science teaching (control group). The exploratory factor analyses yielded two factors for epistemic cognition and metacognition questionnaires whereas the logical thinking test was found to be unidimensional. According to the results, experimental group students scored higher than control group students in post-test regulation of cognition and logical thinking. In addition, the experimental group developed knowledge of cognition, regulation of cognition, and logical thinking during the intervention. Although the experimental group scored higher than the control group on the set of post-test epistemic cognition factors, this significance did not appear amongst individual factors. As for the implications of this study, elements of distance learning that may have contributed to the development of students’ cognitive abilities were discussed.

Students with positive attitudes towards science courses are more likely to achieve academic success. Measuring and fostering positive attitudes is essential for effective instructional planning. This study aimed to develop a measurable scale to assess the attitudes of fourth-grade elementary school students in Northern Cyprus towards Science and Technology Courses (STC). While developing the Student Science and Technology Attitude Scale (SSTAS), the literature was reviewed, and 168 students were asked to write essays about STC. A pool of attitude items was created by analyzing the literature and essays, and expert opinions were sought. The preliminary scale was prepared based on expert consultation. The study group included 651 randomly selected fourth-grade students during the 2020-2021 academic year. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were conducted to determine SSTAS's construct validity. The results indicated that the scale is valid and reliable, comprising three dimensions. The first dimension measures students' attitudes towards the teaching process, with 13 items. The second dimension assesses students' negative attitudes, including five items. The third dimension evaluates students' attitudes towards experiments, containing five items.

b7beb9e287b98ae6c8b10dddb312f430d9756601,An 11-year record of XCO2 estimates derived from GOSAT measurements using the NASA ACOS version 9 retrieval algorithm,"Abstract. The Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation – Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) on the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) has been returning data since April 2009. The version 9 (v9) Atmospheric Carbon Observations from Space (ACOS) Level 2 Full Physics (L2FP) retrieval algorithm (Kiel et al., 2019) was used to derive estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) dry air mole fraction (XCO2) from the TANSO-FTS measurements collected over its first 11 years of operation. The bias correction and quality filtering of the L2FP XCO2 product were evaluated using estimates derived from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) as well as values simulated from a suite of global atmospheric inversion systems (models) which do not assimilate satellite-derived CO2. In addition, the v9 ACOS GOSAT XCO2 results were compared with collocated XCO2 estimates derived from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), using the version 10 (v10) ACOS L2FP algorithm. These tests indicate that the v9 ACOS GOSAT XCO2 product has improved throughput, scatter, and bias, when compared to the earlier v7.3 ACOS GOSAT product, which extended through mid 2016. Of the 37 million soundings collected by GOSAT through June 2020, approximately 20 % were selected for processing by the v9 L2FP algorithm after screening for clouds and other artifacts. After post-processing, 5.4 % of the soundings (2×106 out of 37×106) were assigned a “good” XCO2 quality flag, as compared to 3.9 % in v7.3 (<1 ×106 out of 24×106). After quality filtering and bias correction, the differences in XCO2 between ACOS GOSAT v9 and both TCCON and models have a scatter (1σ) of approximately 1 ppm for ocean-glint observations and 1 to 1.5 ppm for land observations. Global mean biases against TCCON and models are less than approximately 0.2 ppm. Seasonal mean biases relative to the v10 OCO-2 XCO2 product are of the order of 0.1 ppm for observations over land. However, for ocean-glint observations, seasonal mean biases relative to OCO-2 range from 0.2 to 0.6 ppm, with substantial variation in time and latitude. The ACOS GOSAT v9 XCO2 data are available on the NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES-DISC)
in both the per-orbit full format
(https://doi.org/10.5067/OSGTIL9OV0PN, OCO-2 Science Team et al., 2019b)
and in the per-day lite format
(https://doi.org/10.5067/VWSABTO7ZII4, OCO-2 Science Team et al., 2019a).
In addition, a new set of monthly super-lite files, containing only the most essential variables for each satellite observation, has been generated to provide entry level users with a light-weight satellite product for initial exploration (CaltechDATA, https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.2178, Eldering, 2021).
The v9 ACOS Data User's Guide (DUG) describes best-use practices for the GOSAT data (O'Dell et al., 2020). The GOSAT v9 data set should be especially useful for studies of carbon cycle phenomena that span a full decade or more and may serve as a useful complement to the shorter OCO-2 v10 data set, which begins in September 2014.

d09e03adf1c7b46e4c8ccae7da691ac1e8008413,Student-Led Curricular Development in the Biomedical Science Master’s Program Using Virtual Dissection,"The Anatomage table is a virtual dissection technology increasingly used to supplement anatomy education while its efficacy and integration is still being evaluated. To address the gap in student curricular leadership in such technological integration, previous master’s and current medical students led a curricular development effort to design, create, and incorporate hands-on Anatomage learning activities into a master’s level anatomy course during the 2021–2022 academic year. To assess changing perspectives regarding the table’s role in curriculum integration and content retention, surveys were conducted before and after voluntary participants completed the learning activities. Overall, participants had a more positive perspective on the integration of the Anatomage table into the curriculum and its use to retain material compared to non-participants. Participants were significantly more likely to feel motivated to learn anatomy while interacting with the table. Compared to peers who only experienced the table in didactic lecture, activity participants were significantly more likely to perceive that the table helped them learn the skeletal system, a perception supported by significantly higher scores on skeletal anatomy exam questions. Less positive perspectives were observed overall for the muscular system, demonstrating the efficacy of the table varied with content. This research contributes to our understanding of virtual technology in anatomy education, and, although the integration of student-developed activities was complex, various educational features and pedagogical approaches were successfully utilized to establish a novel supplemental resource that contributes to multimodal learning and an academic foundation that prepares learners for their future careers in biomedical sciences and medicine.",The journal of the International Association of Medical Science Educators : JIAMSE,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40670-023-01935-4.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10948688, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6641fec2a87ef540f62f9e3c82b3be0fbc3cf423,Political Science after the Insurrection: Teaching about Democratic Backsliding in US Classrooms,"Abstract In the context of a deeply polarized electorate, venturing into analysis of current events in the Political Science classroom can be fraught, especially regarding the quality of democracy. We argue that we have a responsibility to give students the tools to engage with the current moment of democratic tension, including questions of the quality and sustainability of democracy in ways that link with current events. The 2020–2021 academic year threw the urgency of this task into sharp relief. In this paper, we suggest a series of classroom interventions–in information literacy, conceptualization, and losers’ consent–which can help students leverage social science research skills to analyze current events without falling into undesirably heated partisan discussion. We argue that this suite of activities, which can be deployed throughout a semester, either as structured or on-the-fly interventions, can serve as a toolkit for instructors to engage their students’ pressing questions while maintaining an appropriately analytic lens.",Journal of Political Science Education,2023.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/15512169.2023.2177547?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/15512169.2023.2177547, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f08213f8839663bb5b197d4ac23afc20b842014a,29th NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC PRACTICAL CONFERENCE “NATURAL SCIENCE EDUCATION IN A COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL – 2023”: CONFERENCE REVIEW,"This year, the scientific conference ""Natural Science Education in a Comprehensive School - 2023"" was held in its usual format. It is worth mentioning that during the Covid-19 pandemic, three conferences were held remotely, in 2020, 2021 and 2022.
This two-day conference focused on science and technology education, which is a recent priority in society. There is a need to improve the teaching of science subjects and technology at all levels of general education. Particular attention should be paid to early science education. Ensuring adequate science and technology education means providing children with an education that teaches them to reason, think logically, explore, be creative and active. 
The plenary session of the conference was international and very interesting. A total of four keynote speeches were presented during this session. It is clear that the Plenary ""bridged"" different continents - Africa, Latin America, Europe. Professor Andris Broks discussed systemic issues in science and technology education, with a particular focus on the major challenges and changes of the present. Speakers from South Africa and Brazil shared their experiences in organising research activities for future teachers. Experiences from both countries in the training of science teachers were explored. The plenary also discussed developments in science education in the updated General Curricula in Lithuania. 
Informal discussions at the conference focused on educational experiences during the pandemic. All participants acknowledged that education in a pandemic is significantly more difficult. This is especially true for various non-formal education activities, or activities that take place outside the regular classroom (e.g. various project activities, research activities, etc.).
Participants, especially those who are more or less regular attendees, stressed the importance of a ""live"" meeting. After all, informal communication has the main purpose of enabling a person to understand and be understood. This cannot be achieved in an online (remote) conference. It was hoped that the work of the conference would continue.
Most conference reports were presented in the form of articles and published in the conference proceedings. One can find full texts in the database at: https://oaji.net/journal-archive-stats.html?number=1984&year=2023&issue=20002

0609a0d28e8411cd63f9eb2703b34071b6a19b8f,Financial Literacy of 12th Grade Science High School Students,"Financial literacy plays a pivotal role in shaping an individual’s financial security and overall success. Moreover, acquiring financial literacy is crucial for young people, as it equips them with the skills needed to autonomously and effectively manage financial matters in their future. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the extent of financial literacy among 70 Grade 12 students during the School Year 2021-2022 at the Philippine Science High School-Ilocos Region Campus. To achieve this, a mixed methods research approach was employed, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative analyses. To collect data, an online survey, consisting of a financial literacy questionnaire, was administered through Messenger and Google Forms. The data obtained were subjected to various analytical methods, including content analysis, mean and percentage calculations, Likert scales, and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) with the Wilks’ test. The results unveiled that the students possess a satisfactory level of knowledge and confidence when it comes to financial matters and transactions. Furthermore, the outcomes of the MANOVA analysis indicated that there is no significant overall correlation between the students’ gender and their scholarship categorization concerning their financial literacy levels. It is recommended that future studies consider increasing the sample size and adjusting the sampling methodology to enhance the precision of the results, particularly in investigating the potential links between scholarship categorization, gender, and students’ financial literacy levels.

b0551ff95ee7f843afd8b894d97fe1ccb39f5c05,Integration of Virtual Laboratories in eLearning: Enhancing Science Education amidst COVID-19 Pandemic,"It is evident that education must continue despite the health crisis that the success of virtual laboratories during the new normal education presents a significant challenge for both instructors and students. The study determined the experiences of eight Bachelor of Secondary Education major in Science students of the Bukidnon State University, College of Education, in virtual laboratory activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic during the academic year 2020-2021. Since the focus of this qualitative action research is on learners' experiences in science-related activities, Husserl's descriptive phenomenological research approach was employed. The open-ended questions were taken from Reece's (2015) study and adjusted accordingly. Interviews were conducted using an online platform to gather data. To draw conclusions about the learning experiences that the students had while participating in the virtual laboratory, the researchers used qualitative descriptions that made use of themes and frames to examine the students' responses. Six overarching themes emerged from the data, including learner autonomy, the need for preparation for lab activities, evidence of student learning, presentation, teamwork, and a desire to learn science. Furthermore, a virtual laboratory saves money and time for both teachers and students while also being safe and offering an alternate place. It gives students a ton of opportunities to explore online simulations. To bridge the learning gaps left by the pandemic and create a suitable learning environment for students, virtual laboratory integration is a calculated approach. As a result, it provides a positive and adaptable learning environment that helped students understand the significance of science and technology and how crucial it is to create a safer community.",International journal of science and management studies,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.51386/25815946/ijsms-v6i6p102', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.51386/25815946/ijsms-v6i6p102?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.51386/25815946/ijsms-v6i6p102, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The research was carried out with 32 teacher candidates studying at Sakarya University Faculty of Education, Department of Science Education in the 2021-2022 academic year. The Word Association Test was used as a data collection tool, and the key concepts of ""environment"" and ""environmental problems"" were given to the students and the students were made to make associations about these concepts. Then, the students were asked to make a sentence about the concepts of environment and environmental problems. Content analysis method was used in the analysis of the data obtained, and in this context, categories and codes were created for the answers given to the Word Association Test. The results regarding the key concept of ""environment"" were evaluated under five main themes: ""ecosystem elements"", ""ecosystem types"", ""ecological concepts"", ""environmental problems"" and ""feelings and thoughts"". The theme of ecosystem elements; the theme of “living elements”, “non-living elements” and ecosystem varieties; “natural ecosystems” were examined under the sub-themes “artificial ecosystems”. It can be said that the pre-service teachers who participated in the research have knowledge structures about the environment in general. However, pre-service teachers' perceptions of the living environment show more diversity than their perceptions of the inanimate environment. It was observed that the number of answers regarding inanimate objects was low. Likewise, while making sentences about the environment, they mentioned inanimate objects very little. Other evocative words are ecological concepts that are quite numerous and varied. They also associated it with environmental problems. In addition to these, there are answers such as ""we should be sensitive and conscious of the environment, we should protect it,"" in the perceptions of teacher candidates. It is important to have these in their perceptions, that is, to associate their feelings and thoughts with the environment. When the evaluation is made on the concepts that are associated rather than the number of answers given by the pre-service teachers, it has been revealed that they do not have a sufficient level of environmental perception. Student associations towards environmental problems; It has been expressed under the themes of ""types of environmental problems"", ""reasons of environmental problems"" and ""results of environmental problems"", and it has been determined that the connotations of pre-service teachers are gathered under the theme of ""reasons of environmental problems"". In their sentences, they talked more about the causes and consequences of environmental problems. It was determined that pre-service teachers made associations and formed sentences by addressing environmental problems more locally. As a result of the study, it was determined that the perceptions of the teacher candidates about the environment and environmental problems were not at a sufficient level and necessary suggestions were made in this regard.",SOCIAL SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL,2023.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31567/ssd.1074?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31567/ssd.1074, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

KJR published a total of 35 articles on COVID-19 in 2020 at the time of writing this article (early December), which is a substantial number compared to the number of articles it publishes each year (generally fewer than 200). We are confident that the shift was the right decision, given the importance of rapidly sharing relevant scientific information during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Of the articles on COVID-19 that KJR published, 10 were original research studies [4-13], all of which have already been cited by other peer-reviewed scientific journals, not to mention the high number of views and downloads. One paper has been cited 347 times [13], according to Google Scholar at the time of writing this article. Such an extraordinary response by the readers and researchers proves that KJR’s emphasis on the rapid publication of articles on COVID-19 wellserved the journal’s mission of propagating knowledge on radiologic imaging and related sciences. KJR has also published multiple case reports on COVID-19 for the same reason. The decision to publish case reports was exceptional as KJR had stopped publishing case reports for several years. In 2021, we expect the number of COVID-19 articles to gradually shrink as, hopefully, the pandemic has become increasingly under control following the introduction of vaccines and other public health measures. Also, we have a better understanding of the virus and the disease now than during the early periods of the pandemic. Besides COVID-19, in 2021, we anticipate that studies on artificial intelligence (AI) and various image-based modeling for diagnosis and the prediction of outcomes of patients, such as radiomics, will continue to be big themes in radiological research. KJR encourages authors to move forward to investigate how those models perform in real-world practice and how they affect patient care instead of merely building and testing models within limited experimental settings. Studies on these topics are often difficult for readers and reviewers alike because of the complexity of the subject matter and the suboptimal organization and presentation of the research report [14]. KJR will pay more attention to the quality of reporting in such studies. Some guidance materials already exist [15-17]. We encourage investigators wishing to submit their research to KJR to consider these directions. More comprehensive specific reporting guidelines, most notably AIand machine learning-specific extensions to the STARD statement (STARD-AI) and TRIPOD statement (TRIPOD-ML), are under development [18, 19]. We will immediately provide readers with the necessary information when these guidelines are released. KJR occasionally published pertinent methodologic guides [20]. We plan to continue publishing such articles.

607eba812b7c284ca22ab55bd40f9958a83f538d,8 A decade of excellence and impact: The UCLA Clinical And Translational Science Institute – Research Associates Program (CTSI-RAP),"Objectives/Goals: The impact of the program on alumni students was measured in a 2023 survey, which assessed key factors and student perspectives on motivation to apply/remain in the program, their engagement activities, how they used the skills acquired in RAP upon graduating, and if they were currently serving in a health profession and/or clinical research. Methods/Study Population: Survey questions were based upon specific components of CTSI-RAP that make it unique. Covered topics related to motivation for participation, meaningful experiences, program effectiveness, future use of RAP knowledge/training, and current career roles in the health professions and/or clinical research. The survey was built and analyzed in REDCap and deployed May–July 2023. The study received exempt certification from the IRB. The survey was sent to 123 alumni from the 2013 to 2021 cohorts. Bounced e-mails were followed up on and two reminder e-mails were sent to initial non-responders. Identifiable demographic information was separated from program evaluation questions for analysis. A subanalysis was performed to determine program impact on students who identified as underserved or disadvantaged. Results/Anticipated Results: Respondents included 82/123 (66.7%) alumni. The survey took approximately 15 minutes. Most of the students 64/82 (78.0%) had 1 year or less research experience. The top three motivating factors for joining the RAP program were gaining clinical research experience, exposure to healthcare settings, and interest in pursuing a healthcare related career. Most alumni rated the overall effectiveness of the RAP program as very or somewhat valuable and the majority felt that the program ranked high or very high among their undergraduate experiences. The program was very influential or influential in defining their long-term plans and goals. Just under half felt that their career aspirations were changed or influenced by the program, which was especially true for those who identified as underserved/disadvantaged. Discussion/Significance of Impact: CTSI-RAP alumni highly value their experience in the program. They have benefitted professionally and are motivated to keep their connection to the program alive. With a decade of clinical research excellence and programming, CTSI-RAP’s impact is well established as a proven model benefiting both students and the clinical research infrastructure.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.700', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/cts.2024.700?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.700, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

019e7dfecc660de9bd4bd36eaad81318184e95c4,Updated Guidance on the Reporting of Race and Ethnicity in Medical and Science Journals,"The language used to describe study participants in the medical literature is of paramount importance. The objective is to use the terms that people use to describe themselves while also being sensitive and consistent, supporting diversity, and conveying respect. It is also important to medical editors that a style guide reflects their responsibilities and need for clear guidance. To this end, the AMA Manual of Style committee reassessed our guidance on race and ethnicity soon after its release in February 2020 because we realized that our guidance already needed to be updated. We started with some small steps, like deciding to capitalize all racial and ethnic categories including Black and White, and then ended up dismantling the entire section in our quest to develop more robust, comprehensive, and thoughtful guidance. After almost a year of research, updates, external review, and further revision, we published our efforts to garner public feedback, which was successful and led to further revision and review. When we were confident that our guidance met our objectives, we published our revision in August 2021. Our updates include definitions of commonly used terms associated with race and ethnicity, concerns and controversies in health care and research, racial and ethnic collective term usage, alphabetization of racial and ethnic categories, and geographic origin and regionalization considerations, and we provide examples to help guide authors and editors.

d5d94cbe1b4e88b38c5a85e0e8f7e787feade916,The utility of high-dosage experiments in everyday life to test theories in clinical science.,"This viewpoint article discusses the utility of high-dosage experiments (HDEs) in everyday life to test theories in clinical science. HDEs involve experimental manipulations and assessments that occur over much longer periods of time than traditional experiments-generally days or even weeks. By nature, they also occur outside the lab, in the everyday environments of participants. Additionally, as with other experiments, the purpose of the study is concealed from participants. Experimental design is one of the most distinguishable characteristics of psychology that separates it from other behavioral sciences. Studies that rely on experiments are essential for theory testing and establishing the potential causal role of mechanisms that underlie psychopathology. Yet despite the value of experimental research, experimental studies are not currently given special prominence in clinical psychological science. For example, in the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, of all the empirical studies in the most recent year (2023), only three of 77 incorporated an experimental manipulation. Experimental research appears to be less popular in clinical psychology than in other fields, such as social psychology. What might account for this discrepancy? First, clinical samples are more difficult to recruit. This is important because experimental manipulations may produce small effects that require large samples for detection. Additionally, mechanisms hypothesized to underlie psychopathology are often chronic and intransigent. For example, cognitive factors (e.g., perfectionistic beliefs) could require an especially strong manipulation to modify in isolation. Researchers have argued that psychology has been experiencing a crisis in theory development. Eronen and Bringmann (2021) stated that one major reason for this crisis is the difficulty in establishing causal relationships between psychological constructs. The replication crisis has garnered even more attention (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). HDEs would help address these two crises and provide stronger and more replicable tests of theory. This could allow us to more precisely identify important mechanisms underlying psychopathology, potentially enhancing treatment efficacy, and enabling us to move the field forward.

To illustrate impactful analysis and science communication, we describe scientific activities targeting the needs of land trusts, NGOs, landowners, and government agencies working to conserve the Florida Wildlife Corridor (“Corridor”). This 7.2 million hectare area is prioritized for habitat connectivity conservation in the US state of Florida. Our activities are built on decades of science guiding Florida land conservation. We quantified threats (e.g., average of over 14,000 ha of development/year from 2001 to 2019) and socio‐ecological benefits of Corridor conservation, prioritized yet‐to‐be‐conserved Corridor areas, produced and shared a new statewide connectivity model, and convened groups to identify campaign science needs. The new connectivity model—the Florida Circuit Model—supported the geography of the Corridor, as designated, and facilitates local (10 km radius, or less) conservation planning. Our efforts have contributed to allocation of over $2 billion for land conservation and the permanent protection of over 82,000 ha within the Corridor by state agencies from June 2021 to March 2024.

62e2594d2af97347d2370c5a850c9bd8e5eb5b0b,Monitoring invasive macroalgae in southern Portugal: drivers and citizen science contribution,"Under certain environmental and oceanographic conditions, macroalgae can overgrow and accumulate in massive quantities on beaches, causing serious ecological and economic impacts. To address this problem, a citizen science monitoring platform was created to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of macroalgae accumulations along the beaches of Algarve in southern Portugal, with the aim to assess the extent of beach-cast events and their relationship with abiotic factors. A Redundancy Analysis (RDA) and a permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) were carried out to explore the relationship between macroalgae accumulation level and the abiotic variables: sea surface temperature, wind speed, wind direction, currents, maximum sea level, significant wave height, salinity, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, precipitation and radiation. The citizen science campaign showed great participation, resulting in 404 submissions between July 2021 and September 2023. The campaign revealed that three species of macroalgae accumulated on the beaches of Algarve, Ulva sp. (with the presence of Ectocarpales and Dyctiotales) along the sandy eastern coast, and the invasive species Asparagopsis armata and Rugulopteryx okamurae in the rocky central and western beaches, respectively. The accumulations of R. okamurae increased from 2021 to 2023, were registered throughout the year and were more abundant than those of Ulva sp. and A. armata, which were only observed in spring and summer. The highest levels of R. okamurae beach-cast depositions were related to strong wave conditions, and high sea surface temperature and salinity. The accumulation of Ulva sp. was related to high sea surface temperature and salinity whereas A. armata was also correlated with winds parallel to the shore (NW-W). PERMANOVA analysis revealed that sea surface temperature and wave conditions had a significant effect on the overall abundance of macroalgae beach-cast accumulations. Overall, our citizen science campaign effectively involved the public, leading to the collection of important data on monitoring macroalgae accumulations. Through these findings, we were able to pinpoint the environmental, atmospheric, and hydrodynamic factors that contribute to their development, movement, and buildup along the Algarve coastlines.",Frontiers in Environmental Science,2023.0,4,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1324600/pdf?isPublishedV2=False', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1324600?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1324600, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Entropy is a significant measure in information science, and several multi-criteria decision-making methods utilize the entropy weight method (EWM). In the literature, two approaches for determining the entropy weight method can be found. One involves normalization before calculating the entropy values, while the second does not. This paper investigates the normalization effect for entropy-based weights and Hellwig’s method. To compare the influence of various normalization methods in both the EWM and Hellwig’s method, a study evaluating the sustainable development of EU countries in the education area in the year 2021 was analyzed. The study used data from Eurostat related to European countries’ realization of the SDG 4 goal. It is observed that vector normalization and sum normalization did not change the entropy-based weights. In the case study, the max–min normalization influenced EWM weights. At the same time, these weights had only a very weak impact on the final rankings of countries with respect to achieving the SDG 4 goal, as determined by Hellwig’s method. The results are compared with the outcome obtained by Hellwig’s method with equal weights. The simulation study was conducted by modifying Eurostat data to investigate how the different normalization relationships discovered among the criteria affect entropy-based weights and Hellwig’s method results.",Entropy,2024.0,9,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3390/e26050365', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11120506, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ef5beed47904a59824ed4a03ce58f4bee067b309,Factors Associated with Lifestyle Behaviors among University Students—A Cross-Sectional Study,"Lifestyle behaviors are daily habits influenced by social and environmental factors. This study examined lifestyle behaviors and their associations with sociodemographics, comorbidities, and pain in Saudi university students during the academic year 2021 and 2022. All students received the study invitation via university emails to complete an online questionnaire. The questionnaire included four sections (sociodemographics, health-related information, desired health promotion activities, and a lifestyle behavior assessment) via Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP-II). The associations between study variables were assessed using Pearson’s correlation and multiple linear regression. The study questionnaire was completed by 1112 students. No correlation was found between sociodemographics and lifestyle-behavior-related factors except for students in the College of Science who appeared to have good lifestyle behaviors (an increase in HPLP II total scores of 3.69). Students with mental health issues have poorer lifestyle behaviors and spend more time sitting (p < 0.00). Students without disabilities have lower scores in health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, and stress management, while auditory disability specifically lowers health responsibility (p < 0.00). Pain was not associated with any assessed lifestyle behaviors. This study identified several significant correlations and differences between variables such as age, sedentary behavior, sleep duration, disability status, college major, and lifestyle behaviors among PNU students. These findings provide insights into the factors that influence students’ health-promoting behaviors and can help guide interventions for promoting healthier lifestyles on campus. Targeted health promotion strategies at an early age could help in decreasing overall noncommunicable disease incidents later in life. The study results should be interpreted taking into consideration that the collected data were cross-sectional and self-reported. In conclusion, the findings of this study clearly demonstrate the need for specific lifestyle and health-promoting programs that are directed toward university students.",Healthcare,2024.0,8,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/2/154/pdf?version=1704781569', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10815065, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4c5d39893d867411f4e1f247b5d00a70986fe448,A Bibliometric Analysis Based on Web of Science: Current Perspectives and Potential Trends of SMAD7 in Oncology,"Background: The number of publications on SMAD7 in the field of oncology is increasing rapidly with an upward tendency. In most cases, the mechanisms of carcinogenesis usually relate to disorders of signaling activity. Considering the crucial role of SMAD7 in the crosstalk of multiple signaling pathways, it is necessary to clarify and define the dominant research topics, core authors, and their cumulative research contributions, as well as the cooperative relationships among documents or researchers. Methods: Altogether, 3477 documents were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection with the following criteria: TS= (SMAD7 OR SMAD7-protein OR Small-Mothers-Against-Decapentaplegic-7) refined by WEB OF SCIENCE CATEGORY (ONCOLOGY) AND [excluding] PUBLICATION YEARS (2021) AND DOCUMENT TYPES (ARTICLE OR REVIEW) AND LANGUAGES (ENGLISH) AND WEB OF SCIENCE INDEX (Web of Science Core Collection, SCI), and the timespan of 2011–2020. Bibliometric visualization analysis was conducted with CiteSpace and VOSviewer. Results: The number of documents grew each year. A total of 2703 articles and 774 reviews were identified from 86 countries/regions, 3524 organizations, 928 journals, and 19,745 authors. China was the most prolific country, with 1881 documents. Contributions from China, the United States, and Germany were the most substantial. The most influential author was Lan Huiyao at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, with 24 publications and 2348 total citations. The bibliometric analysis showed that multilateral cooperation among diverse institutions or investigators was beneficial to high-quality outputs. The keyword “PPAR-gamma” exhibited the strongest burst in recent years, suggesting a potent research focus in the future. Conclusion: Research on SMAD7 in oncology is continuously developing. Bibliometrics is an interesting tool to present the characteristics of publication years, main authors, and productive organizations in a visualized way. It is worth mentioning that a prospective focus might be the specific mechanism of the interaction of PPAR-gamma with SMAD7 in oncology.

25b5d94a3878ca14a02490bf2eff5cf0935d0952,Teaching and Learning Strategies of Organic Reaction Mechanism in Pre-University Chemistry: A Scoping Review,"Teaching Organic Chemistry has always been viewed as difficult to teach, where learners are frequently repelled by the topic's high level of complexity, which appears to discriminate against the subject. Over the years, changes have been made from textbook-driven curriculum to activity-based learning for continuing meaningful learning provided in the Organic Chemistry classroom. This study aims to map the literature on teaching and learning strategies of Organic Reaction Mechanism (ORM) to be incorporated into a proposed module (ORM Module) between the year 2012 up to 2021. A computer-assisted literature search using Scopus, Google Scholar, EBSCOhost, and ProQuest was performed. Additionally, Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) five-stage framework guided the scoping review approach. The data extracted were respected to study characteristics, inclusion, and exclusion criteria of “organic reaction mechanisms” OR “mechanisms of reactions” keywords. Out of 784 records found in four databases, only 55 were suitable for full-text review, and 17 studies were finally included. Five key strategies for teaching ORM were identified: electron-pushing formalism (EPF), patterns of reactivity, technology integration, problem-solving, and self-regulated learning (SRL), along with six related teaching and learning activities. The findings of this study can be utilised for future development of the ORM Module.

Recommendations on future pandemic preparedness for public libraries are also discussed in this article. This research project conducted a bilingual (English and French) online survey targeting public library technicians, librarians, and library board members across Canada. From 1,631 research invitation emails sent to public library staff across Canada and three Facebook posts on Canadian public library staff groups, over a one-year period from November 3, 2021, to November 6, 2022. 226 individuals participated in the online survey questionnaire. Findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated social inequalities in Canada, including access to computers and the Internet. The digital divide could lead to poor health outcomes and put existing disadvantaged populations at greater risk in terms of future employment opportunities. The digital divide needs to be addressed so that Canadians in low-income households and those living with disabilities do not get left behind. Importantly, public libraries in Canada have been working tirelessly to equalize access to computers, the Internet, and digital literacy training and support.

724e2fb8fab876805fe11e8354df9425a65cc747,Parker Solar Probe: Four Years of Discoveries at Solar Cycle Minimum,"Launched on 12 Aug. 2018, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe had completed 13 of its scheduled 24 orbits around the Sun by Nov. 2022. The mission’s primary science goal is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun’s coronal magnetic field, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. Parker Solar Probe returned a treasure trove of science data that far exceeded quality, significance, and quantity expectations, leading to a significant number of discoveries reported in nearly 700 peer-reviewed publications. The first four years of the 7-year primary mission duration have been mostly during solar minimum conditions with few major solar events. Starting with orbit 8 (i.e., 28 Apr. 2021), Parker flew through the magnetically dominated corona, i.e., sub-Alfvénic solar wind, which is one of the mission’s primary objectives. In this paper, we present an overview of the scientific advances made mainly during the first four years of the Parker Solar Probe mission, which go well beyond the three science objectives that are: (1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind; and (3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles.",Space Science Reviews,2023.0,66,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11214-023-00952-4.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02727, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

93157304708bad8373cc1bc057f412185ee212a2,Bridging Research and Practice: Swiss Olympic’s Approach to Sports Science and Innovation,"Swiss Olympic is the umbrella organisation for Swiss sport and supports the national sports federations at various levels, increasingly also in the area of (sports) science. Research, development and innovation are key factors in remaining competitive in the international sports competition.
Since 2018, the funds available for applied sports science have been significantly increased. With a budget of CHF 1.5 million per year, Swiss Olympic's ‘Sports Science’ funding programme is an essential source of funding for Swiss elite sport.
The aim of the ‘Sports Science’ funding programme is to promote practice-oriented (sports) science in the federations. This is to be achieved on the one hand by subsidising scientific staff and on the other by promoting scientific measures and projects.
In addition, the Sports Innovation Hub was launched in 2024 to increase competitiveness through innovative ideas and collaborative approaches. A maximum funding application of CHF 200,000 can be triggered per project. The fundings are awarded exclusively to national member federations of Swiss Olympic through applications.
The ‘embedded scientist’, a (sports) scientist embedded in the federation structure, is proving to be a promising model for conducting the most targeted and practice-oriented research possible due to its proximity to athletes, coaches and officials.
Nevertheless, linking universities, research and business remains a challenge, one of the three key points of Stöckli's (Chef de Mission Swiss Olympic) final statements after the 2024 Summer Olympics.

The UMN Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)’s coaching program provides a variety of coaching formats (1:1, group, special programs). Methods/Study Population: CTSI provides professional coaching to faculty in the KAP, K12, KL2, and K-R01 and NLITeS programs. Typically, coaching begins with a HoganLead™ assessment and debrief. Scholars may pursue further coaching through individual sessions (up to 6 sessions during or 1-year post CTSI award) or a monthly peer coaching group facilitated by certified coaches. New URM faculty hires in the Early Career Research Awards (ECRA) program receive monthly coaching support to problem solve and attend to wellbeing. The NLITeS leadership development program for senior and mid-career faculty includes the HoganLead debriefing and 1–2 individual coaching sessions. All sessions are confidential. Results/Anticipated Results: Since 2016/2017, 80 scholars have taken the HoganLead assessment (72 debriefs), and 23 scholars have made use of 217 individual coaching sessions (most use between 6 and 12). Since 2021, 10 Scholars have participated in the Peer Coaching Group with 7 continuing over multiple years. Since 2021, 12 ECRA scholars have been supported in monthly coaching. Frequent coaching topics include self-awareness, work-life balance, overwhelm, negotiation, and leaving academic medicine. Scholar comments include: “I initially approached this professional coaching with some curiosity but fairly minimal expectations that it would change much. It has reshaped the way I approach my academic career and its associated challenges for the better, giving me confidence that I can handle the unique challenges that this career presents…” Discussion/Significance of Impact: The UMN CTSI coaching programs are extensively used and highly valued by participating faculty. Professional coaching with Hogan assessments provides faculty scholars with support that complements the mentoring they receive by going beyond a teach and learn model.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.845', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/cts.2024.845?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.845, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We explored whether newer maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids grow roots faster and deeper than older hybrids and quantified the role of management and environment on root trait expression. We measured root front velocity (RFV) and maximum root depth in 11 Bayer Crop Science legacy hybrids released from 1983 to 2017 across five environments in the US Corn Belt during 2021 and 2022. Root depth was measured weekly during vegetative stages with manual probes and the maximum root depth at crop harvest with a Giddings probe. Results indicated that the RFV and maximum root depth slightly increased with the year of hybrid release (0.13% per year, p = 0.1) at 8.7 plants m−2. Historical increases in plant density from 4.7 to 8.7 plants m−2 lowered RFV and maximum root depth, but the new hybrids compensated for this loss, resulting in 4% higher RFV and 3% higher maximum depth when comparing systems from 1983 to 2017. The environment strongly influenced root trait expression (>41%). Rain anomaly and soil bulk density explained a portion of this variation. We found a linear relationship between root depth and leaf number (R2 = 0.95) and a nonlinear relationship between RFV and maximum root depth (R2 = 0.77), which can stimulate crop model improvements. Faster and deeper roots were not correlated with maize yields in our environments. This study enhances our understanding of maize breeding impacts on root traits.",Crop science,2024.0,7,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/csc2.21208', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/csc2.21208?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/csc2.21208, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This accomplishment was a precursor to an unprecedented burgeoning of large language models (LLMs) in the life sciences. That was just the beginning. In recent months, we have moved into a hyperaccelerated phase of new foundation models, pretrained on massive datasets, with the ability to perform a wide range of tasks that are helping us understand the structure, biology, evolution, and design of proteins, RNA, DNA, and ligands, as well as their biomolecular interactions. Unlike multimodal LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude, which process text, audio, and images, these large language of life models (LLLMs) are multiomic. That is to say, they are not only multimodal but pertain to different layers of molecular biology. For example, Evo, a foundation model trained on 2.7 million diverse phage and prokaryotic genomes (equivalent to about 300 billion DNA nucleotides), predicts the impact of variants in DNA, RNA, or proteins on structure and function, as well as how essential genes are to cell function, and can generate new DNA sequences.",Science,2025.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1126/science.adv4414?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adv4414, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Anonymous self-completed questionnaires and the participants’ Child Health Booklet were used to estimate complete vaccination coverage of mandatory vaccinations against vaccine-preventable diseases of undergraduate students at the University of West Attica during the academic year 2020–2021. Student’s t-tests were used to estimate mean values. Overall, 79% (95% CI: 78–81%) of study participants were fully vaccinated. This coverage was lower in males especially for vaccines that should be done during childhood (p = 0.045). High vaccination percentage (>90%) was observed for the meningococcus group A, C, W135, Y, measles-mumps-rubella, hepatitis B and meningitis C vaccine. Nevertheless, suboptimal coverage was assessed for the booster dose of tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, for the human papillomavirus vaccine among girls, for the tuberculosis, for the meningococcus group B, for the pneumococcal, and for the seasonal influenza vaccines.

d24cf761ac347413a101f3012f9ca0a0823df2de,Undergraduate student attitudes to current poultry industry issues over four semesters: surveying an introductory poultry science course,"Abstract Individual background and demographics affect student perceptions of animal production. Understanding how science-based education alters these opinions is a critical aspect of improving university instruction as well as increasing consumer engagement in the poultry industry. The study objectives were to quantify the effects of student background, career interests, and science-based instruction on opinions regarding current issues in the poultry industry. Undergraduate students enrolled in a one semester poultry science course at Iowa State University between 2018 and 2021 were anonymously surveyed at the start and end of the semester as part of a 4-yr study. Students who opted to take the survey answered three demographic questions indicating their 1) livestock experience, 2) sex, and 3) career goals. The body of the survey consisted of 16 “poultry issue statements” where students were directed to mark a vertical dash on a 130 mm horizontal line indicating their level of agreement with each statement. Post-survey collection, the line was separated into 5 sections for discussion: responses within 0%–20% indicated strongly disagree, 21%–40% disagree, 41%–60% neutral, 61%–80% agree, and 81%–100% indicated strongly agree. Responses were analyzed using Proc Mixed in SAS Version 9.4 with a Tukey–Kramer adjustment for all pairwise comparisons using main effects including demographic categories, education (pre- or post-instruction), and year the survey was taken. Responses to various issue statements were affected by students’ livestock experience (P < 0.05; 6 out of 16 statements affected), sex (P < 0.05; 5 out of 16 statements), and ultimate career goals (P < 0.05; 4 out of 16 statements). Pre- vs. post-education responses differed significantly in 6 out of 16 statements (P < 0.05), and in 2 out of 16 poultry issue statements, the year of instruction affected student response (P < 0.05). These data indicate that individual student background, sex, and differing career interests impact opinions of current topics in the broiler and layer industries. Further, science-based education as well as the year the course was taken over consecutive semesters significantly altered student opinions.",Journal of Animal Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jas/skac381/48711783/skac381.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9838800, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This meta-analysis investigates the effect of study length on the association. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled effect sizes, dose–response analysis and funnel plots were used to synthesise the results. Data sources CINAHL (last search 19 October 2021), PsycInfo, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (21 October 2021) and SPORTDiscus (26 October 2021). Eligibility criteria Studies of adults with a prospective follow-up of at least 1 year, a valid cognitive measure or cohort in mid-life at baseline and an estimate of the association between baseline PA and follow-up all-cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia were included (n=58). Results PA was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause dementia (pooled relative risk 0.80, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.84, n=257 983), Alzheimer’s disease (0.86, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.93, n=128 261) and vascular dementia (0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95, n=33 870), even in longer follow-ups (≥20 years) for all-cause dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Neither baseline age, follow-up length nor study quality significantly moderated the associations. Dose–response meta-analyses revealed significant linear, spline and quadratic trends within estimates for all-cause dementia incidence, but only a significant spline trend for Alzheimer’s disease.

6dfe6673adb51e4dc6688cf4ac2d949e84829886,DiSSCo Flanders: A regional natural science collections management infrastructure in an international context,"DiSSCo Flanders aims at developing a standardised natural science collections management infrastructure, ensuring proper long-term conservation, and future re-usage of the collections. Meise Botanic Garden coordinates the Flemish consortium. This four-year project, funded by the FWO (Research Foundation – Flanders), started in January 2021. 
 The consortium brings together both the more classical ‘museum’ collections (Meise Botanic Garden, Ghent University Museum), with research collections (Research Institute for Nature and Forest, Flanders Research Institute for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Flanders Marine Institute, universities), and living collections (Belgian Association of Botanic Gardens and Arboreta, Zoo of Antwerp (Poo 2022)). Many of the research collections are smaller orphan collections, lacking a (full-time) curator, for which collection management is not the core business of the hosting institute. The Belgian federal DiSSCo members are associated with the project, allowing close collaboration between European, national and regional (digital) collection management inititatives.
 Building on the expertise of the European DiSSCo-related projects, an initial high-level inventory and assessment of the collections has been made and will provide a better understanding of the collections landscape in Flanders (Van Baelen 2022). This step in the digitization will increase the findability of the diverse regional collections and highlight the available knowledge to the research community. Close collaboration with the TDWG Collections Descriptions interest group and the development of the Latimer Core standard (Woodburn 2021) will ensure maximal interoperability of the collection data.
 In order to be relevant for research, the Flemish collections need to be more interconnected and linked to other data sources. To ensure that collection data is adhering to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Resuable) and ready to connect to the DiSSCo research infrastructure, DiSSCo Flanders will have a large focus on the collection(s) management system (CMS). Depending on the needs and specificities of each collection, a strategy will be chosen to implement and/or collection data will be migrated to (an) optimised system(s).
 Parallel to the digital inventory and CMS choice, the consortium addresses specific themes in the format of working groups. Most of the institutes have identified that their molecular collection (DNA, tissues) has not been properly acknowledged as a separate long-term collection. Challenges such as the storage and curation of e-DNA and environmental samples (e.g., soil) have been identified.
 Very often it will only be feasible to add basic data in the CMS and essential data is not available to the researchers. DiSSCo Flanders invests in the enrichment of specimen data to ensure that a maximal amount of information becomes available to the community. This can be accomplished either through the use of citizen science/crowdsourcing using the DoeDat platform (Groom 2018), or by using machine learning techniques performed by the IDLab at Ghent University (Thirukokaranam Chandrasekar 2021). 
 Besides the technical aspects of the DiSSCo research infrastructure, the consortium is covering topics such as data publication, legal aspects of collections, standard operating procedures, etc. through knowledge sharing and active dialog.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2022.0,2,"{'url': 'https://biss.pensoft.net/article/94350/download/pdf/', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.6.94350?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.6.94350, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The 4th ABAW Competition is a continuation of the Competitions held at IEEE CVPR 2022, ICCV 2021, IEEE FG 2020 and IEEE CVPR 2017 Conferences, and aims at automatically analyzing affect. In the previous runs of this Competition, the Challenges targeted Valence-Arousal Estimation, Expression Classification and Action Unit Detection. This year the Competition encompasses two different Challenges: i) a Multi-Task-Learning one in which the goal is to learn at the same time (i.e., in a multi-task learning setting) all the three above mentioned tasks; and ii) a Learning from Synthetic Data one in which the goal is to learn to recognise the basic expressions from artificially generated data and generalise to real data. The Aff-Wild2 database is a large scale in-the-wild database and the first one that contains annotations for valence and arousal, expressions and action units. This database is the basis for the above Challenges. In more detail: i) s-Aff-Wild2 -- a static version of Aff-Wild2 database -- has been constructed and utilized for the purposes of the Multi-Task-Learning Challenge; and ii) some specific frames-images from the Aff-Wild2 database have been used in an expression manipulation manner for creating the synthetic dataset, which is the basis for the Learning from Synthetic Data Challenge. In this paper, at first we present the two Challenges, along with the utilized corpora, then we outline the evaluation metrics and finally present the baseline systems per Challenge, as well as their derived results.

It also aimed to find out if the teachers’ role in developing school students’ creative thinking skills differed as per their work place (Jordan and Oman) and whether or not there were statistically significant differences at the significance level (0.05=α) in the teachers’ role in developing school students’ creative thinking skills from the perspective of teachers attributed to the variable of teaching experience. To achieve the study objectives, the descriptive survey approach was used through developing a questionnaire with 31 statements which was distributed to a sample of 140 teachers teaching science to grades 4 to 8 in public schools in Jordan and Sultanate of Oman in the academic year 2021 – 2022. 5- point Likert scale was used to analyze the data collected. The findings showed that primary education science teachers practiced creative thinking skills with their students to a high degree as the mean of their responses to the questionnaire statements was 3.43 with a standard deviation 1.12. There were no statistically significant differences in the science teachers’ response means in Jordan and Oman. However, there were statistically significant differences at the significance level (0.05=α) in the teachers’ response means in favor of the female teachers whose response mean was 4.25 which was higher than the male teachers’ response mean which was 3.35. This result might be attributed to a number of factors such as women in Arab societies try to prove themselves and try to prove that they are more distinguished than men.

However, to assess the quality of a teacher training program it is necessary to track some of the non-cognitive parameters. Metacognition is one of these parameters. The present study aimed at the longitudinal trajectory of the development of metacognition in pre-service teachers as an indicator of the quality of the applied teacher training program. The study included 160 pre-service elementary school teachers studying at Teacher Education Faculty at University of Belgrade. The participants’ metacognitive development was measured by Metacognitive Awareness Inventory at three points of time (the beginning of studying, the academic year 2021/22 – T1, the end of the first year – T2, and the end of the second year, 2022/23-T3). The elementary school teacher training program is based on a combination of science and pedagogy related courses that together with school teaching practice start from the first semester. The courses based on problem solving and inquiry-based approach encourage students’ search for adequate strategies and the assessment of their effectiveness. The findings point to a significant increase in total metacognition score between T1 and T2 and somewhat less intense increase between T2 and T3. The findings also point to a significant increase in all metacognitive subcomponents, with Conditional knowledge and Debugging strategies showing a significant increase only between T2 and T3. Between T1 and T2 the largest differences were detected in Declarative knowledge, Comprehension monitoring, and Planning.

The objective of this case study was to determine the impact of course format, as well as the effects of student sex, time of year at which the course was taken, and the institution it was taken at on student performance in an undergraduate animal science course. The course used for this study was taught at two institutions (University of Florida; UF and University of Nevada, Reno; UNR) over 7 yr (2014–2017 at UNR and 2018–2021 at UF). Student’s performance (n = 911) was evaluated using both quizzes and exams from 2014 through the spring semester 2020 and only exams were used for summer and fall semesters of 2020 and the spring and summer semesters of 2021. The final score (out of 100%) for each student was used to evaluate student’s performance. In addition, students were classified as high-performing students, if they scored ≥95% and low-performing students, if they scored ≤70%. The variables evaluated were the effects of semester (spring, summer, or fall), institution (UF or UNR), sex (male or female), number of teaching assistants (TAs; 0–13), and course format (online or in-person). The course was taught in-person at UNR and in-person and online at UF. The spring semester of 2020 was taught in-person until March but was switched to online approximately 9 wk after the semester started and was considered an online semester for this analysis. As the course was only taught online at UF, the variable course format was assessed using UF records only. Data were analyzed using both linear models and logistic regressions. The probability that students were high performing was not affected by sex or institution. Interestingly, both fall semester and the online format had a positive, desirable effect on the probability that students were high performing. The probability that students were low performing was not affected by sex. However, if a student performed poorly in the class, they were more likely to have taken the course at UNR, or at UF with many TAs. Thus, student’s performance was impacted by changing the course format, as well as institution, the number of TAs, and the semester in which the course was taken.",Translational Animal Science,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/tas/article-pdf/6/1/txac004/42567346/txac004.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8860001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It belongs to the family Solanaceae. Approximately 20-27 species of chilli are found, out of which five are domesticated viz., C. annuum, C. baccatum, C. chinense, C. frutescens, and C. pubescens in different parts of the world. Chilli crop suffers from various diseases in which anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum capsici is a very serious one, causes huge yield losses in India. Severely infected fruits look straw colour and bear numerous acervuli in concentric rings. Around 27℃ temperature, 80% relative humidity and soil pH 5-6 promote infection and disease progress.

0194ba98e01a0ca19fb556af7c7e28f967ff64bc,A Criminological Study of the Impact of Heroin Use on Problems Associated with Urban Poverty in Sri Lanka,"Drug abuse has caused a lot of personal and social problems globally. In almost every country in the world, offences related to drugs are considered illegal behaviours, and related punishments have been established. However, laws and regulations related to intoxicants vary from country to country. Misbehaviour related to the use of drugs in Sri Lanka has also been defined as illegal behaviour. This study is very important from a criminological and social science point of view on how heroin use affects urban poverty. Colombo City is unique among the urban areas of Sri Lanka, and it is evident that a large number of low-income urban communities around the city are living without very minimal facilities. One of the main factors affecting their poverty is the use of heroin by the people living in those families. Among those arrested for drug-related offences in the year 2021, most were arrested for heroin-related offences. In the five years since that year, the number of arrests for heroin offences has increased every year more than for other drugs. The methods of interview, questionnaire, and observation were used to collect the primary data for the research. Accordingly, fifty people prone to heroin use who live in shacks and apartment complexes in the district’s low-income community were used as the sample. Data analysis was conducted quantitatively and qualitatively. In terms of ethnicity, Sinhalese nationals are the most arrested for heroin-related offences. The percentage is 50% arrests among Sinhalese, 30% among Muslims, and 20% among Tamils. Age-wise, the age groups with the highest number of arrests are 16–20 and 31–35. The great majority work as labourers or in hired jobs, and the majority have low levels of education. Families face many problems as a result of heroin usage and related offences. Economic problems, family disputes, leaving families, the tendency to commit other crimes, health problems, legal problems, problems in the socialisation of children, and many other personal and social problems have arisen due to this. These problems are directly linked to urban sprawl.",International journal of research and innovation in social science,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47772/ijriss.2024.807163?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2024.807163, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

79bd9f476f095a69fb98923b7a310aa337e2e4a1,Antidiarrheal effect of Psidium guajava L. extract in acute diarrhea: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND
Acute diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of childhood mortality and morbidity worldwide. Psidium guajava has been globally used for its antidiarrheal potential. Carry out a systematic review of scientific articles published up to the year 2021, which included in vivo pre-clinical tests and clinical trials involving patients with acute infectious diarrhea to verify the antidiarrheal, antibacterial, and antispasmodic effects of galenic preparations or phytopharmaceuticals from P. guajava. PRISMA and Rayyan were used as tools for the selection of studies collected in four databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct). The keywords used to carry out the search were: ""Psidium guajava"", ""guava"", ""antidiarrhea*"", ""diarrhe*"", joined by Boolean operators ""OR"" or ""AND"". The characteristics of studies in animal models of acute diarrhea induction, as well as in vivo and in vitro motility and microbiological tests linked with its main pathophysiological mechanisms, were collected.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Twenty-three articles were included. Twenty (87%) of theirs reported heterogenic preclinical studies, predominating pharmacological studies of efficacy against conventional antidiarrheal agents, which utilized relevant outcomes and models of infectious diarrhea from the top pathogens in the clinic along with classical castor oil-induced diarrhea associated with motility tests. Only three of them (13%) corresponded to clinical trials to study the efficacy, dose, and safety of these preparations. Most studies reported positive results and significant mechanistic evidence from antibacterial, anti-motility, anti-secretory, and protective/anti-inflammatory perspectives. However, further studies are needed to define the clinical significance and safety treatment with P. guajava extracts. This article is protected by copyright.

I then briefly discuss her comprehensive and coherent presentation of the CSR, noting, however, several issues with which I have problems (fractionation, an ahistorical “presentist” bias, and whether or not an “agnostic” view of religious teachings should remain the norm in the modern university curricula). Nevertheless, White’s Introduction is a most welcome and long-overdue contribution to the academic study of religion, the 150-year trajectory of which has been characterized by an anti-scientific history.",Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1558/jcsr.20459?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1558/jcsr.20459, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

28fcad008483c60b8ae08f9530e6923488eccd42,Enhancing Taxonomic Skills in West Africa and Supporting the Growth of GC Herbarium (Ghana),"Training the next generation of environmental scientists is critical to the future of life on Earth as acknowledged in 2021 by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG, Kew) in Our Manifesto for Change. RBG, Kew is also committed to strengthening capacity in the most biodiverse tropical countries by sharing expertise and collections, to enhance the global conservation effort. Developing training programmes to enhance taxonomic capacity in Africa and meeting the demand for early career in-country taxonomists was identified as the first step to accelerate the documentation and conservation of African plant diversity.
 Two years ago, RBG, Kew, in collaboration with the University of Ghana and the Ghana Herbarium (GC) and with support from the Schroder Charity Trust and Mallinckrodt Foundation, developed a tailored “Plant Taxonomy Skills for Ecology and Conservation” training course. This was planned to run in Africa, South America and Asia, alternating each year. The pilot was organised in Ghana, Africa in 2022. Participants for this 5-week course were selected from over 260 applicants. Delivered in a hybrid format, the course started with 3 weeks of online lectures, pre-recorded by 15 plant scientists and curators at RBG, Kew, as well as online interactive sessions. This was then followed by 2 weeks of in-person training in Ghana, including a 1-day field trip for practical collecting tips. The training covered herbarium curation techniques as well as concepts and skills needed for taxonomic revisions such as nomenclature, taxonomy, analysis of herbarium specimens, databasing, geo-referencing, preparation of morphological descriptions, diagnosis and identification keys as well as building distribution maps and red listing. The in-country teaching team included a curator-botanist, a plant taxonomist, a science education coordinator from RBG, Kew and two professors from University of Ghana. The course ended with a written assignment in the form of a taxonomic revision. A short survey was sent out to all course participants two years after the course to gather impacts of the training on their careers and uncover the most positive and negative aspects of the course.
 The course provided many positive outcomes: 15 plant taxonomists from eight African countries were trained, and jointly produced a taxonomic revision of 28 species of Ipomoea L. (Convolvulaceae) from Ghana (Williams et al. 2024). Additionally, The African Taxonomists Network was initiated by the course participants with a mission of ‘Fostering the next generation of taxonomists to bridge the generational gap and revitalize the relevance of taxonomy in Africa for the future.’ This network now has over 60 members, meets regularly online, and has a large presence on social media. Furthermore, the course also resulted in the awarding of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) Biodiversity Challenge grant to the GC Herbarium in 2022. This grant enabled acquiring essential plant collecting equipment and herbarium materials, either by sourcing them in Ghana or from abroad. The GC herbarium, founded in 1952, contains ~85,000 collections of plant and algae specimens from Ghana and across West Africa with high historical, teaching and research value. This collection is vital to enhancing in-country taxonomic capacity. Therefore, the improvement and upgrade supported by the grant, as well as its recognition, are essential. Another rewarding impact of the course is strengthening of links between RBG, Kew and African institutions of higher education. These links have quickly developed into a larger partnership and were the first step towards a long-term collaboration. The ultimate objective of this collaboration has been to create the necessary conditions, both in infrastructure and human capacity to deliver the Flora of Ghana. This will be achieved by implementing a project to support the maintenance and growth of the GC herbarium in addition to taxonomic capacity building and teaching.
 The participants benefited from the course by engaging with mentors, networking and exchanging ideas, forming links with individuals with similar research interests and obtaining additional training and career progression opportunities. In the feedback survey, all participants reported that this course made them consider a career or future studies in plant taxonomy and 80% of the participants reported securing a new job or a student position in plant taxonomy two years after the course. In addition, all participants listed several positive impacts of the course on their career such as confidence in producing a taxonomic revision, gaining herbarium management skills and opportunities for new collaborations. This course has been subsequently successfully run in South America (Bolivia) and Asia (Indonesia), with expectations of similarly positive outcomes, and is already planned to return to Africa (Kenya) in 2025.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139237', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.139237?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.139237, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A significant public health issue is the morbidity that skin diseases cause in children. There is a dearth of research on this pediatric issue in our nation, which is either centered on a condition, a community, or a particular population group. Objective To evaluate the dermatological complaints of the pediatric patients attending a dermatology outpatient department in a tertiary care hospital. Materials And Methods We retrospectively analyzed a total of 2472 pediatric patients who were in age range 0-18 years and came to the OPD of dermatology & venereology department of Ibn Sina Medical College Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, over a period of 1½ year from January, 2020 to June, 2021. Data were collected on special proforma and analyzed with appropriate method. Results Among 2472 patients 1157 (46.8%) were male and 1315 (53.2%) were female and most of the patients belonged to the age group 12-18 year (52.6%). Male female ratio was 0.88:1. All diseases were broadly classified into noninfectious (71.2%) and infectious dermatoses (28.8%). Dermatitis (38.9%), infections (28.8%) and acne (14.44%) came out to be the top most common cause for OPD attendances. For the specific skin diseases, 20.1% were atopic dermatitis, 14.44% were acne, and 11.8 % were fungal infections. Atopic dermatitis was the most common condition below 12 years of age. In 12-18 years of age group, the most common condition was acne; females were more affected than males. Among the viral infections, wart was the most common (22.1%). Conclusion Atopic dermatitis was found to be the most common noninfectious disease and fungal infection was the most common infectious disease in all age groups and genders.

03e82bfb1474272082b39a528307946de65e4b6a,Impact of a self-defense and self-assertion course on self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women,"Introduction & Purpose
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines violence as “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation” (World Health Organization, 2002, p. 5). There are different types of violence: physical, somatic or bodily violence, psychological, psychic or emotional violence, sexual violence, and violence involving deprivation or neglect (World Health Organization, 2002).
The number of violent crimes across Austria rose by 16.9% in 2022 compared to the previous year, to 78,836 reports (Bundesministerium für Inneres, 2023). According to Statista (2024), Austria ranked sixth out of a total of 27 European countries in terms of the relative number of people affected by rape in 2021, with women affected 9.2 times more frequently than men (37.8 vs. 4.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively). Austria ranked the same across Europe (out of 28 countries) with regard to the rate of female victims of intentional homicide, with a total of 0.98 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants (Europäisches Institut für Gleichstellungsfragen, 2022).
Robust psychological differences between women and men, so-called gender gaps, have been shown in literature. One gender gap, which has been systematically researched since the 1990s and which can still be found across cultures, is the lower self-esteem and self-confidence of girls and women compared to boys and men (Casale, 2020). This gender gap can in turn lead to inequalities in social status and salary (Righetti et al., 2020).
Psychological characteristics again appear to play an important role in violence. Indeed, Fazzone et al. (2000) identified personal protective factors, which include characteristics such as self-confidence, self-reliance, self-motivation, flexibility, and self-assurance, against community and interpersonal violence in home health care.
Scientific studies have shown the effectiveness of self-defense courses on psychological characteristics such as self-confidence and assertiveness of participants (Brecklin, 2008; Gidycz & Dardis, 2014). In particular, most of the self-defense training programs that were analyzed showed positive changes in the measured psychological characteristics, although these results were not always consistent (Brecklin, 2008). In addition, supposed important characteristics such as self-confidence and self-assurance were not measured in the majority of cases (Brecklin, 2008). It is also worth mentioning that these older studies are mostly unpublished dissertations and, in accordance with Brecklin (2008), measures used should be revised to better fit the specific situational goals of self-defense training. This means that rather than just measuring assertiveness in everyday situations, it would be interesting to measure the likelihood of participants using assertiveness techniques in potential assault situations (Brecklin, 2008).
The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate possible effects of a self-defense and self-assertion course (SSC) on self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women when being put into potential assault situations.
Methods
A quasi-experimental study was conducted with voluntary adult female participants in a two-day SSC lasting a total of 10 hours, along with adult female controls who also took part in the study. Inclusion criteria were female gender, age ≥ 18 years, fluency in German (reading and writing), and written informed consent. Participants who had taken part in a SSC or had been practicing martial arts/ combat sports within the 3 months before or during the surveyed period were excluded from the study. The participants were asked about the effects of the SSC as well as the control period using a standardized online questionnaire that complies with the ethical standards of the Department of Sports Science at the University of Innsbruck (certificate of good standing, 25/2006). The survey was conducted at two different times: directly before the start and directly after the end of the SSC (or before and after the simultaneous control period). The questionnaire in German language, which was developed based on relevant literature (Brecklin, 2008; Kidder et al., 1983), included both quantitative and qualitative variables such as open questions. Among other things, the participants were asked to imagine themselves in situations in which they were exposed to different forms as well as intensities of violence and to indicate their level of self-confidence and self-assurance in these situations. A visual analogue scale ranging continuously from 0 (does not apply at all) to 100 (applies completely) was used for this purpose. The SSC took place in the city of Innsbruck (Austria) at various educational institutions between May 2019 and February 2020. The program of the SSC was standardized and included physical defense techniques such as punching, pushing, and kicking techniques (~15%), protective postures, and liberation techniques (~50%), as well as theoretical inputs, exercises for setting boundaries, case studies, and role plays (~35%). Participants of the control group were free in choosing their activities during the control period, however, the participation neither in a SSC nor in martial arts/ combat sports was allowed.
Data are presented as means ± standard deviations. After checking for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test) and for homogeneity (Levene-Test), t-tests for independent samples were applied to check for differences between means of the change score of the assessed parameters of the two samples. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 29 women took part in the study: 18 in the intervention group (IG, 40.0 ± 12.4 years) and 11 in the control group (CG, 30.5 ± 9.9 years). The age difference between the groups was not significant. The results indicate that women in the IG showed significant changes in several parameters compared to those in the CG, particularly when being put into situations in which they were exposed to different forms and intensities of violence. Accordingly, higher self-confidence and self-assurance were evident in the case of severe physical violence as well as in the case of mild psychological violence and higher self-assurance was shown in the case of severe psychological violence (Figure 1). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to mild physical violence or mild and severe sexual violence. Furthermore, the assessment of the open questions with regard to the organization of the SSC and the program offered suggests that the courses were very well received by the participants.
Discussion
The study shows that a relatively short SSC leads to a higher increase of both self-confidence and self-assurance of adult women, both in situations of physical and psychological violence, compared to the control group. No significant differences between the groups were found with regard to situations of sexual violence, which is presumably due to the framework conditions of the courses (with only female participants). Therefore, future studies evaluating the impact of SSC on self-confidence and self-assurance of women exposed to sexual violence should include practice with male training partners. Additionally, in the interest of sustainability, it is important to achieve long-term changes in attitudes and behavior, which should be the goal of future research.
The study’s limitations that should be considered include the lack of an a priori power analysis, the absence of random group allocation, the missing standardization and supervision of the activity of the control group, the use of non-validated single-item scales, possible bias due to the overestimation of effects because of the temporal proximity of the survey to the SSC, and the failure to account for confounding variables such as age, which however did not differ significantly between groups.
Conclusion
Since violence is often perpetrated against women, particularly in Austria, and since women show less self-confidence and self-assurance than men, the promotion of high-quality SSC lasting at least 10 hours can be recommended to women in order to strengthen these resources.

Method: The authors formed a Diversity in Academia Workgroup where we created the infrastructure and process to increase the number of Diversity Supplements. Each year, the Office of Sponsored Programs provided a list of grants that would be eligible to submit a Diversity Supplement. We surveyed the Principal Investigators inquiring about their interest in working with a trainee on a Diversity Supplement. If yes, we included their information in a database we built so that trainees could search for eligible research studies. The Diversity Deans then identified underrepresented faculty and postdoctoral researchers. We invited Program Officers from NIH to participate in a panel presentation for trainees, which was well attended. Results: The number of Diversity Supplements awarded to Pitt researchers has significantly increased from 7 in 2020 to 10 in 2021 and to 15 in 2022. Six more have been awarded in the first half of 2023. Conclusions: We created the Diversity in Academia Workgroup with the goal to increase the number of Diversity Supplements at the University of Pittsburgh and in so doing, increase the diversity in the biomedical research workforce.

Traditional diabetes management, typically involving regular insulin injections and constant monitoring, imposes a significant burden on patients. However, this new therapy promises to revolutionize diabetes care. A team of researchers from Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, the Centre for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Renji Hospital successfully cured a 59-year-old patient with type-2 diabetes using cell therapy. The patient, whose blood sugar levels remained uncontrolled despite regular insulin injections, underwent a cell transplant in July 2021. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patient were reprogrammed into ""seed cells"" that act like pancreatic islet cells and then implanted. Within eleven weeks, the patient no longer required insulin injections, and after a year, he stopped all diabetes-related medications. Follow-up examinations confirmed the restoration of pancreatic islet function, and the patient has been insulin-free for 33 months, highlighting the long-term efficacy of the treatment. This therapy harnesses the body's regenerative capabilities, marking a significant milestone in regenerative medicine. The innovative approach not only cures the patient but also offers the potential for preventing diabetes.

dfe9d60923fe41a10fd5339ea00c671c432d2ba9,534 Forming a Translational Operations Group: Bridging the Gap to Enhance CTSA Hub Operational Efficiencies,"OBJECTIVES/GOALS: CTSA Hubs represent complex centers where teams work to meet multiple goals of the CTSA grant. An existing challenge is to work collaboratively across teams. To address this challenge, a Translational Operations Group (TOG) was established. Results show enhanced intra-hub collaboration and communication while reducing inefficiencies. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The TOG is composed of all CTSA hub module program managers who are charged with operationalizing vision into reality. The TOG was formed in 2021 as a mechanism to integrate new team members, provide connection, and improve cross-core awareness and collaboration. Leveraging team science principles, a team charter was developed outlining specific TOG aims and objectives. Collectively, shared goals were identified with establishment of group norms, effective communication pathways, shared resources and knowledge and meeting cadence. Leadership of the group rotates among the TOG members annually further engaging all TOG members. Pre and Post (one year) surveys were developed and provided to TOG members to gauge TOG effectiveness and perceptions of TOG members. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Survey results demonstrate the effectiveness of the TOG concept in promoting core/module awareness and goals, intra-core/module interconnectedness, and forming connections and integration into the CTSA hub ecosystem. Psycho-social questions demonstrated an increase in organizational self-esteem within the pre to post survey period in relation to the specific TOG member’s core/module and the CTSA hub as a whole. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Formation of a TOG has been successful within a virtual environment where connection is challenging. Integration of members to the operational activities is critical to foster a positive work environment, reduce silo effects, and provide a space for sharing resources and knowledge.

Regular physical activity (PA) has benefits for health throughout the lifespan. PA benefits musculoskeletal, cardio metabolic health, and overall well-being (Kapoor et al., 2022). However, data from 2017 shows that about 55-83% of women and 47-74% of men from European countries (EU) do not meet these guidelines (Lübs et al,. 2018). Moreover, adults at the age of 40-54 (aOR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52-0.81) and 55-64 (aOR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49-0.77) are less likely to have moderate or high levels of PA in comparison with those 18-24 years of age. (Nikitara et al., 2021). Sedentary behavior (SB) including activities such as watching television, playing computer games, browsing the internet has increased (Wang et al., 2019). Canada has an established track record in the development of 24-hour movement guidelines on PA, SB, and sleep. They have previously release guidelines for all age groups. Following Canada’s lead, several jurisdictions including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa have incorporated the 24-hour movement concepts (Tremblay, 2020).  There is a lack of data for 24-hour behavior guideline in the European context. There are no specific recommendations on SB and sleep. Therefore, this project will present the background, methods and design of a 24-hour movement summary of behaviors (PA, SB and sleep) in Europe. 
Methods 
We will utilize existing PA, SB and sleep data from the World Health Organization on European adults 18+. Analysis using mean, median, and 95% confidence Intervals, will be complemented by frequency distributions and histograms. These will be stratified by age and sex subgroups for a more comprehensive overview. 
Results 
The findings from this research have the potential to  inform surveillance efforts, shape policies and public health strategies, improve overall well-being, and contribute to the development of evidence-based guidelines. 
Discussion/Conclusion 
Implications of this research may inform researchers on further questions to pursue, policy makers in resource allocation, and practitioners on where to focus intervention efforts.

Good strategic procurement practice has been attributed to positive results of procurement performance. Strategic procurement is important mainly because it enables an organization to clearly define the purpose of the procurement department in the organization. Procurement in the county governments in Kenya is guided by the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act of 2015 and its revised edition of 2016. However, in the financial year 2021/2022, Report of the Auditor-General highlighted a myriad of procurement challenges in major county governments in Kenya. City counties in Kenya faces a myriad of procurement challenges such as lack of inventory records, and payments processed without any reference to local service orders (LSOs), bills of quantities documents, project files, contractor’s invoices, completion certificates from technical departments and inspection and acceptance committee reports. The objective of the study was to establish the influence of strategic procurement practices on procurement performance of City Counties in Kenya. The study was guided by Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, Stewardship Theory, Institutional Theory and Technology Acceptance Theory (TAM). This study adopted correlational research design. The study targeted 56 procurement officers from Nairobi City County, Mombasa City County, Kisumu City County and Nakuru City County. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data. The collected data was coded and entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and version 27 and Python software for quantitative analysis. The data collected was subjected to various diagnostic tests to ensure adherence to the assumptions of regression analysis, thus providing an accurate and reliable prediction of the relationship among the variables. The study elucidated that strategic procurement practices, specifically strategic sourcing, e-procurement, and contract and supplier management, notably enhance procurement performance in city counties. Strategic sourcing was shown to lower costs and improve supplier relations. E-procurement streamlined processes and enhanced transparency, though challenges like resistance to change were noted. Effective contract and supplier management was crucial, directly influencing performance by ensuring supplier compliance and fostering robust relationships. Recommendations include adopting comprehensive sourcing strategies, integrating e-procurement, and maintaining stringent supplier management to improve procurement outcomes. These results and recommendations would be of great benefit to the management and employees in the counties by providing them with insights into procurement practices. The study provides useful, relevant and up to date information on the best procurement practices, limitations and challenges to industry professionals, institutions and suppliers in the procurement practices. The future researchers will also benefit in that they will be able to increase their understanding of the pertinent issues concerning strategic procurement practices.",Social Science Research Network,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/ssrn.5153116?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5153116, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Patients in the tacrolimus cohort were treated with 0.03 percent tacrolimus ointment two times daily for 60 days, followed by a single application daily for 60 days, and once on alternate days for the next two months. The control group got topical fluorometholone 0.1% drops in their eyes for two weeks, after which the amount given was gradually lowered for another two weeks. During the subsequent follow-up time frame, both groups received topical olopatadine 0.1% drops for the eyes twice daily. Modifications to symptoms and signs were documented among the groups to measure the success of therapy, and their severity was rated using a four-point scale.Results: During the follow-up period, 60 children with bilateral VKC were observed, and the mean age of both groups was similar. Papillary hypertrophy and conjunctival hyperemia were the most common signs, while itching was the most frequently reported symptom. After treatment, Symptoms and signs decreased significantly in both of the groups. However, at three and six months, the group treated with 0.03 percent tacrolimus ointment showed a more notable improvement in symptom and sign scores. The tacrolimus group tolerated the treatment well, with only a few complaining of a stinging sensation. The control group experienced one incidence of elevated intraocular pressure.Conclusion: 0.03% tacrolimus ointment is an effective and secure therapy for vernal keratoconjunctivitis in young individuals. This different treatment technique may help and lower the likelihood of steroid-related problems in patients with chronic VKC.

Thirty Canadian oat (Avena sativa L.) genotypes, grown in three Canadian growing locations (Brandon, Manitoba; Portage la Prairie, Manitoba; and Lacombe, Alberta) over 2 consecutive years (2020–2021), were analyzed. RESULTS Analysis of variance showed that the protein, total starch, and amylose content were significantly affected by genotype, environment, and their interaction. A principal component analysis bi‐plot illustrated that protein and total starch had an inverse relationship and were more affected by growing year, whereas amylose content had a negligible influence. The majority of genotypes were stable across environments but some genotypes, like CDC Morrison, were more influenced by different environments. Correlation analysis suggested that drought‐like conditions early in the growing season generated oat genotypes that favored the accumulation of protein, β‐glucan, and oil. CONCLUSION The results provide detailed information regarding the relationship between important oat chemical and physical traits and different growing environments, which can assist breeders to improve characteristics to obtain high‐quality oat grains and thus high‐quality end products. © 2025 His Majesty the King in Right of Canada and The Author(s).

To address this challenge, this study aims to strengthen evidence-based practice (EBP) in Malaysia through the integration of the TIME model (Transform, Innovate, Model, Enhancement) for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) public awareness for vital selfcare monitoring, particularly focusing on pulse monitoring and perfusion index (PI) as essential components of patient care. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, this research is grounded in the American Nurses Association’s (ANA, 2024) EBP model. The primary objectives of the study are: (1) to assess the factors influencing the implementation of various CPR practices and public health monitoring awareness, (2) to analyse the relationship between CPR approaches and public health monitoring awareness through statistical regression analysis, and (3) to develop an EBP practice guide for strategic CPR awareness. A comprehensive literature review utilizing databases such as OUM e-library, Science Direct, AHA, and ResearchGate provided insights from over 150 relevant sources. A mixed-methods design was applied, including quantitative data from surveys and qualitative data from open-ended questionnaires, with a sample of 200 final-year nursing students. Findings will inform the development of a recommended EBP model enhancement and strategic CPR guidelines, culminating in an eBook for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) public awareness for vital selfcare monitoring 2025-2030. The TIME model’s application in this context serves as a transformative and innovative framework that fosters best practices in CPR training and enhances public health awareness, on collaboration, patient-centred care, and the sustainability of health outcomes in Malaysia. focusing of Pulse Self-Monitoring for Public Awareness and CPR Readiness in Malaysia.",International journal of research and innovation in social science,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47772/ijriss.2025.9020194?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2025.9020194, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

 This study investigates the impact of prerequisite science courses on student outcomes in a physician assistant (PA) training program. Given the conflicting literature on the necessity of such coursework and the variation in required courses across PA programs, this study aimed to assess whether prerequisite courses are essential for success. One PA program eliminated prerequisite coursework, allowing analysis of impacts on student outcomes. Data from 2018–2021 Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) records and student performance metrics were analyzed. Stratification analysis and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between the number of science credit hours and clinical year variables. Results indicate no consistent correlation between completed prerequisite credit hours and student performance on various assessments. Even applicants with minimal (0–1) credit hours performed similarly to those with extensive (> 15) credit hours. There was no statistically significant correlation between prerequisite courses and Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam (PANCE) scores. Additionally, the study found no significant relationship between the nationally benchmarked Physician Assistant Clinical Knowledge Rating and Assessment Tool (patterned off the PANCE) scores and the number of physiology credit hours, but a notable inverse relationship between genetics credit hours and a nationally benchmarked summative examination (End of Curriculum Exam (ECOE)) performance. The analysis revealed that variations in prerequisite coursework did not consistently correlate with student performance across assessments, casting doubt on the necessity of specific science courses for PA program success.

1a1835d1ee545518f868b5e02c2a7b24cf3b6066,Maize breeding enhances lodging resistance through vertical allocation changes of stem dry matter and nitrogen,"The maize stem provides structural support to other plant organs and stores carbohydrates and nitrogen (N) that can be remobilized to grain. Yet it remains unknown whether breeding programs have indirectly affected vertical stem dry matter and N allocation. Our objectives were to i) determine the dry matter and N allocations across different stem portions in maize hybrids released from 1980 to 2020 at the start (R2) and end of grain-filling period (R6), and ii) investigate the dry matter and N remobilization patterns by stem portion. We studied 23 Bayer Crop Science hybrids (release year 1980 to 2020) of different relative maturities (short and long maturity) in 2021 and 2022. Stem dry weight, N concentration, and N content by stem portion (four equal-length sections) were measured at R2 and R6 stages. We found that the average vertical distribution of the stem dry matter and N content along the plant height was 8% (top), 17% (middle-top), 29% (middle-bottom), and 46% (bottom). Maize breeding slightly reduced the total stem dry matter and N content at R2 stage in both relative maturities, and this reduction occurred in the top two quarters, with no significant change in the bottom stem portion. At R6 stage, the N content was significantly reduced in long maturity hybrids, and all the stem portions contributed to this reduction. Newer hybrids of both relative maturities remobilized less dry matter than the older hybrids (17 vs 20%) but slightly more N (39 vs 36%). We concluded that maize breeding efforts have indirectly affected vertical stem dry matter allocation towards less stem dry matter above the ear leaf. This change reduces plants’ center of gravity, which could explain why new hybrids are more resistant to lodging and can accommodate high plant densities.

9447be6ea37d182d4cfd00ee7090e9cd95b1457d,225 Evaluation of the characteristics and impact of the NCATS CTSA Program pilot translational and clinical studies,"Objectives/Goals: To fully understand the scientific objectives, overall financial commitment, and outcome of the pilot projects. Methods/Study Population: We evaluated pilots reported in the in the annual, interim, and final Research Performance Progress Reports (RPPRs) for Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program UM1 and UL1 grants from FYs 2021–2023 to assess research categories across the translational science spectrum. We analyzed the number of pilots involving human subjects, vertebrate animals, both, or neither; financial allocations; publication outputs; and other characteristics. Pilots reported across multiple years were deduplicated and assigned to the latest reporting year. Each pilot was classified into broad (Category 1) and specific (Category 2) areas. Descriptive statistics, including means and frequency distributions, were generated. Multi-year pilots with NA or 0 values used the most recent prior value. Results/Anticipated Results: In the period from FY 2021 to 2023, 61 hubs reported 1,811 unique pilot projects in their RPPRs, receiving a total of approximately $62 million, of which two-thirds were expended. On average, each hub conducted 30 pilots with an award size of about $35K. Just over half of the pilots involved human subjects research (HSR), while about one-third were neither HSR nor vertebrate animal studies (VAS), with the remaining focused primarily on VAS. Notably, only 13% of pilots resulted in peer-reviewed publications. Collaborative efforts were observed in one-third of the projects. The majority of pilots fell into Preclinical Research (46%), followed by Clinical Research (33%) and Public Health (20%). Limitations in data quality were identified, and ten pilots reported $0 awarded funds, which may be captured in future RPPRs. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Analysis of pilots reported in RPPRs from FYs 2021–2023 across 61 hubs shows a strong focus on HSR, highlighting collaborative efforts that enhance translational science and align with CTSA goals. Future analysis will help assess the pilots’ impact and their alignment with NCATS’ mission to expedite research translation into health solutions.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.875', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/cts.2024.875?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2024.875, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The aim of this study was to provide a detailed understanding of redeployment and training during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic by capturing and considering the merit of the strategies enlisted and the experiences and needs of redeployed healthcare workers (HCWs). Design The review involved a systematic search of key terms related to intensive care AND training AND redeployment AND healthcare workers within nine databases (Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO, MedRxiv, Web of Science, The Health Management Consortium database, Social Science Research Network, OpenGrey and TRIP), which took place on 16 July 2021. Analysis consisted of a synthesis of quantitative study outputs and framework-based thematic analysis of qualitative study outputs and grey literature. These results were then combined applying an interpretative synthesis. We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, and the review protocol was available online. Results Forty papers were analysed. These took place primarily in the UK (n=15, 37.5%) and USA (n=17, 42.5%). Themes presented in the results are redeployment: implementation strategies and learning; redeployed HCWs’ experience and strategies to address their needs; redeployed HCWs’ learning needs; training formats offered and training evaluations; and future redeployment and training delivery. Based on this, key principles for successful redeployment and training were proposed. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges to develop flexible redeployment strategies and deliver training promptly while following infection control recommendations.

In higher education, there are graduations related to Information Technology (IT), where students are expected to develop technical skills, including cybersecurity. Thus, it is relevant to assess students' cybersecurity awareness regarding cybersecurity hygiene and cyber threats when they start their academic studies and to verify whether there are context-dependent differences. This paper presents the results of an assessment regarding the cybersecurity awareness level of 110 first-year students from computer science graduations from two different countries, Poland and Portugal. The assessment was designed as a survey divided into the following two main groups of questions: (1) awareness regarding cybersecurity hygiene and (2) awareness regarding major cyber threats considered in the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) 2021 cyber threat report. The survey results show that Polish and Portuguese students present different self-perceptions and knowledge regarding cybersecurity hygiene and knowledge of cybersecurity. In these areas, Polish students are generally more confident than Portuguese students. Also, Polish students presented better scores around 70%, against the ones obtained by the Portuguese students, scoring around 58%.",Computer Science Symposium in Russia,2023.0,3,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CSR57506.2023.10224910?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CSR57506.2023.10224910, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We aimed to systematically investigate FSFW’s activities and outputs, comparing these with previous industry attempts to influence science, as identified in the recently developed typology of corporate influence on science, the Science for Profit Model (SPM). Design We prospectively collected data on FSFW over a 4-year period, 2017–2021, and used document analysis to assess whether FSFW’s activities mirror practices tobacco and other industries have historically used to shape science in their own interests. We used the SPM as an analytical framework, working deductively to search for use of the strategies it identifies, and inductively to search for any additional strategies. Results Marked similarities between FSFW’s practices and previous corporate attempts to influence science were observed, including: producing tobacco industry-friendly research and opinion; obscuring industry involvement in science; funding third parties which denigrate science and scientists that may threaten industry profitability; and promoting tobacco industry credibility. Conclusions Our paper identifies FSFW as a new vehicle for agnogenesis, indicating that, over 70 years since the tobacco industry began to manipulate science, efforts to protect science from its interference remain inadequate.

eba150b097f68c97e2ca6e4462f1d65accb3a81a,Estimating the range of incremental cost-effectiveness thresholds for healthcare based on willingness to pay and GDP per capita: A systematic review,"Background Decision-making in healthcare policy involves assessing both costs and benefits. In determining the cost-effectiveness (CE) threshold, willingness to pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), GDP per capita, and other factors are important. However, the relationship between WTP/QALY or GDP per capita and the CE threshold is unclear. It is important to clarify the relationship between WTP/QALY and GDP to provide a clear basis for setting the CE threshold. Objective The purpose of this study was to compare WTP/QALY and GDP per capita, and to develop a new CE threshold range based on WTP using GDP per capita. The relationship between WTP/QALY and healthy life expectancy (HALE) was also investigated. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science from 1980/01/01 to 2020/12/31 using the following selection criteria (latest search: Dec 2021):1, studies that estimated WTP/QALY; 2, the general population was surveyed; 3, the article was in English. From the collected articles, we obtained average values of WTP/QALY for various countries and compared WTP/QALY with GDP per capita. The correlation between WTP/QALY and HALE was also examined. Results We identified 20 papers from 17 countries. Comparison of mean WTP/QALY values with GDP per capita showed that most WTP/QALY values were in the range of 0.5–1.5 times GDP per capita, though the median values were less than 0.5 times. Comparison of WTP/QALY with HALE showed a statistically significant positive correlation when Taiwan was excluded as an outlier. Conclusions Our results suggest a CE threshold range of 0.5–1.5 times GDP per capita is appropriate but lower than the WHO-recommended range of 1–3 times. The correlation between WTP/QALY and HALE suggests that investment in healthcare is reflected in an increased healthy life expectancy. Since WTP is based on consumer preferences, this range could be used to set a generally acceptable criterion.",PLoS ONE,2022.0,53,"{'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266934&type=printable', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9009631, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Results The initial database searches yielded 409 articles, but 103 were removed as duplicates. Eventually, 30 eligible studies remained for analysis, the majority of which were case-control ( n  = 22, 73%). Regarding the applied technology/hardware equipment, VR ( n  = 27; 90%), head-mounted displays ( n  = 19, 63%), VR-based continuous performance tests (VR-CPT) ( n  = 21, 70%) were most frequently used. Most studies ( n  = 21, 70%) used the DSM criteria for the diagnosis of childhood ADHD. They primarily evaluated the utility of these technologies in assessing ADHD symptoms ( n  = 10, 33%) and improving the ADHD diagnostic process ( n  = 7, 23%). Conclusion This comprehensive overview evaluated the studies on the use of VR, AR, and MR technologies for children with ADHD. These technologies seem to be promising tools for improving the diagnosis and management of ADHD in this population.",BMC Psychiatry,2022.0,48,"{'url': 'https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12888-021-03632-1', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8728980, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The latest estimate revealed that stroke is currently the second leading cause of death worldwide. Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI), one of the major complications after stroke, is frequently underdiagnosed. However, stroke has been reported to increase the risk of cognitive impairment by at least five to eight times. In recent decades, peripheral blood molecular biomarkers for stroke have emerged as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic targets. In this study, we aimed to evaluate some blood-derived proteins for stroke, especially related to brain damage and cognitive impairments, by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis and discussing the possibility of these proteins as biomarkers for PSCI. Articles published before 26 July 2021 were searched in PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify all relevant studies reporting blood biomarkers in patients with stroke. Among 1820 articles, 40 were finally identified for this study. We meta-analyzed eight peripheral biomarker candidates: homocysteine (Hcy), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), C-reactive protein (CRP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), uric acid, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The Hcy, CRP, TC, and LDL-C levels were significantly higher in patients with PSCI than in the non-PSCI group; however, the HDL-C, TG, uric acid, and HbA1c levels were not different between the two groups. Based on our findings, we suggest the Hcy, CRP, TC, and LDL-C as possible biomarkers in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment. Thus, certain blood proteins could be suggested as effective biomarkers for PSCI.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2022.0,61,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/2/602/pdf?version=1641559667', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8775398, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ebaa9e59fd4d515b5ab128dc22e4620ec4e12cb0,Systematic Review: Incidence of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Over 70 Years,"Abstract Context Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are known to be rare. However, there is scant literature reporting their epidemiology, particularly whether the diagnosis of PPGL has increased with advances in medical imaging and biochemical and genetic testing. Objective The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine the annual incidence of PPGLs and change over time. Design A systematic review was performed. Medline, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science Core Collection databases were searched to identify studies reporting PPGL incidence. Studies were eligible for inclusion from the database’s inception until August 30, 2021. Results A total of 6109 manuscripts were identified; 2282 duplicates were excluded, and a further 3815 papers were excluded after abstract and/or full text review. Twelve studies were included in the final review. The incidence of PPGL ranged from 0.04 to 0.95 cases per 100 000 per year. Incidence increased over time, from approximately 0.2/100,000 individuals in studies performed before 2000, to approximately 0.6/100,000 in studies undertaken after 2010. The mode of diagnosis changed over the same time period, with more patients diagnosed from incidental imaging findings, and fewer at autopsy or from symptoms. Conclusion The annual incidence of PPGL has increased over time. Much of this increase is likely from incidental identification of tumors on imaging. However, the epidemiology of PPGL remains understudied, in particular, in associations with altitude, ethnicity, and genetics.

fb8ad09e144ac02a303ff37741ecde69cc807dd5,Interrelations between construction ethics and innovation: a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer,"
Purpose
Many companies invest in innovations because of the inherent benefits, and research on innovation has increased over the year. However, the vast majority of research papers deals with purely technical matters. There seem to be growing concerns over ethical issues in adopting innovations in the construction industry. This extant review of literature aims to analyse the interrelations between the concepts of ethics and innovations in construction research to understand the advances of current scientific production and future lines of research.


Design/methodology/approach
Thus, this work presents a bibliometric analysis covering articles obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection Database published between 1995 and May 2021. A sample size of 5,786 research papers relevant to the study was evaluated using VOSviewer software.


Findings
The results of the analysis shed light on the evolution of the connection between the two concepts. The study highlighted Heng Li as the most productive author. The country with the most publications and citations is China. The most productive institution is the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The results revealed a limited intellectual exchange and lack of cohesion characterising the two concepts (ethics and innovation), resulting in a situation whereby innovation-related researchers tend to follow personal trajectories in isolation from ethics-related researchers in the construction field.


Originality/value
This is probably the most comprehensive scientometric analysis ever conducted to examine the theoretical relationship between ethics and innovation in construction. This study adds to the so far limited knowledge in the field and provides insights for future research. Overall, this review may spur future research on dyad investigation of ethics and innovative related themes in construction such as ethics and sustainability, ethics and sensor-based technology and ethics and innovative safety approach.

Despite eradication efforts, the burden of the disease is well-known in endemic countries and in countries where brucellosis has not been an important health issue until recently. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, diagnosis, and manifestations of brucellosis. Methods In this study, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google scholar databases were systematically searched to find studies published from 2011 to 2021. The search was conducted using text words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Terms on the prevalence of brucellosis. Stata software 14.0 was used for all analyses. Results Based on the results, the pooled prevalence of brucellosis was 15.27% (95% CI: 9.68–21.86; heterogeneity I2 index: 97.43; p < 0.001) for man and 15.33% (95% CI: 7.19–25.75; heterogeneity I2 index: 98.19; p < 0.001) for woman.

c21f47d337124b66c40f5687dfbd9bdb6a280493,How to embrace interdisciplinarity in sport science – An approach at the ÖSG Congress Innsbruck 2024,"Introduction
The 19th Congress of the Austrian Sport Science Society (“Österreichische Sportwissenschaftliche Gesellschaft, ÖSG”), held in Innsbruck, Austria, centered on the theme of” Embracing Interdisciplinarity in Sport Science.” The idea of interdisciplinarity in sport science has been discussed for over three decades and stems from its position as a cross-sectional discipline integrating various natural and social sciences such as training science, sports medicine, biomechanics, sport pedagogy, sport psychology, sport sociology, and sport history. More recently, sports economy and sports management have also emerged as significant areas within sport science. Sports science is characterized by its strong practical relevance. It often focuses on applied research, where interdisciplinarity plays a critical role.
Interdisciplinary work is a particularly important factor when approaching sport science from a problem-based perspective (Güllich & Krüger, 2022). Specifically, we argue that interdisciplinarity becomes crucial when we are trying to develop solutions for complex challenges in sport, the health sector, and society in general. For example, an interdisciplinary approach in sport science might merge aspects of psychology, physiology, and sociology with expertise of medical professionals to study and realize health promotion strategies. For the purpose of this editorial, we understand interdisciplinarity as a collaboration between individuals from different scientific disciplines but also from different professions with the goal of combining knowledge and methods to create new solutions for complex societal problems. This can range from the simple communication of ideas and experiences to mutual integration of concepts, methodologies, procedures, or data sharing (Zaiț et al., 2021). We think that sport scientists can and should take a leading role in such collaborations given their unique cross-disciplinary education related to human health, performance, and well-being. Leadership in interdisciplinary collaborations may be an opportunity for us as sport scientists to strengthen our profile and image in the society and to take responsibility in addressing societal challenges (Hottenrott et al., 2017).
In preparation of this year’s ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024, we tried to embrace this idea of interdisciplinarity in sport science. Before the event, we conducted an online survey across the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) to identify current societal challenges that sport science should address and help with developing solutions. In parallel, we assessed the perceived importance of interdisciplinary work among sport scientists and related professions. Potential respondents to the survey were mainly contacted through the communication channels of the ÖSG and its equivalent associations in Germany (dvs) and Switzerland (SGS). Consequently, respondents included sport scientists as well as professionals from other fields who follow or are part of the activities of sport science associations. The findings of the survey were used in three different ways and will be described in this editorial:

to summarize the most frequently mentioned challenges and topics that sport science should address and help with developing solutions,
to develop an “Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop” for the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024 where delegates transform the identified challenges into specific problems that can be solved, and
to compare the survey results with the content of the scientific abstracts submitted to the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024 and determine the alignment between the identified challenges and current research topics within the ÖSG community.

The survey – Current challenges for sport science and beyond
The survey responses were analyzed in MAXQDA 24 (VERBI software, 2021). The MAXQDA AI-Assist tool was used to suggest an initial coding scheme to group responses into categories. Two researchers refined the scheme into a final code set, independently coded the participants’ responses, and discussed mismatches to agree on the final code assignments. The survey yielded 176 responses, of which 85 were fully completed. Respondents (42% women) had a mean age of 40.2 years (± 13.8). Regarding their primary professional field, 34% identified as scientists working at a university, college, or research institution, 26% were healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians or therapists), 15% worked in the private sector including self-employment, 13% were students or educators, and 12% were either coaches, athletes, or employed within a sports federation. 91% reported that interdisciplinarity was a key component of their work.
The most frequently mentioned challenges fell into the category of “prevention and rehabilitation” (34%), followed by “job profiles related to sport science and exercise therapy” (23%), “sport science mission for research and education” (11%), “broader societal issues” (5%), “structural development of organized and non-organized sports” (5%), “inclusion and integration through sports” (4%), “self-awareness and self-reflection” (3%), “technological progress” (2%), “financing” (2%), and “elite sports” (2%; orange bars in Figure 1). Coding was not possible for 5% of the answers.
The workshop – Transforming challenges into specific problems
Building on the findings of the survey, we collaborated with the ikivox collective (Nyon, France, https://ikivox.org/en/) to develop an “Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop” held at the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024. With the help of ikivox who specialize in collective intelligence and collaborative design approaches, we designed a workshop with the following objectives:

to transform the identified challenges into specific problems that can be solved with innovative solutions
to experience interdisciplinary collaboration and new ways of working together
to position the Austrian Sport Science Society (ÖSG) as an enabler, bringing value to its members to improve exchange about sport science in Austria
to identify whether the teamwork could continue on some topics after the Congress with the support of the ÖSG

Eventually, 42 Congress delegates signed up for the workshop and could choose to work on one of the following challenges: “physical inactivity at the work place”, “physical inactivity in children”, “image of sport science in society”, “role of exercise therapists in medical teams”, “influence of menstrual cycle on athletic performance”, “health awareness in society”, “inclusion of bodily disabled individuals as participants in public sport events”, and “integration of girls and women with migration background through sports”. This format of collaboration may provide a framework for future interdisciplinary initiatives within the ÖSG and beyond.
The Congress abstracts – Comparing the identified challenges with actual research topics at the ÖSG Congress
Having identified current challenges for sport science, it seemed of interest to compare those challenges with the content of the submitted scientific contributions to the ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024. The Congress received 78 contributions including 60 regular abstracts, 12 Young Investigator Award submissions and 6 extended abstracts. Five section editors managed the peer-review process and drew on the expertise of 45 peer reviewers. Each contribution was evaluated and rated by two independent reviewers. Critical feedback of reviewers had to be addressed by the authors in revised abstract submissions. Following the revision round, 75 contributions were accepted for presentation at the Congress. The contributions spanned a wide range of research areas including “biomechanics, motor control & sports technology” (26% of abstracts), “sport psychology & pedagogy” (25%), “sports medicine, exercise therapy & public health” (20%), “sports physiology & exercise science” (16%), “sports sociology, economy & management” (14%). Of all contributions, 64 were presented orally and 11 as poster presentations while 65 abstracts were published in the Congress proceedings.
When applying the same code set to the abstract submission, we found a remarkable similarity to the survey findings in that 34% of abstracts fell into the category of “prevention and rehabilitation” (blue bars in Figure 1). However, we also found clear mismatches: the content of the abstracts focused much more on “technological progress” (21% vs. 2% in survey), and “elite sports” (15% vs. 2% in survey). Further, while 23% of the survey respondents highlighted challenges in “job profiles related to sport science and exercise therapy”, none of the conference abstracts addressed this topic, indicating a gap between perceived challenges and ongoing research.
Summary and outlook
At this year’s ÖSG Congress in Innsbruck 2024, we tried to embrace interdisciplinarity in sport science by taking a problem-based approach to sport science. Based on a pre-Congress survey, we identified key challenges within sports and society in general that should be addressed by sport scientists. The most frequently mentioned challenges were related to the topic of “rehabilitation and prevention”, specifically physical inactivity in children and at the workplace. At the Congress, delegates participated in an “Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop” to work on the identified challenges and transform them into more approachable and specific problems. Interestingly, the topic of “rehabilitation and prevention over the lifespan” was also dominant in a third of scientific contributions to the Congress, showing alignment between perceived challenges and research efforts in the ÖSG community. In contrast, the topics of “elite sports” and “technological progress” were highly represented in Congress abstracts but were not perceived as current challenges in the survey. In turn, more than 20% of survey respondents perceived challenges related to the job profile of sport science alumn",Current Issues in Sport Science (CISS),2024.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.36950/2024.4ciss001?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.36950/2024.4ciss001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study examines the impact of Anki usage in a medical school curriculum on academic performance. Secondary objectives analyzed individual Anki utilization and a qualitative assessment of Anki use. A cohort-control study was conducted at Boonshoft School of Medicine. One hundred thirty first-year medical students were enrolled in an Anki utilization training program from July 2021 to September 2021. Training included educational Anki courses and subsequent survey data collection over Anki usage. Data variables included all course final examinations, the Comprehensive Basic Science Exam (CBSE), individual Anki user statistics, nationally standardized exams scores, and Qualtrics surveys on student perceived ease of use. Seventy-eight students reported using Anki for at least one of the exams, and 52 students did not use Anki for any exam. Anki users scored significantly higher across all four exams: Course I (6.4%; p < 0.001); Course II (6.2%; p = 0.002); Course III (7.0%; p = 0.002); and CBSE (12.9%; p = 0.003). Students who reported higher dependency on Anki for studying performed significantly better on the Course I, II, and CBSE exams. Anki usage may be associated with an increase in standardized examination scores. This supports Anki as an evidence-based spaced repetition and active retrieval learning modality for medical school standardized examinations. There was little correlation between its specific statistical markers and examination performance. This is pertinent to physicians and medical students alike as the learning and preservation of biomedical knowledge is required for examinations and effective clinical care.",The journal of the International Association of Medical Science Educators : JIAMSE,2023.0,11,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40670-023-01826-8.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10403443, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The Glen Torridon campaign sought to characterize the geology of the area, seek evidence of habitable environments, and document the onset of a potentially global climatic transition during the Hesperian era. Curiosity roved 5 km in total throughout Glen Torridon, from the Vera Rubin ridge to the northern margin of the Greenheugh pediment. Curiosity acquired samples from 11 drill holes during this campaign and conducted the first Martian thermochemolytic‐based organics detection experiment with the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite. The lowest elevations within Glen Torridon represent a continuation of lacustrine Murray formation deposits, but overlying widespread cross bedded sandstones indicate an interval of more energetic fluvial environments and prompted the definition of a new stratigraphic formation in the Mount Sharp group called the Carolyn Shoemaker formation. Glen Torridon hosts abundant phyllosilicates yet remains compositionally and mineralogically comparable to the rest of the Mount Sharp group. Glen Torridon samples have a great diversity and abundance of sulfur‐bearing organic molecules, which are consistent with the presence of ancient refractory organic matter. The Glen Torridon region experienced heterogeneous diagenesis, with the most striking alteration occurring just below the Siccar Point unconformity at the Greenheugh pediment.

Argumentation is about the justification of claims with reasons and evidence. It is a way of reasoning in both science and religious studies. A current 3-year research and development project entitled Oxford Argumentation in Religion and Science (OARS), lasting from 2018-2021 and based in England, aims to develop, implement and evaluate a teacher’s professional development programme in order to nurture teachers’ pedagogical skills in teaching argumentation in both science and religious education. The particular interest is in understanding complex judgments, especially where they integrate judgments from the sciences and religion. Hence, a key component of the project is to compare arguments from the sciences with arguments made in religion drawing out implications for teaching and learning. The setting of the project is in secondary schools in and focuses on Key Stage 3 (or 11-14 years-old pupils). Thirty teachers from 15 schools, including a range of faith/maintained, religiously plural/religiously uniform[LlV1], as well as secular state schools are participating in the project. Overall the project highlights the need for teachers’ professional development to deal with complex argumentation that concern both science and religious education content.",,2020.0,14,"{'url': 'https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:94720d95-d4e1-4120-8d77-d1ea022167d6/files/rtq57nr03n', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/02607476.2019.1708624?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/02607476.2019.1708624, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fffe299b085b7cf07a232e385cf478e27d60f6f2,A Critical Computing Curriculum Design Case: Exploring Tribal Sovereignty for Middle School Students,"We report on our efforts to design an integrated computing curriculum for middle school students in Montana that is in line with the Kapor Center’s focus on culturally sustaining-revitalizing pedagogies. Montana provides a unique context for doing this work because a state constitutional mandate requires all K-12 students to learn about tribal histories and cultures through Indian Education For All (IEFA). IEFA centers around seven essential understandings about Indigenous peoples in Montana that are integrated across content areas. In addition, implementation of Montana’s CS standards began in the 2021–2022 school year. In the curricular design, we sought to bring together IEFA and CS standards with grades 6–8 social studies standards though a focus on food sovereignty, the right of a group of people “to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems” (https://nyeleni.org/IMG/pdf/DeclNyeleni-en.pdf). We are guided by the following research questions: (1) What are the design strategies and tactics necessary to make IEFA and CS content accessible to middle school students and their teachers? And (2) What are some of the challenges and limitations of designing culturally responsive-sustaining computer science curricula? To address these research questions, we provide an overview of the food sovereignty units we developed. We then share the strategies and tactics we employed to design the units. Finally, we critically reflect on the process of designing such a unit and our own limitations as designers.",Journal of Computer Science Integration,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/jnl-up-j-jcsi-files/journals/1/articles/45/658c0b0119cb6.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.26716/jcsi.2023.12.27.45?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.26716/jcsi.2023.12.27.45, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Studies that reported SIH incidence in AIS and examined risk factors for SIH and non-SIH patients were systematically searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from the inception of each database to December 2021. Article screening and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), and meta-analysis was performed using Stata. A total of 13 studies involving 4552 patients (977 in the SIH group and 3575 in the non-SIH group) were included. Meta-analysis showed that the incidence of SIH was 24% (95% CI: 21–27%) in the total population, 33% (14–52%) in North America, 25% (20–29%) in Europe, and 21% (12–29%) in Asia. Subgroup analysis by year of publication revealed that the pooled incidence of SIH was 27% (22–32%) in studies published before 2010 and 19% (14–24%) in those published after 2010.

We develop a novel methodological framework that fine-tunes LLMs with repeated cross-sectional surveys to incorporate the meaning of survey questions, individual beliefs, and temporal contexts for opinion prediction. We introduce two new emerging applications of the AI-augmented survey: retrodiction (i.e., predict year-level missing responses) and unasked opinion prediction (i.e., predict entirely missing responses). Among 3,110 binarized opinions from 68,846 Americans in the General Social Survey from 1972 to 2021, our models based on Alpaca-7b excel in retrodiction (AUC = 0.86 for personal opinion prediction, $\rho$ = 0.98 for public opinion prediction). These remarkable prediction capabilities allow us to fill in missing trends with high confidence and pinpoint when public attitudes changed, such as the rising support for same-sex marriage. On the other hand, our fine-tuned Alpaca-7b models show modest success in unasked opinion prediction (AUC = 0.73, $\rho$ = 0.67). We discuss practical constraints and ethical concerns regarding individual autonomy and privacy when using LLMs for opinion prediction.

Insulin, the first medication to be discovered for diabetes, is still the safest and most potent glucose-lowering therapy. The major challenge of insulin despite its efficacy has been the occurrence of hypoglycemia, which has resulted in sub-optimal dosages being prescribed in the vast majority of patients. Popular devices used for insulin administration are syringes, pens, and pumps. An artificial pancreas (AP) with a closed-loop delivery system with > 95% time in range is believed to soon become a reality. The development of closed-loop delivery systems has gained momentum with recent advances in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and computer algorithms.

Methodology: For the above study, sixty three students are selected purposively and surveyed using a pre designed self - administered questionnaire on digital eye strain. Results: Sixty three students are studied and tables and charts are made accordingly. From the table we can see that, digital eye strain is associated with number of hours exposed to the screen and number of days of device used. Conclusion: Digital eye strain (DES), also known as computer vision syndrome, encompasses a range of ocular and visual symptoms, and estimates suggest its prevalence may be 50% or more among computer users. Symptoms fall into two main categories: those linked to accommodative or binocular vision stress and external symptoms linked to dry eye. At greatest risk for developing DES are those persons who spend two or more continuous hours at a computer or using a digital screen device every day. Solutions to digital screen - related vision problems are varied. However, they can usually be alleviated by obtaining regular eye care and making changes in how the screen is viewed. In some cases, individuals who do not require the use of eyeglasses for other daily activities may benefit from glasses prescribed specifically for computer use. In addition, persons already wearing glasses may find their current prescription does not provide optimal vision for viewing a computer.",International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR),2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.21275/sr23802124139', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21275/sr23802124139?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21275/sr23802124139, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

BJC Sparks uses the Snap! blocks-based programming environment, which brings the expressive power of a general-purpose programming language without requiring mastery of the syntax of a text-based language. We take advantage of new Snap! features to develop microworlds: customized projects that simplify the blocks palette to further lower cognitive load. We designed projects that use Snap!'s multimedia features to explore data science, encryption, and computational media. We end with physical computing using the BBC micro:bit that students program using MicroBlocks. In terms of findings, we confirmed that it indeed was possible to capture the interest of middle school students with functional programming activities, especially through the use of microworlds. We were surprised at the strong student and teacher interest in our micro:bit lessons, which many wanted as a stand-alone unit. Finally, it became quite clear that multimedia and data science projects offer promising avenues for teaching functional programming through fun, engaging, and personally relevant activities.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3545945.3569842', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3545945.3569842?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3545945.3569842, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, due to the unending desire for perfection, computerized neuro-navigation-assisted cranial surgery has found global usefulness, especially in neuro-oncological services. Our initial experience and challenges with this technology was already published three years ago but it becomes expedient for an update. Aims and Objectives: To report a six-year experience with computerized neuro-navigation assistance in our neuro-oncology surgeries and services. Methodology: Retrospective review of all consecutive cases involving computer-assisted neuro-navigation diagnostic and resective brain tumor operation over a six-year period (January 2016-December 2021). Main study parameters: Clinical diagnostic procedures, operations, histological diagnosis, adjuvant treatments. Data were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics, and results were presented accordingly. Results: Total number of cases 111, Males 70 and Females 41 (M: F = 1.7:1). Age ranges from 8 months to 80 years. The commonest presentation was headache, nausea, and vomiting. Pre-op diagnosis: Intra axial tumors 70/111 (63%), Extra axial tumors 41/111 (36%). Operations: Resection/Debulking of tumor 86/111 (77,4%), with complete EOR of 65/86 (75%). Diagnostic Biopsy 68/111 (61%) with target precision of 100%. Common Histology were Gliomas 50/111 (45%), Meningiomas 41/111 (36.9%), and Metastatic 15/111 (13.5%). Adjuvant treatments and follow-ups were advised accordingly. Conclusions: With computerized neuro-navigation assistance, a wider spectrum of brain tumors were more confidently operated, and adjuvant treatments were easily deployed in line with a precise histological diagnosis for improved neuro-oncology services.

The research was performed at three Slovak grammar schools in the 1st year during the 2nd term of the 2021/2022 school year. This research employed the experimental approach with a quasi-experimental design that involved experimental and control groups. The research sample consisted of 218 students, and it was divided into two groups: the experimental group comprised 114 students (who studied using the 5E model) and the control group comprised 104 students (who studied conventionally). The intervention took place during eight lessons (four two-hour laboratory exercises). A set of inquiry-based activities for the “chemical reactions and equations” thematic unit verified via pilot research was implemented using the 5E model in the experimental group. The research used the following tools: the chemistry concepts test based on the revised Bloom’s taxonomy and a questionnaire to identify the attitudes of students towards chemistry as a subject. The chemistry concepts test results indicated that teaching with the 5E model was more effective than teaching without the 5E model in terms of developing cognitive processes. It affected all the observed cognitive processes (memorization, understanding, application, analysis, and evaluation). After teaching with 5E model, students’ attitudes in experimental group towards learning chemistry as a subject changed significantly. Finally, research presents some recommendations, including conducting more studies on 5E model-based strategy, cognitive processes, and attitudes towards science.","Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education",2023.0,8,"{'url': 'https://www.ejmste.com/download/the-effect-of-the-5e-instructional-model-on-students-cognitive-processes-and-their-attitudes-towards-13469.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.29333/ejmste/13469?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.29333/ejmste/13469, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

56a3c214fb562580dcb869cec415aebbd641f07e,A Review of the Far-Reaching Usage of Low-Light Nighttime Data,"To assess the current and future utility of low-light satellite data, this paper reviewed 1630 papers, presentations, theses, and dissertations using day/night band (DNB) data from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) imager and its precursor, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan system (DMSP-OLS) series from the 1970s through to the year 2021. By the way of a categorical system, we take inventory of the myriad applications of these data to a wide variety of disciplines, ranging from social to natural science, oceans to atmosphere, and biology to civil engineering. Papers from social science fields dominate this spectrum, pointing to the unique aspect of low-light observations in their ability to observe aspects of human civilization at night. We also look at the stratification between applications using natural vs. artificial light, the use of moonlight, and the context of the key earth climate system elements. In light of these findings, a discussion is provided for the future of low-light measurements. Since the start of the VIIRS series, there has been a rapid increase in interest in the use of these data for numerous fields, pointing towards a nascent field centered on the nocturnal earth system science that is enabled by these novel and newly quantifiable measurements.

This study aimed at comparing the long-term and short-term outcomes of RATS and VATS for lung cancer. Methods A comprehensive search for studies that compared RATS versus VATS for lung cancer published until November 31, 2021, was conducted. Data on perioperative outcomes and oncologic outcomes were subjected to meta-analysis. PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched based on a defined search strategy to identify eligible studies before November 2021. Results Twenty-six studies comparing 45,733 patients (14,271 and 31,462 patients who underwent RATS and VATS, respectively) were included. The present meta-analysis showed that there were no significant differences in operative time, any complications, tumor size, chest drain duration, R0 resection rate, lymph station, 5-year overall survival, and recurrence rate. However, compared with the VATS group, the RATS group had less blood loss, a lower conversion rate to open, a shorter length of hospital stay, more lymph node dissection, and better 5-year disease-free survival.

The aim of the study was to find out the opinions of students on hybrid education conducted at The Maria Grzegorzewska University and to compare it with traditional education and distance education. The subject of the research was, among others, the readiness of students to participate in hybrid learning, assessing its quality and other related experiences. The research used the method of diagnostic survey. The obtained results indicate that students rate their readiness to participate in hybrid education higher than the readiness of lecturers to conduct it. They see the possibility of using a hybrid approach to education and science, organization of education and health. They indicate convenience, organization and health safety as the most important advantages and social costs, student attitudes and technical problems as the most important disadvantages of hybridization. The article also presents the expectations of students in relation to the systemic sanctioning of hybrid education. It was suggested to use the lessons learned by developing and testing the effectiveness of a hybrid approach, the potential of which is undeniable and scientifically proven. © The Author(s).",International Journal of Electronics and Telecommunications,2023.0,5,"{'url': 'http://journals.pan.pl/Content/124258/PDF-MASTER/6-3820-12078-1-PB.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.24425/ijet.2022.141266?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.24425/ijet.2022.141266, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Design A quasi-experimental single-group design was used to compare pretest and post-test scores through computerised adaptive tests. Setting The setting was a nursing college in Saudi Arabia. Participants The study included 292 senior nursing students enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing programme. Intervention A comprehensive licensure review bundled with adaptive quizzing assignments was delivered over 15 weeks in the academic year 2021–2022. The bundle was guided by the elaboration theory, and it included 3-hour synchronous lectures every week and 23 adaptive quizzing assignments that covered weekly content. Primary and secondary outcome measures Students’ mastery scores and the percentage of correct answers were the primary and secondary measures, respectively. Both measures were collected in the pretest and post-test (exit examination). Additionally, demographic characteristics were collected in the pre-test using an online survey. Results The overall mean of the mastery score was statistically significantly higher in the exit exam (M=2.51, SD=1.70) than in the pretest (M=1.45, SD=0.44; p<0.001). Although the overall mean of the mastery score in the exit exam did not reach the cut-off score, students who demonstrated the required knowledge and satisfactory performance in the pretest achieved a mastery score above the cut-off. The percentage of correct answers was statistically significantly higher in the exit exam (M=58.59%, SD=9.50) than in the pretest (M=49.32%, SD=9.78; p<0.001).

c29a6064cf730fea85b9809beb942c701855be60,Improvements in swine herd biosecurity reduce the incidence risk of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in breeding herds in the Midwestern United States.,"OBJECTIVE
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a significant disease of swine. The purpose of this study was to determine whether application of a comprehensive, science-based approach to breeding herd biosecurity, known as next-generation biosecurity (NGB), could reduce PRRS incidence risk across a large commercial production company.


ANIMALS
Pigs (381,404 sows across 76 breeding herds).


METHODS
From 2009 to 2020, the annual incidence risk of PRRS in sow farms managed by the same company averaged 33%, ranging from 20% to 50%. To measure the effect of NGB on PRRS incidence risk, a retrospective cohort study was conducted from July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2023, across breeding herds managed by the same company. During the analysis, 2 groups of herds emerged: those that implemented protocols for all phases of NGB (NGB COMPLETE), and those that implemented all described protocols of biosecurity except for air filtration (NGB INCOMPLETE).


RESULTS
During the 2-year assessment period, 56 breeding herds were classified as NGB COMPLETE, while 20 herds were NGB INCOMPLETE. The PRRS incidence risk in NGB COMPLETE herds was 8.9% as compared to 40.0% in NGB INCOMPLETE herds. From disease year 1 (July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022) and disease year 2 (July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023), system-wide PRRS incidence risk was 8.6% and 9.2%, respectively. The association between NGB status and PRRS incidence risk for the 2-year period was statistically significant at a P value of .006.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Results of the present report provided evidence that improvements in biosecurity result in lower PRRS incidence risk under large-scale commercial swine production conditions.",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,2023.0,5,"{'url': 'https://avmajournals.avma.org/downloadpdf/journals/javma/aop/javma.23.08.0437/javma.23.08.0437.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2460/javma.23.08.0437?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.23.08.0437, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods From August 2017 to December 2021, at 12 ALS centers in Germany, an observational study on remote assessment of the ALSFRS-R was performed. In addition to the assessment of ALSFRS-R during clinic visits, patients were offered a digital self-assessment of the ALSFRS-R – either on a computer or on a mobile application (“ALS-App”). Results An estimated multicenter cohort of 4,670 ALS patients received care at participating ALS centers. Of these patients, 971 remotely submitted the ALSFRS-R, representing 21% of the multicenter cohort. Of those who opted for remote assessment, 53.7% (n = 521) completed a minimum of 4 ALSFRS-R per year with a mean number of 10.9 assessments per year. Different assessment frequencies were found for patients using a computer (7.9 per year, n = 857) and mobile app (14.6 per year, n = 234). Patients doing remote assessments were more likely to be male and less functionally impaired but many patients with severe disability managed to complete it themselves or with a caregiver (35% of remote ALSFRS-R cohort in King’s Stage 4). Conclusions In a dedicated ALS center setting remote digital self-assessment of ALSFRS-R can provide substantial data which is complementary and potentially an alternative to clinic assessments and could be used for research purposes and person-level patient management.

cb70fb99e005f98509a43be7e65cc5fba2c40ec9,Plant responses to high temperature and drought: A bibliometrics analysis,"Global climate change is expected to further increase the frequency and severity of extreme events, such as high temperature/heat waves as well as drought in the future. Thus, how plant responds to high temperature and drought has become a key research topic. In this study, we extracted data from Web of Science Core Collections database, and synthesized plant responses to high temperature and drought based on bibliometric methods using software of R and VOSviewer. The results showed that a stabilized increasing trend of the publications (1199 papers) was found during the period of 2008 to 2014, and then showed a rapid increase (2583 papers) from year 2015 to 2021. Secondly, the top five dominant research fields of plant responses to high temperature and drought were Plant Science, Agroforestry Science, Environmental Science, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology, respectively. The largest amount of published article has been found in the Frontiers in Plant Science journal, which has the highest global total citations and H-index. We also found that the journal of Plant Physiology has the highest local citations. From the most cited papers and references, the most important research focus was the improvement of crop yield and vegetation stress resistance. Furthermore, “drought” has been the most prominent keyword over the last 14 years, and more attention has been paid to “climate change” over the last 5 years. Under future climate change, how to regulate growth and development of food crops subjected to high temperature and drought stress may become a hotspot, and increasing research is critical to provide more insights into plant responses to high temperature and drought by linking plant above-below ground components.

 Land-Grant Institutions and Cooperative Extension Services seek to disseminate science-based information to the general public and strive to develop the next generation of agriculturists. Extension agents across Tennessee implement youth and adult educational programs to build the knowledge and skill sets of producers and youth. However, Extension agents differ in areas of expertise, leaving some counties with minimal ability to provide 4-H horse project members with sufficient content knowledge while agents in other counties are more well versed in equine-specific areas. Youth (n = 224) competed in the 2021 regional 4-H Hippology contest across the Eastern (n = 59), Central (n = 93), and Western (n = 72) regions. Youth competed within their age divisions, where junior (grades 4 and 5, k=60 where k represents number of participants within each age division), junior high (grades 6 to 8, k = 100), and senior (grades 9 to 12, k = 100) divisions competed in written exam and slide identification phases. Contest scores from the Tennessee regional and Eastern National 4-H Hippology contests were used to determine areas of knowledge deficiency. Nutrition, tack, selection, health, and breeds were categories identified as areas in which 4th – 12th grade youth lacked adequate knowledge and a training program and new curriculum was developed and delivered to county extension agents. Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS v9.4 (Cary, NC). Differences were found when comparing across question category (P < 0.0001), age group (P < 0.0001), and year (P < 0.0001). Nutrition questions were most often missed by senior and junior high youth (k = 7.8, 51.94%; k = 7.5, 44.22%) whereas junior youth missed training questions most frequently (k = 4.9, 54.14%). Of the 5 deficient topic areas, selection questions were the lowest percentage missed by senior and junior high youth (k =5.9, 36.81%; k = 7.1, 39.53%) whereas junior youth missed health questions least frequently (k = 4, 39.87%). It was found that training status had no significant on scores from year to year (P >0.05).

There is no systematic study analysing the role of forest management approaches on the nutritional status of forests, serving as a surrogate for their health and growth.We assessed the impact of ‘heavy thinning from above’ versus ‘no management’ on the foliar chemistry of old‐growth European beech stands on a calcareous site with cambisol/chromic luvisol soil in Thuringia, Germany.Macro‐ and micronutrients were analysed by serial foliar analysis of six trees per experimental plot over 13 years (2009–2021). To assess potential differences of foliar chemistry between the two plots and over time, a linear mixed‐effects model was applied.Foliar concentrations of all macro‐ and micronutrients were not significantly different between the two plots (p > 0.05), demonstrating that the management approach had no relevant impact on the nutritional status of beech trees growing at the calcareous site. Furthermore, all foliar concentrations were dynamic over the 13‐year evaluation period. Hence, long‐term forest monitoring is crucial to capture the complex interplay between the trees and environmental conditions.Serial foliar analysis allows for a reliable evaluation of a forest's nutritional status. The results indicate that either regimen, that is, ‘heavy thinning from above’ or ‘no management’, shall not pose any risk in terms of growth and stability. Our results add to the understanding of beech forest dynamics and may provide a further piece for science‐based strategies of sustainable forest management.",Journal of Plant Nutrition And Soil Science/Zeitschrift für Pflanzenernahrung und Bodenkunde,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1002/jpln.202400144', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/jpln.202400144?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/jpln.202400144, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A long-term (since 1989) small-plot experiment was conducted on podzolized low-humus heavy loamy chernozem on loess-like loam (Luvic Chernic Phaeozem) in the experimental farm of the National Scientific Center ""Institute for soil science and agrochemistry research named after O. N. Sokolovsky” in the Kharkiv region in the conditions of the Left Bank Forest-Steppe. The experimental options include the composition, method, and doses of organic and organo-mineral amendments developed on the basis of leonardite with the addition of bentonite, molasses, and iron sulfate (and nitroammofoska in the organo-mineral) - 30 and 60 kg/ha in terms of nitrogen content. During the growing seasons of 2020 and 2021, we studied the seasonal dynamics of the following soil parameters: carbon dioxide emission intensity; organic carbon content; moisture content; temperature. Weather data taken from a weather station. CO2 emission measurements were carried out 4 times each year during the growing season using a portable testo 535 gas analyzer with isolation from atmospheric air. Within the arable layer (0-20 cm), the following were determined: the content of organic carbon in the soil by the oxidimetric method, the moisture content by the gravimetric method; the soil temperature measured with a Savinov thermometer. The results of the research have established a clear seasonal dynamics of the soil's ability to produce CO2 (from 0.1 to 2.0 kg/ha per hour) with a maximum in the spring and a gradual weakening by autumn, which is explained by the influence of weather conditions and the soil microclimate. A predictive model of the dependence of the intensity of CO2 emissions on the parameters of soil temperature and humidity is proposed. Compared to seasonal changes in CO2 emissions, the differences caused by the use of the two types of amendments are much smaller and manifest themselves mainly during the first half of the corn-growing season. The highest CO2 emission is with local application of organic amendment at a dose of 30 kg N/ha.The application of organic and organo-mineral amendment had a positive effect on the accumulation of organic carbon in the soil.The most effective method was recognized as the local method of applying a granular organo-mineral amendmentwith a C/N ratio of 5, in which the level of CO2 emission slows down compared to an organic amendment, and the total organic carbon content of the soil is the highest compared to other experimental options.It has been proven that carbon sequestration by soil, in addition to hydrothermal environmental conditions, is influenced by the composition and method of amendment, which can serve as a recommendation for the practical use of land improvement and fertilization agents in agriculture.",AgroChemistry and Soil Science,2024.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31073/acss97-04?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31073/acss97-04, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In total, 403 Clean Rivers participants completed a pre-survey, and a portion of them participated in one or multiple post-surveys throughout the years of monitoring. They were especially driven by Project Action motivations and Environmental motivations like tackling the source of pollution and doing something about the plastic soup, rather than being motivated by an Interest in Scientific Research like the desire to learn about scientific research. Project Action motivations increased significantly, especially within the first year of participation. Participants’ attitudes towards nature and science were initially high and did not increase significantly. Furthermore, while participants’ knowledge of plastic pollution was already high at the start, their knowledge of scientific research was not, and both increased significantly, especially in the first year of participation. The findings of this longitudinal study can contribute to improving the recruitment and retention of volunteers in current and future citizen science projects.",Citizen Science: Theory and Practice,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.5334/cstp.667', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5334/cstp.667?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5334/cstp.667, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

50f5148331a95d45cb643ef0ebb6624bee12b180,Conjoint Analysis: A Research Method to Study Patients’ Preferences and Personalize Care,"This article aims to describe the conjoint analysis (CA) method and its application in healthcare settings, and to provide researchers with a brief guide to conduct a conjoint study. CA is a method for eliciting patients’ preferences that offers choices similar to those in the real world and allows researchers to quantify these preferences. To identify literature related to conjoint analysis, a comprehensive search of PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was conducted without language or date restrictions. To identify the trend of publications and citations in conjoint analysis, an online search of all databases indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection was conducted on the 8th of December 2021 without time restriction. Searching key terms covered a wide range of synonyms related to conjoint analysis. The search field was limited to the title, and no language or date limitations were applied. The number of published documents related to CA was nearly 900 during the year 2021 and the total number of citations for CA documents was approximately 20,000 citations, which certainly shows that the popularity of CA is increasing, especially in the healthcare sciences services discipline, which is in the top five fields publishing CA documents.

397b3e8a06c22b96f98912bb3c438673ced28530,A nationwide evaluation of crowd-sourced ambient temperature data,"Growing concerns about heat in urban areas paired with the sparsity of weather stations have resulted in individuals drawing on data from citizen science sensor networks to fill in data gaps. In the past decade, a proliferation of crowd-sourced sensors has provided low-cost local air quality and temperature, with one brand having over 14,000 sensors deployed in the United States between 1 January 2017 and 20 July 2021. Although the air quality data from PurpleAir sensors have been widely studied, less attention has been paid to reported temperature. Gridded modeled temperature datasets are widely used in epidemiologic studies. The spatial granularity of the crowd-sourced sensor data captures local temperature variation which existing gridded datasets cannot, and can potentially be used to generate exposure assessments for health research. We compare temperature metrics reported by the dominantly used crowd-sourced sensor in the United States with a gridded temperature product, the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)-2, which although not a gold-standard measure of temperature, is widely used in epidemiologic research. We evaluate the lag between indoor and outdoor sensor temperatures. We report associations of the difference between outdoor sensor temperatures and NLDAS-2 temperatures, an indicator of degradation, and the duration of sensor operation. Finally, based on the temperature range recorded by the outdoor sensors vis-a-vis NLDAS-2 temperatures, we provide a list of 271 (2.5%) sensors potentially misclassified as outdoor and likely located indoors. We observed that the outdoor sensors agreed well with NLDAS-2 (R2 > 0.82). This association broke down under warm conditions (daily average NLDAS ≥21.1oC). Our comparison suggests that a radiative-correction needs to be applied to use crowd-sourced data reliably. However, the spatial granularity of the continental sensor network can reduce the measurement error in exposure assignment compared to the NLDAS-2. Indoor sensor temperatures lagged hourly NLDAS temperatures by 2 hours across almost all climate zones. The mean difference in hourly sensor and NLDAS-2 temperatures increased by 0.57oC for every operational year, suggesting that careful attention must be paid to degradation. Overall, we found that researchers should be aware of the limitations in crowd-sourced sensor air temperatures when examining extreme heat, or when aggregating sensor data across multiple years.",Frontiers in Environmental Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/fenvs.2025.1527855?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2025.1527855, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

On January 1, 2022, we used Web of Science to identify the 100 most frequently cited papers on clinical studies investigating anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapy, and extracted the following data: publication year, source title, country/region, institution, and the total number of citations. The research design and area were classified independently by the authors. Subsequently, we carried out a bibliometric analysis to determine the trends and identify the major journals on anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapy. The authors analyzed the current research hotspots based on papers published in major journals from 2020 to 2021. These 100 papers were cited a total of 138,840 times, and the median number of citations was 899.5 (range: 341–7,983). “Safety, activity, and immune correlates of anti-PD-1 antibody in cancer” by Topalian et al. had the highest number of citations (7,983 times). New England Journal of Medicine had the highest number of top-cited papers (40 papers), average citations per paper (1,558.3 citations), and rate of top-cited papers (65.6%). Authors from the USA contributed most of the papers (76 papers). Lung cancer (30 papers, 46,422 citations) and melanoma (20 papers, 30,881 citations) were the most cited research areas. In summary, anti-PD1/PDL1 has become standard treatment for various cancer, while adjuvant anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy is currently a research hotspot. New England Journal of Medicine was identified as the most influential journal in this area. Non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma are the most well-studied cancers, while nivolumab and pembrolizumab are the most commonly investigated anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies. Further studies are warranted to identify effective predictive biomarkers or models, clarify the molecular mechanism of combined therapy, and establish optimal therapeutic strategies.

Today, dinosaur science is experiencing a revolution thanks to these innovative techniques that stem from multiple scientific disciplines (Figure 1). In fact, young researchers are taking the lead in research with new scientific approaches (e.g. Falkingham et al., 2018; Lefebvre et al., 2020; Manafzadeh and Gatesy, 2020; Bailleul et al., 2021; Nieto et al., 2021; Serrano-Martínez et al., 2021; Van Bijlert et al., 2021;Ma et al., 2022; Wiemann et al., 2022). Young scientists are the key to bringing new perspectives into science and pushing technological and methodological developments. By publishing this collection we wanted to showcase this, and present high-impact scientific projects mainly developed by worldwide young researchers in vertebrate palaeontology. The innovative approaches presented in this volume will, not only advance palaeontological knowledge but also provide new tools to all vertebrate palaeontologists, since working protocols and tasks can be easier and faster to carry on with these techniques. One impressive example is the implementation of deep learning algorithms when automating image processing, like in the labelling and segmentation of computed tomography images or when osteohistological features need to be identified. Yu et al. analyze how deep neural networks can efficiently segment protoceratopsian dinosaur fossils, which can save significant time from current manual segmentation. In the case of the implementation of deep neural network-based methods, Quin et al. have tested this technique for getting segmented maps with different osteon regions on a histological dataset from various taxa within alvarezsaurian theropods. These works set an important base for analyzing larger sets of images and samples, but also developing more complex deep learning algorithms. It is a fact that the use of 3D models in descriptive studies and for soft tissue reconstructions is growing exponentially year after year. One really nice example is the partial ankylosaur skull from the mid-Cretaceous of Queensland (Australia), which Frauenfelder et al. have digitized by synchrotron radiation X-ray tomography and then reconstructed in 3D to facilitate the virtual preparation of the separate cranial bones. Although encased in a limestone concretion, thanks to this technique the palatal anatomy of Australian ankylosaurs has been elucidated, being indeed an important element in resolving ankylosaur phylogenetic relationships. It is essential to study well-preserved fossils when assessing anatomical features for descriptions, comparisons and phylogenetic analyses.

e53ca09d4b30a3fdea39001904fd077d7427e717,Building the cultural infrastructure of science requires unconventional approaches,"The 5th Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee fully recognized the country’s achievements in promoting the integrated development of urban and rural public cultural services since the 18th CPC National Congress. The National Action Plan for Scientific Literacy (2021–2035) specifically states that, by 2035, ‘the soft power of scientific culture will be significantly enhanced, and the allround development of people and the progress of social civility will reach new heights’. This shows that we need to constantly build infrastructure able to keep up with the growing demand for scientific culture, which is an essential part of public cultural services and an important dimension of the scientific literacy of citizens. Public cultural service infrastructure, represented by science centres, science museums and libraries, serves both as a window for presenting science to the public and as a vehicle for carrying scientific culture. Therefore, to meet the increasingly diverse and multi-tiered scientific cultural needs of the people, the cultural infrastructure of science should not only contain content with distinctive features and values and disseminate information based on local conditions, but also explore new pathways such as digitized and region-specific models of development to preserve the vitality of cultural vehicles. Although, in recent years, China has seen a significant increase in the number of facilities such as science centres, and the number of visitors has continued to grow, there are still some problems in the development of infrastructure. Institutionally, existing policies are fragmented, and effective interconnection between science and cultural venues is lacking. Behind the isolated development of various types of infrastructure is a lack of integrated and comprehensive planning due to the division of responsibilities among different administrative departments. For example, the National Action Plan for Scientific Literacy (2021–2035) and the newly revised Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Progress of Science and Technology have both stressed the importance of science popularization infrastructure, and the 14th Five-Year Plan for Culture and Tourism Development has raised clear requirements for the construction and development of public cultural facilities.

This study aims to evaluate the characteristics of frozen semen of Limousin bulls of different ages, which can still be used for insemination programs up to 12 years of age. This study used frozen semen of Limousin bulls ages 3, 8, and 12 years produced in 2021 at the Artificial Insemination Center in Singosari, East Java Province, Indonesia. Five bulls from each different age group were used for replication. Computer-assisted sperm analysis was used to determine sperm motility, viability, and abnormalities using eosin–nigrosine staining. Plasma membrane integrity was analyzed using the hypoosmotic swelling test. The acrosomes’ integrity was evaluated using FITC-PNA-PI, protamine deficiency using chromomycin A3, and DNA fragmentation testing using the acridine orange fluorescent technique. The results showed that the parameters of sperm motility, viability, abnormality, plasma membrane integrity, and protamine deficiency showed no significant differences in all age groups. The kinematic parameters (straightness and beat cross frequency) of the 3-year-old group were significantly higher (p<0.05) compared with those of the other groups. Parameters of acrosome integrity showed a higher prevalence in the 3-year-old group compared with those of the other groups. Furthermore, the DNA fragmentation of the 12-year-old group was significantly higher (p<0.05) compared with that of the other groups.

d5cbf9840a0611e8b410e8c272985cb77ecd2401,Investigating the Human Impacts and the Environmental Consequences of Microplastics Disposal into Water Resources,"During the last decades, one of the most contentious environmental issues has been the investigation of the fate of microplastics (MPs) and detrimental consequences in natural and water resources worldwide. In this respect, it is critical research firstly to track the ways in which MPs are determined as key anthropogenic pollutants in terms of ecological risk and secondly to plan feasible policies under which the role of science and society in tackling this global issue in the future should be prioritized. In this study, a systematic theoretical, technical, and planning analysis was developed in alignment with a Scopus search deployed in the second half of the year 2021 and covering a wide chronological range (from 1970s onwards) and thematic contexts of analysis by using keywords and key phrases organized into two groups. The document results were graphically represented, revealing the main scientific focus of studies. Subsequently, our study investigated the quantitative assessment methods of MPs in marine environments, denoting the range of standard procedures applied for collecting and analyzing samples of water, bottom sediments, and coastal deposits. The technological part of the study includes the presentation of the relevant analytical techniques applied for MPs tracking and monitoring in water resources, determining the wide spectrum of plastic compounds traced. Of particular interest was the determination of environmental depletion and human implications caused, even by extremely low concentrations of MPs, for marine biota, posing potential risks to marine ecosystems, biodiversity, and food availability. Finally, the research proposed the challenges of actions needed to support scientific, industry, policy, and civil society communities to curb the ongoing flow of MPs and the toxic chemicals they contain into water resources, while rethinking the ways of plastics consumption by humanity.",Sustainability,2022.0,18,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/2/828/pdf?version=1641991628', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/su14020828?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/su14020828, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

357bc854d07f867200722a5adf6a0ed6b8b9bf95,THE INCLUSION OF RPA IN THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION,"Over time, technological evolution has had an impact on all business organizations where the need to be able to constantly innovate in all the internal processes of your company is created. Today the commercial market is very competitive and causes companies to see a deeper horizon and adopt certain methodologies and new processes such as digital transformation.According to the consulting firm Mckinzey, due to the pandemic, it has forced many entities to advance this adoption of new technologies, including the optimization of some manual processes, which have to be automated, but before talking about these technologies, we will verify some stumbling blocks that the digital transformation has that we detail below. according to (Weaver, 2021): 1) The approval of the directors: This is the biggest obstacle of the 3 points because most probably the directors in their planning have invested technological tools that due to pandemic issues, these became obsolete, but according to studies at the beginning of the year 2020 ( KPMG, 2020), “67% of executives in the United States expressed a great concern regarding the migration of all their businesses to the cloud, however, this quickly turned from being a concern to a necessity where as a result , 70% of managers have an affirmation that the new digital models had a great advance as a result of the pandemic”. 2) Resistance to change in human resources: this concept is not new in the market, because the lack of communication between the project leaders and the areas involved is not very effective, resulting in an environment of uncertainty and doubts about what that is being done. This exclusion of the staff and not making them part of our project, makes many people resist change, being a great obstacle for our technological project. It is always essential to be aware that the new technologies that are being implemented will most likely be used by these users, but it should also be considered that our users are used to executing and carrying out processes that are well known and it is the change in their routine that generates some fear or discomfort. 3) Reduce dependence on traditional tools: for some authors, this point is the continuity of the previous one, since users know how to use the computer tools they have used for years and a new update means for them to start over from scratch. Migrating to new technological tools must mean that for the company it will bring many benefits, as well as improve the quality of life of its users. Contrary to the previous points, the benefits obtained in the digital transformation can be indicated according to (CMC, 2020):1) Faster response to changes.2) Improve the customer experience.3) Make better decisions.4) New business opportunities.5) Reduce risks.6) Increases the productivity of the company.7) It favors collaborative work.8) Promotes innovation.9) Advantage over the competition.10) Decentralization of work. The digital transformation combines three important aspects in its development, starting with an open culture, new technologies and constant processes. For the latter, they can be implemented in different ways, such as robotic process automation (RPA). For (ToBeIt, 2022), RPA ""is one of the keys to the transformation of companies since it is allowing the automation of superfluous and repetitive processes or tasks through specific rules"". With this definition, various types of services can be created that lead to 24-hour care without the need for human intervention, of course, that the objective of RPA is not to replace human resources but rather to be able to optimize tasks carried out by users, providing the opportunity for the user to carry out other activities where they involve some type of decision. The different RPA tools, some of them entail a certain degree of programming knowledge, but, however, there are others that are very friendly and/or are carried out through a natural language, making it possible for the same user to configure them and plan their execution, taking into account the following activities: 1) Security and access to the tool, through the management of credentials and the roles of each user.2) Compatibility with existing applications in the company.3) User interface, the application must be as friendly to new users as it is to experienced users. In order to implement an RPA tool, it is essential to evaluate the following aspects: 1) Identify those repetitive tasks that consume many hours of work.2) Design and parameterization of the optimized workflow.3) Planning the implementation of the RPA tool together with constant monitoring of its execution. The benefits of implementing an RPA are: 1) Realization and execution of tasks 24*7 without the need for human intervention.2) Greater efficiency between 50% and 90% of current processes.3) Time savings, since the robot is much faster than human action.4) Because it has no human intervention, it can be said that the RPA has a margin of error of 0%.5) An RPA can be implemented without the intervention of a company IT team. According to the magic square of Garther 2021 ""estimates that 85% of companies with revenues greater than 1,000 million dollars will have deployed RPA by the end of the year 2022, a percentage that at the end of 2018 was 60%"". Another very important fact is that a study by (Hidalgo, 2022) indicates that ""in 2021, the business volume linked to this technology has been approximately $2B and an exponential growth of the RPA market is expected until it reaches a volume of 13.4B$ in the year 2030”. This information tells us that many companies are investing in RPA due to the benefits that they imply. In a report generated in (flobotics-io, 2022) it indicates that ""the use of RPA in industries, 38% is insurance companies, 36% is retail and hospitality, 30% is energy companies and utilities, with the same percentage is in health care companies, 24% in banking and financial entities and finally with 22% in pharmaceutical industries and others”. The types of companies not mentioned, have a low percentage of participation, but little by little they are increasing to adapt to this type of technology. In a survey issued by Deloitte, 92% indicated that RPA met or exceeded their expectations while 90% indicated that they had improved quality/accuracy, 86% improved productivity, and 59% indicated that they had a reduction in cost. costs. Another important piece of information is that 78% of companies that have implemented RPA expect to significantly increase their investment in RPA over the next three years. There is another very important statistic where it finds that 63% of companies plan to engage with an RPA implementation partner, while 19% plan to use RPA vendors for support and 15% will handle RPA internally. Finally, I can conclude that the inclusion of RPA in the digital transformation is very important for the competitive advantages that a company can have, since with it they manage to optimize their resources and generate great business opportunities, without forgetting the new services that a company can provide to its customers to improve the experience and satisfaction of this.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER RESEARCH,2023.0,3,"{'url': 'https://ijmcr.in/index.php/ijmcr/article/download/517/434', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47191/ijmcr/v11i2.04?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47191/ijmcr/v11i2.04, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

42c3ed6e1c0b3a73e89df513c2f4a39fab0f45fb,The role of sport in research and development in Switzerland - An overview,"Introduction 
In Switzerland, around CHF 24.6 billion will be spent on research, development and innovation in 2021. Much of this will be financed by the private sector. The federal government and the cantons will contribute 21.5% in 2021 and finance research at universities with CHF 5.6 billion (see Körsgen et al., 2023). Sport is negligible in these statistics. This is at odds with the pressure to innovate in competitive sport and the economic and social importance of sport. Is there really almost no research in and on sport in Switzerland, a centre of research and innovation ? 
Methods 
This question was investigated using a mixed research method according to Creswell and Clark (2011). In a first step, the data from the 2019 Swiss Performance Sport Study (Kempf et. all 2021) were updated using desk research. In a second step, targeted searches were conducted in various databases (SNSF and ARAMIS) with a semantic keyword-based search for sport. In addition, a patent search was conducted in the database of the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property using terms related to sport. The results obtained were discussed with experts. 
Results 
Research and development in and with sport plays a minor role in Switzerland. Sport is barely visible institutionally at universities, universities of applied sciences or teacher training colleges. Sport hardly benefits from federal funding. With acquired funds of CHF 5 million from the SNSF funding pools and CHF 2 million from Innosuisse, sport benefits only marginally. Research and development seem to play a subordinate role in the private sector; only patents indicate that research and development play a certain level of activity. 
For sport, the possibilities remain in departmental research. With the EHSM, the Confederation has its own research institution. The Confederation also distributes means for sport specific purposes. CHF 2 million are available each year. The associations receive the lion's share of these funds (CHF 1.5 million). The ""Sport Innovations Hub"" of Swiss Olympic now has CHF 1 million at its disposal for association projects. This fund is financed by lottery money. 
Discussion/Conclusion 
Research, development and innovation are important success factors for sport. As sports federations play an important rule, it is necessary firstly to strengthen the sports federations as important supporters of research and development themes. 
Secondly, the Swiss Federal Institute of Sports (SFISM) should be developed as a leading institution in the field of sports science in order to support networking among federations and to strengthen them in their preparation for the submission of projects to funding bodies in terms of content and cooperation with partners from research institutions and industry.

In Malaysia, homosexuality is prohibited according to culture, law, and religion. Thus, this group is reluctant to seek help due to the negative attitude of certain healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals’ negative attitudes towards this group may negatively impact patient care quality. This study aimed to identify predictors of health sciences students’ attitudes toward homosexuality. Materials and methods An online cross-sectional study was conducted among 307 undergraduate clinical students at a university on the east coast of Malaysia from December 2020 to February 2021. The instruments consisted of the Homosexual Attitude Scale Malay Version (HASMV), Self-Reflection and Insight Scale (SRIS), and Duke University Religion Index (DUREL). Results The mean (SD) age of participants was 22.91 (0.78) years old. The majority are female, Malay, and Muslim. Mean (SD) scores of attitudes towards homosexuality among health sciences students were 61.53 (17.06). Non-Muslims, final-year students, and those with higher self-reflection scores in central and southern Peninsular Malaysia displayed a more positive attitude towards homosexuality, as did students with a history of contact with homosexuals. Students with higher intrinsic religiosity scores were shown to be more negative towards homosexuality. Conclusion The attitude towards homosexuality of Malaysian future health practitioners leaned mostly towards the positive attitude towards homosexuality. These findings shall aid the relevant authorities in revising the curriculum to raise awareness about homosexual health, as well as arranging training programs.

25c4efcbd11b2ddf1a3a2a5f86dc3295aab378af,Long-term monthly 0.05° terrestrial evapotranspiration dataset (1982–2018) for the Tibetan Plateau,"Abstract. Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a crucial role in the water balance of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), often referred to as the “Asian water tower” region. However, accurately monitoring and comprehending the spatial and temporal variations of ET components (including soil evaporation Es, canopy transpiration Ec, and intercepted water evaporation Ew) in this remote area remains a significant challenge due to the limited availability of observational data. This study generates a 37-year dataset (1982–2018) of monthly ET components for the TP using the MOD16-STM (MOD16 soil texture model). This model utilizes up-to-date soil properties, meteorological data, and remote sensing datasets. The estimated ET results strongly correlate with measurements from nine flux towers, demonstrating a low root mean square error of 13.48 mm per month, a mean bias of 2.85 mm per month, a coefficient of determination of 0.83, and an index of agreement of 0.92. The annual average ET for the entire TP, defined as elevations higher than 2500 m, is approximately 0.93(± 0.037) × 103 Gt yr−1. The predominant contributor to ET on the TP is Es, accounting for 84 % of the total ET. Our findings reveal a noteworthy upward trend in ET in most central and eastern parts of the TP, with a rate of approximately 1–4 mm yr−1 (p<0.05) and a significant downward trend with rates between −3 and 1 mm yr−1 in the northwestern part of TP during the period from 1982 to 2018. The average annual increase in ET for the entire TP over the past 37 years is approximately 0.96 mm yr−1. This upward trend can be attributed to the TP's warming and wetting climate conditions. The MOD16-STM ET dataset demonstrates a reliable performance across the TP compared to previous research outcomes. This dataset is valuable for research on water resource management, drought monitoring, and ecological studies. The entire dataset is freely accessible through the Science Data Bank (https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00020, Ma et al., 2021) and the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (TPDC) (https://doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.271913, Yuan, 2021).

The world market for AD and ADD (androstadienedione) exceeds 1000 tons per year, which stimulates the pharmaceutical industry’s search for newer and cheaper raw materials to produce steroidal compounds. In light of this interest, we aimed to investigate the progress of AD biosynthesis from phytosterols by prospecting scientific articles (Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases) and patents (USPTO database). A wide variety of articles and patents involving AD and phytosterol were found in the last few decades, resulting in 108 relevant articles (from January 2000 to December 2021) and 23 patents of interest (from January 1976 to December 2021). The separation of these documents into macro, meso, and micro categories revealed that most studies (articles) are performed in China (54.8%) and in universities (76%), while patents are mostly granted to United States companies. It also highlights the fact that AD production studies are focused on “process improvement” techniques and on possible modifications of the “microorganism” involved in biosynthesis (64 and 62 documents, respectively). The most-reported “process improvement” technique is “chemical addition” (40%), which means that the addition of solvents, surfactants, cofactors, inducers, ionic liquids, etc., can significantly increase AD production. Microbial genetic modifications stand out in the “microorganism” category because this strategy improves AD yield considerably. These documents also revealed the main aspects of AD and ADD biosynthesis: Mycolicibacterium sp. (basonym: Mycobacterium sp.) (40%) and Mycolicibacterium neoaurum (known previously as Mycobacterium neoaurum) (32%) are the most recurrent species studied. Microbial incubation temperatures can vary from 29 °C to 37 °C; incubation can last from 72 h to 14 days; the mixture is agitated at 140 to 220 rpm; vegetable oils, mainly soybean, can be used as the source of a mixture of phytosterols. In general, the results obtained in the present technological prospecting study are fundamental to mapping the possibilities of AD biosynthesis process optimization, as well as to identifying emerging technologies and methodologies in this scenario.",Molecules,2022.0,17,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/10/3164/pdf?version=1652684922', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9147728, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ab816d096fd1924dd120bd764a40ec365fb48b38,A systematic review of the global prevalence and incidence of shoulder pain,"Background and objectives Studies reporting on the population burden of people living with shoulder pain show wide heterogeneity in terms of case definition, study samples, and occurrence. This systematic review aims to summarize evidence pertaining to the prevalence and incidence of shoulder pain, including variability based on sex and geography. We also explored the potential influence of methodological limitations and important sources of heterogeneity (case definition and reference period) on reported estimates of shoulder pain prevalence. Databases and data treatment The study protocol was registered on Prospero under CRD42021243140. We searched EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and Medline from inception to March 2021. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment was conducted by a team of three researchers. We performed a narrative synthesis of the data, using forest plots to summarize study findings, and stratified data presentation to explore the potential association of risk of bias, case definition, and reference period with estimates of prevalence and incidence of shoulder pain. Results We obtained data from 61 studies reporting data from high-, middle- and low-income countries. The overall risk of bias was low, with most rated as “low-risk” and no studies rated as “high-risk”. The community prevalence of shoulder pain varied widely across the countries included in our review, with a median of 16% (range 0.67 to 55.2%). Longer reference periods were typically associated with higher prevalence estimates. Primary care prevalence ranged from 1.01 to 4.84% (median 2.36%). Estimates were generally higher for women than men and were higher in high-income nations. The incidence of shoulder pain ranged from 7.7 to 62 per 1000 persons per year (median 37.8 per 1000 persons per year). Risk of bias did not clearly explain variability in study findings, but there was considerable variation in study samples, methods used, and a relative absence of data from low-income countries. Conclusions Our review demonstrates that a significant proportion of the population across the world will experience shoulder pain daily, yearly, and throughout a lifetime.

Discrimination analysis demonstrated 27 items to be excellent, 13 good and 5 having poor discrimination. Distractor efficacy was found to be 93.32±19.60. Out of 135 distractors, 129 were functional while non-functioning distractor (NFD) were 6.Conclusion: Item analysis is a valuable assessment tool that identifies better multiple-choice questions to be retained while discarding or reviewing the weak ones. Faculty development programs should be organized for improving item writing skills of faculty

33e339f70122d6aefa44444535bed9726d94f99b,Where Is the Artificial Intelligence Applied in Dentistry? Systematic Review and Literature Analysis,"This literature research had two main objectives. The first objective was to quantify how frequently artificial intelligence (AI) was utilized in dental literature from 2011 until 2021. The second objective was to distinguish the focus of such publications; in particular, dental field and topic. The main inclusion criterium was an original article or review in English focused on dental utilization of AI. All other types of publications or non-dental or non-AI-focused were excluded. The information sources were Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, queried on 19 April 2022. The search string was “artificial intelligence” AND (dental OR dentistry OR tooth OR teeth OR dentofacial OR maxillofacial OR orofacial OR orthodontics OR endodontics OR periodontics OR prosthodontics). Following the removal of duplicates, all remaining publications were returned by searches and were screened by three independent operators to minimize the risk of bias. The analysis of 2011–2021 publications identified 4413 records, from which 1497 were finally selected and calculated according to the year of publication. The results confirmed a historically unprecedented boom in AI dental publications, with an average increase of 21.6% per year over the last decade and a 34.9% increase per year over the last 5 years. In the achievement of the second objective, qualitative assessment of dental AI publications since 2021 identified 1717 records, with 497 papers finally selected. The results of this assessment indicated the relative proportions of focal topics, as follows: radiology 26.36%, orthodontics 18.31%, general scope 17.10%, restorative 12.09%, surgery 11.87% and education 5.63%. The review confirms that the current use of artificial intelligence in dentistry is concentrated mainly around the evaluation of digital diagnostic methods, especially radiology; however, its implementation is expected to gradually penetrate all parts of the profession.",Healthcare,2022.0,95,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/10/7/1269/pdf?version=1657270288', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9320442, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a42ed04670ccc777e4240593fba00886af270b6f,Developing relevant assessments of community-engaged research partnerships: A community-based participatory approach to evaluating clinical and health research study teams,"Abstract Background/Objective: In 2017, the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR) and community partners in Flint, Michigan collaborated to launch a research funding program and evaluate the dynamics of those research partnerships receiving funding. While validated assessments for community-engaged research (CEnR) partnerships were available, the study team found none sufficiently relevant to conducting CEnR in the context of the work. MICHR faculty and staff along with community partners living and working in Flint used a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to develop and administer a locally relevant assessment of CEnR partnerships that were active in Flint in 2019 and 2021. Methods: Surveys were administered each year to over a dozen partnerships funded by MICHR to evaluate how community and academic partners assessed the dynamics and impact of their study teams over time. Results: The results suggest that partners believed that their partnerships were engaging and highly impactful. Although many substantive differences between community and academic partners’ perceptions over time were identified, the most notable regarded the financial management of the partnerships. Conclusion: This work contributes to the field of translational science by evaluating how the financial management of community-engaged health research partnerships in a locally relevant context of Flint can be associated with these teams’ scientific productivity and impact with national implications for CEnR. This work presents evaluation methods which can be used by clinical and translational research centers that strive to implement and measure their use of CBPR approaches.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/9A18A07F0128CE6685668C457AC86ECB/S2059866123005447a.pdf/div-class-title-developing-relevant-assessments-of-community-engaged-research-partnerships-a-community-based-participatory-approach-to-evaluating-clinical-and-health-research-study-teams-div.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10260334, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d1643d1ccb1e5b0555340e2acf9356208789b5a0,What is happening in Sweden?,"Sweden has witnessed significant, fast, and sustainable evolution in the optometry profession over the past 3 decades. We recommend a visit to the webpage of Sancta Lucia Gilles for a fantastic compilation of the history of optometry in Sweden — https://www.sanctaluciagille.se/optikeryrkets-historia. In this editorial we share some exciting news about the optometry education and extended responsibilities for optometrists. After about 20 years of solid first-cycle bachelor education, Linnaeus University opened a new master program in optometry and vision sciences in 2021 (Linnaeus University, 2022). From September 2023 the bachelor education at Linnaeus University will be available from Campus Kalmar and Campus Gothenburg. Thatmeans an annual intake of about 75 first-cycle students and up to 25 second-cycle (masters) students per year. With an annual intake of 100 new students Linnaeus University will be a big player in optometry in theNordic countries. In parallel, the responsibilities of Swedish optometrists are expected to be extended by the Swedish authorities. We aim to shed some light on the impact of these developments on optometry education in Sweden and the rest of the Nordic countries. Recognising the evolving healthcare landscape and, probably, appreciating optometrists as a major asset for the chain of eye care, Socialstyrelsen (the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare) is planning to extend optometrists responsibilities. Socialstyrelsen is an agency under the Swedish Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Socialstyrelsen, 2019; 2020) and is responsible for ensuring the quality, accessibility, and equity of healthcare and social services. From January 2024 the main planned changes to the law that controls optometric practice are: (a) optometrists will be allowed to perform eye exams and prescribe refractive correction to children of any age (currently Swedish optometrists cannot prescribe to children under the age of 8 years), (b) the text “optometrists cannot touch the eye” will be removed from the law, and (c) the “contact lens license” will cease to exist as a speciality, that is, all optometrists will be licensed to work with contact lenses. In addition, despite it not being mentioned in the law, the current consensus amongst all eye care professionals is that optometrists must be more selective when referring patients to hospital care. In many cases, optometrists can follow up their patients themselves instead of referring them to hospital. This seems particularly relevant for conditions such as non-exudative age-relatedmacular degeneration and glaucoma (Landgren & Peters, 2021). The law will also include some updates about the vision assessment for driving licenses, but that has less impact on the scope of practice.",Scandinavian Journal of Optometry and Visual Science,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://open.lnu.se/index.php/sjovs/article/download/3989/3439', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15626/sjovs.v16i1.3989?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15626/sjovs.v16i1.3989, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e59d0afa17b5434d455c600b516efff8b0128db7,A Retrospective Study of Ectopic Pregnancies in a Rural Tertiary Care Centre,": Background: Medical professionals frequently encounter Ectopic Pregnancy (EP), a life - threatening emergency whose diagnosis is frequently missed. To avoid mortality and morbidity, every woman in the reproductive age group who exhibits lower abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding must be suspected of having an ectopic pregnancy. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was done in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of a rural tertiary care hospital at PES Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Kuppam, AP, India. All patients who were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy between January 2021 and December 2022in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology were included in the study. Results: During the two - year study period, among the 5273 pregnancies, 24 cases of ectopic pregnancy were detected, with an incidence of 4.55/1000 pregnancies. Most of the women were aged 25 - 30 years (41.66%), and 83.3% of women were multiparous. The two most prevalent risk factors were pelvic surgery in 13 cases (54.16%) followed by prior abortion in 10 cases (41.6%). Among pelvic surgery, 10 cases had undergone prior LSCS (41.6%), one case had undergone abdominal tubectomy (4.16%), one case had undergone salpingectomy for prior ruptured ectopic pregnancy (4.16%) and one case had undergone recanalization (4.16%). It was concluded in our study that as the number of pelvic surgeries increased, there is a subsequent increase in the risk of ectopic pregnancy. The traditional triad of lower abdominal pain, amenorrhea, and vaginal bleeding was present in 7 cases (29.16%). For all cases, urine pregnancy tests showed positive results (100 %).21 out of 24 (87.5%) were ectopic tubal pregnancies. Four patients (16.66%) benefited from medical management with methotrexate alone. Blood transfusion was necessary for 11 individuals (45.8%). There were no cases of mortality in the study. Conclusion: Identifying the risk factors, with a high suspicion index and a good clinical acumen aided with ultrasonography and early intervention can reduce the morbidity and mortality due to ectopic pregnancy.",International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR),2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.21275/sr23313105902', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21275/sr23313105902?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21275/sr23313105902, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

With only weeks of life left, these true bugs (Hemiptera) sing loudly to find mates, lay offspring, and then perish by the billions (1). Carcasses can stimulate soil nutrient cycling, soil microbes, and tree growth (2, 3), but surprisingly little is known about the real-time effects of living cicadas on food webs. On page 320 of this issue, Getman-Pickering et al. (4) combine focused experiments with community-science observations before, during, and after an emergence in 2021 to show that mass cicada outbreaks shift the normal diets of entire bird communities, thus indirectly increasing caterpillar abundance and damage to trees.

The experiment was conducted on twenty years old trees of sapota, Cricket Ball with foliar spray of different concentrations of plant growth regulators applied at 50 per cent flowering and pea stage of fruit growth. The experiment was laid out in Randomized Block Design with twenty five treatments, and three replication for each treatment. Thus, a total of 75 data collection made available at each time. Physical parameters of fruit viz., fruit weight (126.36 g ±31.07g), fruit volume (121.59 ml ±29.07 ml), fruit diameter (6.69 cm ±1.33 cm), fruit length (6.92 cm ±2.01 cm) and pulp weight (112.61 g ± 2.01 g) of sapota fruits were increased with the treatment GA3 @ 150 ppm, while, the peel weight (8.79 g ± 1.72 g) was reduced under the same treatment. The specific gravity (1.045 g ± 0.015 gml-1) was recorded maximum under the treatment ethrel @ 1000 ppm. However, a reduction in number of seeds per fruit                  (4.50 ± 2.08) and seed weight (4.38 g ± 0.78 g) was observed by the foliar feeding of NAA @ 100 ppm treatment.

Specific issues arise regarding data in image format, as this data typology poses particular challenges and opportunities; however, not much attention has been given to data as images. We reviewed 109 articles from several research domains where images were used either as data or metadata to understand how researchers specifically deal with this data format, and what are your habits and behaviors. We use the Web of Science (WoS), considering its five main areas of research. We included in the initial corpus the most relevant articles by research domain, selecting the ten most cited articles in WoS, by year, between 2010 and 2021. The selected articles should be in English and in open access. The results found that images have been used in scientific works numerous times, but, unfortunately, few are those in which they are the central element of the study. Photography is the type of image most used in most domains. In terms of the instruments used, the Technology and Life Sciences and Biomedicine domains use the microscope more, while the Arts and Humanities and Physical Sciences domains use the camera more. We found that the images are mostly produced in the context of the project, rather than reused by third parties. As for their collection scenario, these are mostly produced/used in a laboratory context. The overwhelming majority of the images present in the articles are digital, and only a small part is analog. We verify that Arts and Humanities are more likely to perform qualitative types of analyses, while Life Sciences and Biomedicine overwhelmingly use quantitative analyses. As for the issues of sharing and depositing, Life Sciences and Biomedicine is the domain that stands out the most in the tasks of depositing and sharing images. It was found that the licenses of a project are intrinsically related to the motivations for sharing results with third parties.

In 2021-2022 in the conditions of the Penza region, there were studied the seeding rates and methods of sowing of a new variety of awnless brome Udalets when cultivated for seed. According to the hydrothermalcoefficient, the growing season of 2021 was characterized as dry (HTC = 0.8), 2022 – as normal in terms of moisture supply (HTC = 1.0). The best indicators of the development of brome plants (mass of plants and roots) by the end of the first year of life were obtained using a wide-row sowing method with row spacing of 30 cm at a seeding rate of 5.0 million viable seeds per 1 ha. In terms of the yield of green mass and the collection of dry matter from 1 m2 in the first year of life, the wide-row sowing method with a row spacing of 30 cm had an advantage. During the year of awnless brome grass use the best indicators of seed yield were obtained by wide-row sowing method with row spacing of 30 cm at a seeding rate of 5.0 million viable seeds per 1 ha. At the same time, the number of productive stems was 106 pcs/m2, the length of the inflorescence was 19.0 cm, the number of spikelets in the inflorescence was 182 pcs., the weight of seeds from a productive shoot was 0.78 g, the weight of 1000 seeds was 4.26 g, which was 8.2; 8.0; 11.0; 13.0; 0.9 %, respectively, higher than the control variant with a row sowing method with row spacing of 15 cm at a seeding rate of 6.0 million viable seeds per 1 ha. The highest seed yield of awnless brome in the first year of use was formed with a wide-row sowing method with row spacing of 30 cm at a seeding rate of 5.0 million viable seeds per 1 ha (824 kg/ha), the increase over the control was 146 kg/ha, or 21.5 %. By a row method of sowing with row spacing of 15 cm, a high yield was obtained in the control variant (6 million viable seeds/ha) – 678 kg/ha. With a seeding rate of 5.0 million germinating seeds per 1 ha, the seed yield decreased by 7.6 %.",Agricultural science Euro-North-East,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://www.agronauka-sv.ru/jour/article/download/1416/693', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.30766/2072-9081.2023.24.4.656-663?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.30766/2072-9081.2023.24.4.656-663, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

S U T L IF F/ S C IE N C E ; (D A T A ) T O P 5 0 0 dustry,” Chang says. DOE changed tacks. It scrapped plans for Aurora, and replaced it with A21, a machine five times bigger. That pushed the launch date back to 2021, but because it was to be the first U.S. exascale machine, it also effectively pushed up the U.S. timeline by 2 years. Skipping the intermediate step of Aurora is risky, says Kenneth Jansen, an aerospace engineer at the University of Colorado in Boulder. “It means one of the stepping stones is not going to be there.” Still, others say it’s a risk worth taking. “This is the right way to do it,” says Thom Dunning, a computational chemist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Details of A21’s architecture remain closely guarded to protect proprietary technology. But scientists writing software for the new machine will be given detailed briefings on the new architecture after they sign nondisclosure agreements. Some of the first briefings are taking place this week in Knoxville at the second annual Exascale Computing Project meeting. Researchers already familiar with the plans say the machine is unlike any they’ve ever seen before. “A21 is a very different architecture,” Chang says. In general terms, he says, the design focuses on decreasing the need to move data long distances between processors, an energetically expensive process. He says the new machine will likely require 25 to 30 megawatts of power, only about twice that of Summit. Asked whether he thinks Intel will be able to pull off the new architecture, Chang says, “I am confident they will.” One outside challenge could be money. Congress has yet to pass the fiscal 2018 budget, and instead has funded the government through a series of continuing resolutions that keep funding levels the same as the prior year while forbidding the launch of new projects, such as building the A21 machine. For now, that’s not a problem, because DOE is still able to support the underlying scientific developments as part of its existing Exascale Computing Project, says Jack Dongarra, a supercomputing expert at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. But soon it will be time to start fabricating chips for A21, which is expected to cost between $300 million and $600 million, according to market research firm Hyperion Research. “In 2021 will the budget be there to do this?” asks Horst Simon, a supercomputing expert and deputy director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California. “I don’t know.” j",Science,2018.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1126/science.359.6376.618?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1126/science.359.6376.618, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f0bd2ba0ebaccb23bbd8b1bccb0688bb09e62858,Digging into Canadian Soils: An Introduction to Soil Science.,"Review Canada has a rich history of accomplished soil scientists who study the unique and relatively “young” soils of the country. Conversations about soil science education with Canadian soil scientists often involve the difficulty of teaching students about the soils of Canada and the Canadian soil classification system when the only commercial textbooks available are primarily designed for readers from the United States. There are an estimated 3,000 students who enroll in 63 introductory soil science courses across Canada each year (Krzic et al. 2018), and 80 postsecondary academic institutions in total that offer soil science courses (Diochon et al. 2016). Students at all those institutions would greatly benefit from a book that caters directly to the soils and soil classification system of their country. Textbook prices continue to rise, and students in soil science (Moorberg and Crouse 2017) andmany other disciplines are feeling the impact (Senack and The Student Public Interest Research Groups 2014). Open textbooks are typically free to students and openly licensed, often using a Creative Commons license (Creative Commons 2021a). Open textbooks are seen as a primary tool in the battle against increasing textbook costs. The book Digging into Canadian Soils: An Introduction to Soil Science (Krzic et al. 2021) is an open textbook that helps combat the rising costs of textbooks while also addressing the specific needs of Canadian soil science students. As described in the preface of the book, Digging into Canadian Soils was written entirely by members of the Canadian Society of Soil Science. It was written as a text for introductory soil science college and university courses and serves as a primer to the Canadian System of Soil Classification. The book was published in August of 2021 by the Canadian Society of Soil Science under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommericial 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC 4.0) (Creative Commons 2021b). It is available in both English and French; the English version was evaluated for this review. The book was produced using Pressbooks, a book authoring and editing platform (Pressbooks 2021). The book is available for download in several different formats, including a web book that is screen size-adaptive and can be easily read and navigated in a web browser on mobile phones, tablets, or computers. It is also available as a PDF optimized for print, a digital PDF that includes hyperlinks throughout the text, and as an EPUB ebook for use with e-readers. Importantly, the book is available to download as a Pressbooks XML file, which allows the book to be adapted for use by others who want to customize the book to suit the needs of their students. The content of Digging into Canadian Soils is well suited for an introductory soil science course. The 17 chapters are divided among three parts, Part I – Digging In, Part II – Digging Across Canada, and Part III – Digging Deeper. Part I – Digging In includes eight chapters that cover each of the major soil science subdisciplines and topics. Chapter titles include the following: Introduction, Soil Genesis, Soil Organic Matter, Soil Physics, Soil Chemistry, Soil Biodiversity and Ecology, Soil Nutrient Cycling, and Soil Classification and Distribution. These eight chapters cover the core lessons a student would need to learn in an introductory soil science course. Part II – Digging Across Canada includes five chapters overviewing the regional soils of Canada. Chapter titles include the following: Soils of British Columbia and Yukon: The Western Cordillera, Soils of the Prairie Provinces, Soils of Ontario, Soils of Quebec, and Soils of the Atlantic Provinces. Each of these virtual tours of the regional soils highlights the geology influencing those soils, their distribution, important soil types in the region, and applications of soil science concepts from Part I relevant to that particular region. Part III – Digging Deeper goes into more depth, as the part title implies, on soil science topics that have broad and growing interest. The four chapter titles include the following: Soil Mineralogy, Soil Health and Management, Soil Reclamation and Remediation of Disturbed Lands, and Digital Soil Mapping. Each chapter in Digging into Canadian Soils was written by experts in the respective subdisciplines, regional soils, or soil science topics. Despite the chapters being written by 41 authors and coauthors, the voice presented in the text is consistent throughout. The language used is straightforward and easy to understand; perfect for students in introductory soil science courses or anyone else exploring an interest in soils. The figures in all chapters are consistently of high quality. Each figure includes a caption indicating the original source and lists the specific copyright license for the figure. Similarly, each table in the text is of high quality, easy to understand, and well formatted using the TablePress add-on (Bäthge 2021) within Pressbooks. Teachers and students will enjoy conventional as well as novel textbook features included in this book. Each chapter begins with learning objectives. The text of each chapter is highlighted by breakout boxes titled “Can You Dig It,” which elaborate on main points from the text, identify emerging topics within the soil science profession, or introduce the readers to important Canadian soil scientists who made significant contributions relevant to that chapter topic. The summary section of each chapter includes practice questions and worked examples. A small detail included in each of the chapters that was appreciated is the “About the Authors” section, which includes pictures of each chapter author and their brief biography. This section helps students relate to the authors, but also highlights diversity within the scientific field. The book also includes a traditional glossary, but the web book takes it one step further and allows the reader to click on a term within a chapter, opening up a pop-up box that displays the glossary entry for that term within the same web page. This small detail will likely be much appreciated by most students in introductory soil science courses that are notoriously terminologyheavy. The content of this book clearly meets the needs of most introductory soil science students and instructors. However, the current lack of alternative text for images and figures is a hindrance for visually impaired readers. Alternative text provides descriptions of images to visually impaired readers who rely on screen reader applications to read books and web pages. There is no Canadian counterpart to the Americans with Disability Act (Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990), and such considerations are optional in Canada or regulated at the provincial level. However, with 3000 Canadian students likely to be assigned this book each year, odds are that a significant number of students will be disadvantaged by this omission. The authors are encouraged to add alternative text for all figures and have a librarian or an expert in accessibility review the text for other accessibility considerations as soon as possible. This book will inspire international interest. As an American soil scientist, the translations between the Canadian System of Soil Classification, the World Reference Base, and USDA Soil Taxonomy in Chapter 8 will be a regularly used reference.

5ef98651f95fcad875d15169d20af6cfa26bc8e0,Breast Milk Iodine Concentration (BMIC) as a Biomarker of Iodine Status in Lactating Women and Children <2 Years of Age: A Systematic Review,"Background: Iodine is needed for the production of thyroid hormones, which are essential for infant growth and development. Given that there are wide variations in breast milk iodine concentration (BMIC) and urinary iodine concentration (UIC), it is unclear if BMIC is associated with UIC in populations residing in iodine sufficient or deficient areas. Aim: To investigate if BMIC can be used as a biomarker for iodine status in lactating women and children <2 years of age. Methods: Electronic databases; PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus were searched until year 2021, for studies investigating the relationship between BMIC and UIC. Studies were reviewed for eligibility, according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by data extraction, according to the PRISMA guidelines. Results: Overall, 51 studies met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. BMIC ranged from 18 to 1153 µg/L. In iodine-deficient and iodine-sufficient lactating women, BMIC ranged from 26 to 185 µg/L and 15 to 1006 µg/L, respectively. In most studies, the categorisation of iodine status assessed by median UIC was consistent with the categorisation of iodine status assessed by median BMIC cut off of ≥100 µg/L, to determine iodine sufficiency in lactating women and children <2 years of age. Conclusions: The systematic review indicated that BMIC is a promising biomarker of iodine status in lactating women and children <2 years of age. However, these data need to be interpreted cautiously, given the study limitations in the included studies. Future studies should consider investigating the optimal median BMIC, as there is a lack of high-quality observational and intervention studies in lactating women and infants.",Nutrients,2022.0,12,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/9/1691/pdf?version=1650372803', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9104537, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We hypothesised that digitally excluded young people would demonstrate greater deterioration in their mental health than their digitally connected peers during this time. We analysed representative mental health data from a sample of UK 10–15-year-olds (N = 1387) who completed a mental health inventory in 2017–2019 and thrice during the pandemic (July 2020, November 2020 and March 2021). We employed longitudinal modelling to describe trajectories of adolescent mental health for participants with and without access to a computer or a good internet connection for schoolwork. Adolescent mental health symptoms rose early in the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest mean Total Difficulties score around December 2020. The worsening and subsequent recovery of mental health during the pandemic was greatly pronounced among those without access to a computer, although we did not find evidence for a similar effect among those without a good internet connection.

48d6a86b25cc7df44c0706c4272fc10e13edb804,Climate change and the threat to civilization,"In a speech about climate change from April 4th of this year, UN General Secretary Ant onio Guterres lambasted “the empty pledges that put us on track to an unlivable world” and warned that “we are on a fast track to climate disaster” (1). Although stark, Guterres’ statements were not novel. Guterres has made similar remarks on previous occasions, as have other public figures, including Sir David Attenborough, who warned in 2018 that inaction on climate change could lead to “the collapse of our civilizations” (2). In their article, “World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency 2021”—which now has more than 14,700 signatories from 158 countries—William J. Ripple and colleagues state that climate change could “cause significant disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies, potentially making large areas of Earth uninhabitable” (3). Because civilization cannot exist in unlivable or uninhabitable places, all of the above warnings can be understood as asserting the potential for anthropogenic climate change to cause civilization collapse (or “climate collapse”) to a greater or lesser extent. Yet despite discussing many adverse impacts, climate science literature, as synthesized for instance by assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has little at all to say about whether or under which conditions climate change might threaten civilization. Although a body of scientific research exists on historical and archeological cases of collapse (4), discussions of mechanisms whereby climate change might cause the collapse of The consequences of climate change are likely to be dire—and in some scenarios, catastrophic. Scholars need to start discussing the mechanisms whereby climate change could cause the actual collapse of civilizations.

571c9f9ff2ae5078f3ec4ef699e690e909f9152c,Supporting Conceptual Comprehension of Newton’s Laws of Motion of Grade 8 Students through Kotobee Interactive E-Module,"This study aimed to develop an interactive electronic module to support students’ conceptual comprehension in Science 8 and find out if there would be a significant difference in the performance of students after using the electronic module. The e-module was composed of three topics with three sub-lessons in Newton’s Laws of Motion. The participants were Grade 8 students and enrolled in the school year 2020-2021. Students from four different sections were divided into two groups: the controlled group (printed module) and the experimental group (e-module). The e-module was validated by nine experts for its content validation. Re-sults showed that the pretest scores of the students in both the controlled and experimental groups had a remark of average mastery. The post-test mean scores showed a large difference between the two groups as the students using printed modules remained at average mastery level while students taking the e-module were moving toward mastery. T-test results also found that the pretest scores of the students using both methods of instruction were statistically significantly different from their post-test scores. The e-modules group had improved and increased gain scores in their posttest compared to the printed modules group. Still, both modules, whether printed or e-modules, contribute to the increased performance of the students. Moreover, the developed interactive e-module using Kotobee Author software met the criteria set for evalua-ting its validity in terms of material worthiness, media feasibility, and language eligibility in supporting students' conceptual comprehension of Newton’s Laws of Motion. Overall, the value of the study was to search for the most effective ways of applying e-learning module in the learning process. Also, the study employed the effectiveness of using the e-module in the development of science teaching and by providing alternative ways to properly utilize the use of e-module in addressing and solving issues and problems in the teaching and learning process.

1dc2f524a7fcc479ad162b3d5045ba70d2efcb8f,Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques in the Classification of Parkinson’s Desease Sufferers,"Parkinson's disease is a progressive and relatively common neurodegenerative  disorder in the central nervous system where sufferers can have difficulty moving. This disease has a high mortality rate in the world of around 9.3 million in 2021. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, it is estimated that as many as 12,980 people die every year due to Parkinson's cases. This increase in cases of death is due to the lack of information about the initial symptoms and dangers of the disease, besides it is important to know how to prevent it early.  Early detection of Parkinson's disease can prevent symptoms of a certain age thereby increasing life expectancy. The existence of a computer-based system for diagnosing Parkinson's disease is called a classification system where the system applies the Machine Learning method. This study aims to compare the performance of algorithms in the classification system of people with computer diseases. In this study, it used methods in  Machine Learning such as K-NN, Multi Layer Percepteron (MLP), Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM).  The data set in this study was obtained using the Weka application.  The dataset used was Parkinson's Disease data  totaling 195 rows of data taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository Datasets.  The results  of the experiment based on the four algorithms showed that  the poor performance was the Multi Layer Percepteron approach  to regression data with an RSME value of 0.459.  Meanwhile, the k-Neural Network Algorithm  is a good classification technique forParkinson's problem with an RMSE value of 0.1895.","Journal of Computer Networks, Architecture and High Performance Computing",2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://jurnal.itscience.org/index.php/CNAPC/article/download/2035/1508', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47709/cnahpc.v5i1.2035?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47709/cnahpc.v5i1.2035, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aims to determine the effect of social science learning outcomes on students when an active the learning cell learning strategy is applied using card media in class VII at SMP Negeri 1 Gempol, Cirebon Regency, for the academic year 2021/2022. This type of research is quasi-experimental. The research population consisted of 64 students consisting of class VII A to VII G. Sampling was determined using purposive sampling and the selected ones were VII A (as the control class) and class VII B (as the experimental class). The research data was obtained using a questionnaire instrument that included how to apply the steps of the active the learning cell strategy with the aid of card media, along with pre-test and post-test research instruments to determine student learning outcomes. From the results of the study, it is known that in the distribution of the questionnaire the application of the active the learning cell strategy got an average score of 91.75%. The score of 91.75% is in the ""very good"" criteria. so that the implementation of the active the learning cell strategy steps with the help of card media goes very well. The average pre-test value of the experimental class before treatment was 47.97 and the average post-test value of the experimental class after being given treatment was 81.97. The average score for the control class is 49.03 and the average post-test score for the control class is 73.66.  Thus, when viewed from the post test scores of the two classes, the experimental class using the active the learning cell strategy is more effective in improving students' social studies learning outcomes. And based on the results of the paired sample t test to determine the effect of student learning outcomes, the sig value of 000.0 <0.05 means Ha is rejected and H0 is accepted. So it can be said that there are differences in the learning outcomes of the two classes. This means that there is an influence on learning outcomes by using the active the learning cell strategy.

In education, it is viewed as a novel and innovative teaching strategy to use for augmenting the writing skills of the students. To ascertain such contention, this study explores the effectiveness of online blogging in enhancing the writing skills of Senior High School’ Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) students. The researcher employed quasi-experimental research design to examine the effectiveness of online blogging as compared to traditional writing. Grade 11 HUMSS students of Balite National High School (n=13 for experimental group, and n=13 for control group) for the 2nd semester of school year 2021-2022, comprised the respondents for this study.To collect the data, the researcher used an Assessment Writing Test in essay form as an instrument. There was a pre-test that was held before the researcher gave treatment to the experimental class and a post-test, which was held afterward. To make the data analysis, the researcher analyzed the data by using mean and independent t-test. The findings indicated that there was significant difference in the level of writing competencies as to focus and details, voice, and grammar and mechanics of the students but in other writing competencies such as organization and word choice there wasno significant difference in their pretest and posttest performance. Generally, the integration of online blogging was found better and more effective than the traditional method. Results suggested that the participants have positive perception and attitude towards online blogging, viewed this as a tool in improving their writing skills, and kept them motivated. Finally, this study recommends that online blogging should be part of the writing classes and be incorporated in lesson planning and designing curricula in senior high school.","International Journal of Advanced Research in Science, Communication and Technology",2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.48175/ijarsct-11923', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.48175/ijarsct-11923?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.48175/ijarsct-11923, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2bad1c82ed6d8b1850a2066512c3ff27f0c42acb,Influence of Nutrient Regulation on Ricebean (Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi and Ohashi) Growth and Dry Matter,"Aims: Within the realm of sustainable agriculture and its attendant issues, there exists a compelling need for a viable approach to cropping systems that integrates pragmatic and economically sound crop management tactics. This is imperative to uphold land productivity and secure a lasting provision of crops for human consumption. Acknowledging the pivotal contribution of organic manure when combined with chemical fertilizers in crop cultivation and the safeguarding of soil well-being, a research inquiry was formulated for a noteworthy cropping sequence. 
Study Design: Randomized block design. 
Place and Duration: School of Agricultural Sciences, Nagaland University, Medziphema. Duration: 2019-2021. 
Methodology: The study took place from 2019 to 2021 at the School of Agricultural Sciences (SAS), Medziphema Campus in Nagaland. The primary aim was to assess the lasting impact of both manure and fertilizers on yield and soil condition in a ricebean system over this two-year duration. In the second week of April in both 2019 and 2020, Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata), a green manure crop, was sown using seeds. After a 30-day decomposition period, this green manure was incorporated into the soil. Soil samples were collected from the upper 0-15 cm layer of each experimental plot and analyzed. The experimental field was laid out in randomized block design with three level of organic manures i.e., poultry manure (PM), pig manure (PGM) and farm yard manure (FYM) along with doses of inorganic fertilizers : 100% RDF, 75% RDF, 50% RDF. The treatment combinations included T1 : GM (Sesbania) + PM (0.7 t ha-1) + 100 % RDF; T2:  GM (Sesbania) +PM (0.7 t   ha-1) + 75 % RDF; T3: GM (Sesbania) + PM (0.7 t  ha-1) + 50 % RDF ; T4:  GM (Sesbania) + PGM (0.7 t ha-1) + 100 % RDF; T5:  GM (Sesbania) +PGM (0.7 t ha-1) + 75% RDF; T6: GM (Sesbania) + PGM (0.7 t ha-1) + 50 % RDF; T7:  GM (Sesbania) +FYM (4 t ha-1) + 100 % RDF; T8: GM (Sesbania) + FYM (4 t ha-1) + 75 % RDF; T9:  GM (Sesbania) +FYM (4 t ha-1) + 50 % RDF. 
Results: In treatment T1, which involved the application of a blend of green manure and poultry manure at a rate of 0.7 tons per hectare, coupled with a full dose of RDF, exhibited outstanding outcomes in ricebean cultivation. This resulted in elevated seed yields, improved seed quality, sustained soil health, and maximized economic gains for farmers in the foothill conditions of Nagaland. 
Conclusion: The substantial enhancement in ricebean growth parameters can be credited to the rich nutrient content and beneficial micronutrients present in poultry manure. combining Recommended Dose of Fertilizers (RDF) with poultry manure, known for its ability to boost nodule formation in legumes, improved soil fertility, fostered beneficial microbial activity, and promoted legume health, ultimately leading to higher yields. In contrast, farmyard manure (FYM) outperformed pig manure due to its balanced nutrients, microbial activity, organic matter, and positive impact on soil quality, creating an optimal environment for plant growth. Poultry manure's capacity to stimulate nodule formation, enhance soil fertility, and support legume health resulted in increased nitrogen fixation and improved yields in leguminous crops, fostering early root development and robust growth in ricebean crops.",International Journal of Plant &amp; Soil Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://journalijpss.com/index.php/IJPSS/article/download/4311/8521', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.9734/ijpss/2023/v35i244311?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.9734/ijpss/2023/v35i244311, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: All award data were collected from NIH RePORTER. All K99 awards and funding data in this study were limited to All Clinical Departments (ACD). All researchers (n = 1,148) and awards (n = 2,022) were identified through a K99 search from FY 2007 to FY 2022 across ACD. Historic trends in K99 awards and funding from NIH Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 to FY 2022 were investigated. An R00 dataset was generated from NIH RePORTER. The K99 to R00 achievement statistics from FY 2007 to FY 2022 was investigated. NIH annual datafiles for FY 2007 to FY 2021 were aggregated to generate a master datafile of all R01 (n = 395,505) and R21 awards (n = 61,766). R01 and R21 award data were linked to the researcher previously identified through the K99 search. The connection between K99/R00 awardees and subsequent R01 or R21 awards was focused on. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: From FY 2008 to FY 2022, the number of K99 awards per year increased 123.4%, from 94 to 210. Over the same period, after correcting for inflation, the NIH K99 budget increased 127.0% while the NIH program level budget increased 17.3%. For researchers who achieved their first R01 or R21 0–3 years versus 3–6 years after the start of their R00, their average funding per year since the start of the R00 phase was $467,425 versus $290,604, respectively (p < 0.001). In summary, NIH investment in the K99 award pathway has substantially outpaced the NIH program level budget increase, and there is a strong relationship between average funding per year since the start of the R00 phase and time from R00 to R01 or R21.

The study's pre-exam and post-exam model was single group. 40 students from a public-school 8th grade students participated in the study during the spring 2021-2022 school year. The ""Scientific Reasoning Exam Skills - SRES"" was used to gauge the scientific reasoning abilities of the students before “Life science and Physical Science” course was taught using the research-project based learning approach and the SRES as a final progress check results. The 26 elements in this test are divided into 6 sub-categories Project-based learning is a student-centred approach that promotes active learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving through the exploration of scientific phenomena. This was accomplished in order to have a very solid result which will help schools to re-think in their curriculum design to make it more student-centered rand pee to peer rather than teacher centered. The results of the study's sub-problems can be summarized as follows: according to the sub-categories of proportional thinking, Hypothetical thinking, Probabilistic thinking and correlative thinking a significant difference was found between the SRES pre-exam total scores and post-exam total scores in favor of the pre-exam total scores. According to the sub-dimensions controlling variables and combinational thinking, there was no statistically significant difference in the pre-exam total scores.

Beyond this period, the virtual learning environment proposed a reevaluation of curriculum design and didactic strategies. The Classroom Laboratory NTNU-WUT Joint Course (CL) was introduced as a novel learning experience for students at West University of Timisoara (WUT) and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). This experimental course was proposed as part of the Romania-Norway collaboration and incorporates Virtual Project Based Learning (VPBL) in cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary online learning groups. This study aims to describe the learning experiences of Romanian students enrolled at WUT in the CL course during the 2021 – 2022 academic year. In a quasi-experimental design, 24 Romanian students participated in a seven-week transversal CL course, collaborating with Norwegian peers to develop a solution for a social problem. •• Students made significant gains in all three dimensions targeted by VPBL: skill development, self-regulation of learning, and group interactions in the online environment. In addition, the learning of students was compared based on the field of science they are pursuing (STEM and non-STEM). The results indicate that students enrolled in STEM disciplines demonstrated greater benefits from this instructional approach, as evident in their progress across the three dimensions of PBL.

The KKNI is applied to students starting in semester 1 of the 2020/2021 academic year. Where the types of courses and learning carried out are of course different from the previous curriculum. Implementation of learning with KKNI is certainly not as easy as expected. One of the obstacles to implementing the KKNI is the unavailability of the KKNI based lecturer and student handbooks that can be used during the learning process. Based on interviews with several science lecturers who were teaching in semester 1, the teaching materials used were still the teaching materials used in the previous curriculum.

4a91397b24cf12ef506f8fde90538e6f632a8e3c,Magnets and electric: Improving elementary students’ understanding on the concept of energy and force,"COVID-19 has brought a wide impact on the world including education. It comes with the difficulties of conducting the teaching-learning process and achieving the students’ comprehension and understanding of the subjects, especially science. It is worsened by the thematic learning model, where students are required to understand more than one learning concept in one learning sub-theme. The offline teaching, which is scheduled in the first semester of the 2021/2022 academic year is a momentum to reshape the thinking concept of elementary school students. One of the concerns is physics. Physics is very important in the development of student knowledge, because of its continuous application in everyday life. In addition, the use of natural science in secondary schools is wide. Another important point is that students have less ability to understand new knowledge. Therefore, practice is needed to support the learning of theories. Considering this problem, the team of community service of Engineering Faculty Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang used magnetic and electric kits to explain the concept of energy and force to students. These topics are difficult for students, and they need to learn them with direct practice. Learning using the physics kits, magnet and electric, made students can understand better the basic concepts of magnetism and electricity. Moreover, students can practice their motoric skills using the kits. Students can also develop their creativity and innovation by varying the experiments with the kits. Lots of practice with magnets and electric kits helped teachers to evaluate students’ ability and absorption of the materials. With this learning media, the learning provided by the teacher can be more interesting and fun for students. Therefore, students can improve their knowledge and skills in understanding concepts and their knowledge of physics.",SCI-TECH MEDIA Community Service Journal of Science and Technology,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ejournal.umm.ac.id/index.php/scitech_media/article/download/25865/12234', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22219/scitechmedia.v1i1.25865?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22219/scitechmedia.v1i1.25865, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2a253efd0a6174fb40de0a8c48f21fc464f9e7b0,Interim Safety Profile From the Feasibility Study of the BrainGate Neural Interface System,"Background and Objectives Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are being developed to restore mobility, communication, and functional independence to people with paralysis. Though supported by decades of preclinical data, the safety of chronically implanted microelectrode array BCIs in humans is unknown. We report safety results from the prospective, open-label, nonrandomized BrainGate feasibility study (NCT00912041), the largest and longest-running clinical trial of an implanted BCI. Methods Adults aged 18–75 years with quadriparesis from spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, or motor neuron disease were enrolled through 7 clinical sites in the United States. Participants underwent surgical implantation of 1 or 2 microelectrode arrays in the motor cortex of the dominant cerebral hemisphere. The primary safety outcome was device-related serious adverse events (SAEs) requiring device explantation or resulting in death or permanently increased disability during the 1-year postimplant evaluation period. The secondary outcomes included the type and frequency of other adverse events and the feasibility of the BrainGate system for controlling a computer or other assistive technologies. Results From 2004 to 2021, 14 adults enrolled in the BrainGate trial had devices surgically implanted. The average duration of device implantation was 872 days, yielding 12,203 days of safety experience. There were 68 device-related adverse events, including 6 device-related SAEs. The most common device-related adverse event was skin irritation around the percutaneous pedestal. There were no safety events that required device explantation, no unanticipated adverse device events, no intracranial infections, and no participant deaths or adverse events resulting in permanently increased disability related to the investigational device. Discussion The BrainGate Neural Interface system has a safety record comparable with other chronically implanted medical devices. Given rapid recent advances in this technology and continued performance gains, these data suggest a favorable risk/benefit ratio in appropriately selected individuals to support ongoing research and development. Trial Registration Information ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00912041.

70f896854b012d7a7f99a809e2f2f052c6ba9137,The Causality and Uncertainty of the COVID-19 Pandemic to Bursa Malaysia Financial Services Index’s Constituents,"Valued in hundreds of billions of Malaysian ringgit, the Bursa Malaysia Financial Services Index’s constituents comprise several of the strongest performing financial constituents in Bursa Malaysia’s Main Market. Although these constituents persistently reside mostly within the large market capitalization (cap), the existence of the individual constituent’s causal influence or intensity relative to each other’s performance during uncertain or even certain times is unknown. Thus, the key purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze the individual constituent’s causal intensity, from early 2018 (pre-COVID-19) to the end of the year 2021 (post-COVID-19) using Granger causality and Schreiber transfer entropy. Furthermore, network science is used to measure and visualize the fluctuating causal degree of the source and the effected constituents. The results show that both the Granger causality and Schreiber transfer entropy networks detected patterns of increasing causality from pre- to post-COVID-19 but with differing causal intensities. Unexpectedly, both networks showed that the small- and mid-caps had high causal intensity during and after COVID-19. Using Bursa Malaysia’s sub-sector for further analysis, the Insurance sub-sector rapidly increased in causality as the year progressed, making it one of the index’s largest sources of causality. Even after removing large amounts of weak causal intensities, Schreiber transfer entropy was still able to detect higher amounts of causal sources from the Insurance sub-sector, whilst Granger causal sources declined rapidly post-COVID-19. The method of using directed temporal networks for the visualization of temporal causal sources is demonstrated to be a powerful approach that can aid in investment decision making.",Entropy,2022.0,10,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/8/1100/pdf?version=1660128419', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9407104, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This places great demands on university teachers, whose technological skills have long been considered the most formidable barrier to the digital transformation of higher education (Børte et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a steep technological learning curve among higher education teachers. Overnight, university teachers were forced to adapt their teaching to a digital, online format to meet the needs of more than 1.5 billion students across the globe who have been affected by COVID-19 restrictions (UNESCO, 2021). Despite a great willingness to change, over a year into the pandemic, the frustration among (university) teachers has become apparent. A United Kingdom survey found that higher education teachers thought that their pedagogical practis had been “reduced to the fulfilment of rudimentary technical functions” and that they played more of a transmissionist pedagogical role (Watermeyer et al., 2020). Taking the perspective of the students, recent survey data from Norwegian higher education shows that, during the pandemic, lack of motivation and sense of loneliness have been an increasing problem among students (NOKUT the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education, 2020). From this we learn that a fully digital approach in higher education has limitations both when it comes to pedagogical practices and students’ well-being. A review of the literature in undergraduate science, engineering, and mathematics courses found that compared with traditional lecturing, active learning in combination with traditional lecturing, increases student performance and is therefore the preferred teaching practice in regular classrooms (Freeman et al., 2014). The same is true for higher education in general, where the literature broadly supports active, collaborative, cooperative, and problem-based teaching approaches (Prince, 2004). Despite this support, the adoption of active learning by higher education teachers has been contested for decades. A widely cited report on United States universities in the early 1990s concluded that the implementation of active student learning was obstructed by the powerful influence of educational tradition and a lack of coordinated institutional actions (Bonwell and Eison, 1991). It has been suggested that to promote active learning, institutions must take a more active role in changing teaching beliefs among academic staff (Antunes et al., 2021). Despite the high expectations to digital education, a review commissioned by the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research found that technology was most often used to support traditional teaching and that scholarly approaches that promote active pedagogies are lacking Edited by: José Antonio Marín Marín, University of Granada, Spain",Frontiers in Education,2022.0,28,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.784701/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/feduc.2021.784701?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.784701, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To ensure the sustainable development of the highway and shelterbelts, scholars have carried out a large number of studies on the shelterbelt since 1991. This review is based on a 30-year monitoring program from 1991 to 2021. We find that, with the increase of shelterbelt age, some ecological and economic benefits gradually appear, such as saving transportation cost, promoting economic development in Southern Xinjiang, improving the sandy soil and microenvironment, and increasing the biodiversity. In the meanwhile, some adverse phenomena also exist, such as high maintenance costs, decrease in water tables because of irrigation, threats of the protected species, pollution from pumping oil wells, and the potential damage from highway burying as sand dunes move forward. In view of these problems, some suggestions are as follows. First, the science-policy sections of both the UNFCCC and the UNCCD should pay special attention to providing research-based guidance for the international cooperation and coordination. Second, China government should provide the necessary funding to establish the 27th China desert observation and research station to ensure long-term monitoring and slow down the pace of construction on the desert highway to allow time to develop strategies that minimize the impact on wild animals. Third, it is necessary to apply solar photovoltaic power in well irrigation and sand industry development. Fourth, the sand-blocking belt of 10 m width and 10 m away from the outside of the upwind shelterbelt can be laid every five years in view of sand-buried roads.

fb596d9b0eaa5bb95c0c1ffac85f105c7bede079,Field Calibration of a Low-Cost Air Quality Monitoring Device in an Urban Background Site Using Machine Learning Models,"Field calibration of low-cost air quality (AQ) monitoring sensors is essential for their successful operation. Low-cost sensors often exhibit non-linear responses to air pollutants and their signals may be affected by the presence of multiple compounds making their calibration challenging. We investigate different approaches for the field calibration of an AQ monitoring device named ENSENSIA, developed in the Institute of Chemical Engineering Sciences in Greece. The present study focuses on the measurements of two of the most important pollutants measured by ENSENSIA: NO2 and O3. The measurement site is located in the center of Patras, the third biggest city in Greece. Reference instrumentation used for regulatory purposes by the Region of Western Greece was used as the evaluation standard. The sensors were installed for two years at the same locations. Measurements from the first year (2021) from seven ENSENSIA sensors (NO2, NO, O3, CO, PM2.5, temperature and relative humidity) were used to train several Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. The resulting calibration algorithms were assessed using data from the second year (2022). The Random Forest algorithm exhibited the best performance in correcting O3 and NO2. For NO2 the mean error was reduced from 9.4 ppb to 3 ppb, whilst R2 improved from 0.22 to 0.86. Similar results were obtained for O3, wherein the mean error was reduced from 13 to 4.3 ppb and R2 increased from 0.52 to 0.69. The Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) also showed good performance in correcting the measurements of the two pollutants.",Atmosphere,2023.0,5,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/14/2/368/pdf?version=1676293060', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/atmos14020368?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos14020368, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d6cd5dd4ef5b0301cb78202f6641800cd70901c2,The UWI Zoology Museum and Bioblitzing in Trinidad & Tobago: Mutual Benefits,"In 2012, as Zoology Curator for the University of the West Indies Zoology Museum (UWIZM), based at the St. Augustine campus in Trinidad and Tobago, I ran the first ever bioblitz to be held in Trinidad. Since then, an event has been conducted annually. Each event is organised mainly by staff and students in The University of the West Indies (UWI) Department of Life Sciences alongside members of the Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists' Club (TTFNC). A typical event would follow this basic format: choose a new location each year, find a basecamp, set up a search area (usually a 5 km radius circle), promote the event, organise survey teams, start surveying on a Saturday, invite the public along on a Sunday to get involved and then announce the results.
 Over the years, the bioblitzes have been attended and/or assisted by more than 30 groups and organisations. These included long-established bodies such as the Asa Wright Nature Centre, the Pointe-a-Pierre Wildfowl Trust, and the Zoological Society of Trinidad and Tobago; government bodies like the Institute of Marine Affairs, the Forestry Division and the Environmental Management Authority; and newer, smaller groups such as Trinibats, Turtle Village Trust, Environmental Research Institute Charlotteville (ERIC), the Reptile Conservation Center Of Trinidad and Tobago and The El Socorro Centre for Wildlife Conservation (ECWC) (Fig. 1).
 The way these groups contributed to the events varied from being basecamp hosts to providing animal encounter experiences, and from granting access to land and giving permits to providing expert wildlife surveyors. Organisations were usually approached by me with an invitation to join a bioblitz, depending on the needs and location of the event. Sponsors for the events were found by writing to local companies, approaching those who already had community funding programmes in place.
 I left the role of UWIZM curator in 2019, but the Trinidad and Tobago Bioblitz continued and evolved. In 2019, it followed the same pattern as previous events: the organisers partnered with a local school for a basecamp and the usual participants surveyed and welcomed the public. However, in 2020 with the first COVID lockdown, they had to adapt and so changed the bioblitz into an event facilitated online by using the iNaturalist platform: T&T Bioblitz 2020 Backyard Edition. At this stage, people were restricted to their gardens or streets so observation opportunities were limited, but nevertheless there were around 6,500 observations made of almost 1,400 species over one weekend in November.
 In 2021, restrictions were still in place for large gatherings but people could travel more widely, so the same online format was repeated. Observations could be made in some of the locations of previous events, which led to 2,900 observations and just over 1,000 species. For 2022, the event stayed online but became the Inter-Island Bioblitz as it went regional with participants from Jamaica and Barbados being invited. Almost 600 people took part and recorded over 1,300 species. Finally, in 2023, the bioblitz returned to the original format and an in-person event was again possible; this continued into 2024.
 The recording of results changed over the years. For example, the use of iNaturalist went from 9 observations in 2012 to over 6,500 observations in 2020. As I was no longer resident in Trinidad, I couldn't take part directly but though iNaturalist, I could contribute by identifying observations, as could many other international identifiers. 
 The majority of records made during the events were observations rather than the collection of specimens, but for some groups it was necessary to collect for further identification. Specimens collected were mostly terrestrial invertebrates, although sometimes roadkill and other specimens found dead during the events were also added to the UWIZM collections.
 After each bioblitz, a large banner was produced showing a summary of the results (Fig. 2). These were displayed at subsequent events and also as part of other displays in the UWIZM. Likewise, the trails and quizzes made for the bioblitzes were often used during the rest of the year for school groups visiting the UWIZM.
 Both in the lead up to a bioblitz and in the weeks following the event, the results are promoted in several ways: on social media (Facebook at first and later Instagram and Twitter), in national newspapers, on TV (usually getting a slot on a morning show), and through the TTFNC's Quarterly Bulletin, the final edition of the year being dedicated to that year's bioblitz. A T&T bioblitz website was made, which allowed us to collate all these outputs as well as access to the final reports for each event.
 Bioblitzes are fantastic events that bring together naturalist experts and the public. They should be a part of any natural history museum's repertoire, helping to promote and popularise the museum, as well as often providing a first exposure of citizen science to people, which can lead to a lifelong connection with nature (Fig. 3).",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.137368', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.137368?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.137368, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A survey consisting of 21 items was gathered from 146 faculty staff members during the first semester of the academic year (2021–2022). To achieve the objectives of this study, a questionnaire was used after verifying its psychometric properties. The results of the study revealed a moderate level of obstacles to teaching courses in distance education. Moreover, the study findings showed that the most prominent obstacles that face teaching distance courses are that online-tests are not fair in evaluating students, and the absence of direct communication with students affects negatively their understanding of the educational material. The research recommends that distance teaching should be addressed by providing adequate training for faculty members and using computer software such as presentations and interactive applications to eliminate boredom and increase students' interaction.

da754d2ae041eb498e7ef209c90e184cce51a568,Navigating the current landscape of ocean observations: an overview from platform infrastructures to networks related to ocean time series,"Increasing global temperatures, biodiversity loss, and pollution are among the major transformative changes affecting terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The marine biome can be observed and monitored using ocean observations with satellite-based platforms, tagging of animals, autonomous platforms and vehicles, and ship-based measurements. Sustaining ocean observations at a given location over time are known as ocean time series. For example, stationary platforms like moorings record data autonomously at one location over time, while ship-based time series stations are sampled using discrete measurements at varying sampling frequencies throughout a given year. Ocean observations feed into networks that either focus on obtaining data, e.g., similar instruments, or a social focus that aims to connect participants, e.g., early career or science-policy interface. These platforms and associated networks feed into the Framework for Ocean Observing (FOO) with a set of Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) and the Ocean Best Practices System (OBPS) developed by the global ocean observing community. The range of ocean observing activities around the world creates a complex landscape, which can be particularly difficult to navigate for early career ocean professionals (ECOPs). ECOPs face higher barriers to entering the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (“UN Ocean Decade”) than others despite actively contributing to ocean observations and playing the most significant role in the success of sustainability transformations. The review aims to provide an overview of the organizations and networks associated with ocean observations, motivate ECOPs to actively get involved in the ongoing UN Ocean Decade (2021-2030), and join or create new initiatives within the existing landscape. Ocean observations harbor an extraordinary benefit for a large diversity of end-users far beyond the scientific community, and there is a need to engage the next generation of ocean leaders as we transition to live and manage this blue planet sustainably.",Frontiers in Marine Science,2025.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1363863', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/fmars.2024.1363863?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1363863, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

520d2214b1db78a691c86f830b0b2af7a7bf48b1,211 Building a community of practice among research managers supporting mentorship research,"Objectives/Goals: The National Research Mentoring Network Coordination Center (NRMN CC) received funding from NIH to create an Online Community of Practice (OCoP) for Research Managers (RM). These RM contributed to advancing the research on the science of mentorship in STEMM. In a Proof of Concept, RM explored various aspects of their mentorship research support work. Methods/Study Population: An OCoP met 18 times across the 5-year grant to share experiences working to advance the science of mentorship in STEMM. Topics, frequency, and length of meetings were selected based upon several needs assessments surveys from the RM community. RM were invited to join the OCoP based on their roles as the point people for administrative activities in research projects (e.g., finances, budgets, training, and project management). RM often supervised staff, collected data, monitored IRB protocol compliance, and conducted research. RM played a pivotal role in the gathering and sharing of common measures across the 11 U01 studies to allow for greater confidence in research findings on mentorship (McConnell, 2021). Results/Anticipated Results: Our primary goal was to provide a supportive community for RM contributing to mentorship research and data sharing. The results from several needs assessments exemplified a request for this support from the community to engage in an OCoP focused on their professional development. Therefore, the OCoP served as a starting point to explore the duties, functions, roles and responsibilities of RM, and extended into providing professional development. Although the number of RM attending decreased as the grant entered the no-cost extension phase, a subgroup of RM expressed interest in continuing the OCoP to focus on dissemination of research findings, further supporting the need for this community. Discussion/Significance of Impact: RM supported 11 research projects and contributed to the data collection for over 6,000 participants. Few opportunities exist to create an OCoP for large scale data collection on experiences with mentorship in STEMM.

The most efficient way to make them acquire these skills is to incorporate CT into K-12 education. To this end, various education programs have been designed to improve teachers’ and prospective teachers’ competence in CT. Such programs designing educational experiences based on teachers’ and prospective teachers’ preexisting opinions and self-efficacy perceptions about CT could achieve better results. Although the acquisition of CT skills has been suggested to start early on, these beliefs of early childhood teachers and prospective teachers have been underexplored. Therefore, this exploratory study aims to examine early childhood teachers’ and prospective teachers’ preconceptions and self-efficacy about CT. The study was conducted with 63 teachers and 78 prospective teachers in Turkey. Data were collected via an online survey in the spring of the 2020–2021 academic year. The preconceptions were assessed using a structured questionnaire, while the CT self-efficacy was measured with the Computational Thinking Scale. The findings showed similarities between teachers and prospective teachers in the preconceptions of CT. Both of them most strongly associated CT with logical thinking, problem-solving, using algorithms, coding/programming, doing mathematics, using technology in teaching, and using computers. Yet, teachers reported stronger associations between CT and logical thinking, using algorithms, and coding/programming.

33bd27ed73cfe81f09f2afc886da5832acab9d9f,The Lucy Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (L’LORRI),"NASA’s Lucy mission spacecraft was launched on 16 October 2021 and will perform the initial in situ investigation of the Jovian Trojan asteroids (Levison et al. 2021 , 2024 ). The Lucy LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (L’LORRI) is a panchromatic visible light (420–795 nm, 50% QE points), narrow-angle (field of view = 0.29°), high spatial resolution (1.0^′′ pixel^−1) imager used on the Lucy mission for both science observations and optical navigation. L’LORRI is designed to provide maps of the sunlit portions of the Trojan surfaces to a resolution of ∼10 m (after deconvolution), which will enable crater counting to constrain the surface ages. L’LORRI’s high sensitivity and large dynamic range permits imaging of the low albedo Trojans at moderately large phase angles (down to I/F values of ∼0.0014 with SNR ≈ 30 using an exposure time of 100 ms), as well as providing early acquisitions of the Trojans during the approach phase, searches for Trojan activity that are ∼10× better than can be obtained from Earth, and deep searches for potential Trojan satellites down to V ≈ 20.4 $V \approx 20.4$ at spatial resolutions far surpassing that available from Earth. This paper describes the L’LORRI instrument design and the requirements that drove the design. We present results from L’LORRI’s ground calibration campaign, summarize the L’LORRI in-flight calibration plan, and describe typical L’LORRI operations scenarios during the Trojan flybys. We also present an analysis of in-flight data taken during the first year of Lucy operations, which show that most aspects of L’LORRI’s performance are nominal (i.e., as predicted), but the telescope’s point spread function is slightly degraded relative to pre-flight predictions. Nevertheless, L’LORRI is still expected to fulfill all of its scientific objectives, which should revolutionize our view of the Jovian Trojans.",Space Science Reviews,2023.0,8,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11214-023-01028-z.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s11214-023-01028-z?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-023-01028-z, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There continue to be many individual and organizational challenges that must be overcome. The primary focus of researchers on teaching diminished their research skills—especially those needed towrite journal articles—as well as their knowledge of broad scholarly literature. This is coupled with the lack of knowledge of methodologies and a poor command of the English language. Compared to Western European countries, the teaching load is high and the wages of faculty members are low, which are important factors that discourage academics from engaging in more research activity. For example, in Poland, the average number of obligatory teaching hours for research-and-teaching faculty members that hold the position of professor is 180 class hours (i.e., six courses per academic year), whereas for non-professor researchand-teaching staff the average is 240 class hours (i.e., eight courses per academic year). The minimummonthly wage of full-professor academic faculty in Poland is €1,490 and in the Czech Republic, it is €3,337 (average pay); whereas in Germany, it is €6,000 EUR and higher (European Commission, Eurydice 2021). Overall, the important challenges for universities and researchers in CEE countries are to increase research output and to make their research more visible internationally. Institutional barriers, however, still remain, including a shortage of public funding for social science research (Kutsar and Kovács 2010), the limited ability of universities to offer grants, and professional training and research support for individual scholars. Universities—especially those enjoying the status of research institutions—are currently in the process of adopting new strategies that prioritize internationalization of research and channel funding. This will allow both earlycareer and senior scholars to develop their research skills, and we remain hopeful for these positive trends.▪",PS: Political Science & Politics,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/S1049096522000154?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096522000154, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e223cb4eb11bf676d7c71e2fe7a1cea310d52a23,'Only One Earth' – Celebrating soil science on World Environment Day 2022,"This Editorial introduces a EJSS Thematic Virtual Issue to highlight the importance of soils to celebrate World Environment Day 2022. The collection of papers selected by Dr Dan Evans is available here: https://bsssjournals. onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2389. world-environment-day Soils are one of the most significant components of terrestrial environments. They deliver an array of supporting, regulatory and provisioning roles across multiple spatial and temporal scales. It was therefore essential that soils—their diversity, their multifunctionality, and their complex and dynamic relationships with other ecosystems—were celebrated on annual World Environment Day, held this year on Sunday 5th June. Led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the theme of the 2022 World Environment Day was “Only One Earth”. It called for collective, transformative action on a global scale to celebrate, protect and restore our planet. Confronted with ongoing and, in some cases, accelerating rates of land degradation and soil erosion, this year’s theme was particularly relevant to soils. It acted as a reminder that, in human timeframes, soils are non-renewable, and that global efforts are needed to conserve them for future generations. #OnlyOneEarth This Thematic Virtual Issue of the European Journal of Soil Science serves to spotlight the importance of soil across a wide range of terrestrial environments, and to showcase the multifarious functions that soils play within these systems. The papers that have been curated for this Virtual Issue demonstrate that soil properties and processes are not only eclectic and often specialist across space and time, but that they are, to various degrees, sensitive to change, be it a short-term perturbation event (e.g. extreme weather episodes), or a longterm shift in the environment (e.g. climate change). Moreover, it will remain clear throughout reading the Virtual Issue that to bring about this “transformative action on a global scale to celebrate, protect, and restore our planet”, we must first advance our understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes in soils, how these govern soil functions, and how they react to, and interact, with environmental changes imposed upon them. The significance of soils at a continental scale, and how soil functions are modulated across contrasting climatic regimes and land management practices, is exemplified at the beginning of this Virtual Issue by Zwetsloot et al. (2021). This study represents one of the first to assess and monitor soil multifunctionality across Europe. Critically, whilst multifunctionality in soil can be achieved, the authors suggest that constraints and trade-offs do exist. In the spirit of World Environment Day, the paper serves as a fitting reminder that finding solutions to protect and restore all terrestrial ecosystems simultaneously may be overly optimistic, and that optimization polices may be more effective. Noted by Zwetsloot et al. (2021) as one of the functions delivered less frequently at high capacity across Europe, protecting and restoring biodiversity is critical across many environments, globally. Soil biodiversity in particular is often sacrificed for primary productivity and nutrient cycling, as demonstrated by Vazquez et al. (2021). Here, the authors show that a careful application of pesticides and fertilisers can address this trade-off and increase soil multifunctionality, a point which is also reiterated by Shi et al. (2020) in their field-based study of the impact of long-term fertilisation on soil fungal assemblies. Land management changes can therefore play a role in governing below-ground communities, alongside long-term climatic changes. However, as Shen et al. (2020) reveals, some soil biology can acclimatise. Under a long-term warming experiment in a steppe ecosystem, the authors found that soil heterotrophic respiration acclimated to long-term warming via modifying the constitution of cell membranes. Meanwhile, the impacts of changing climatic conditions on soil macrofauna are illustrated in Singh et al. (2021) who find that seasonality plays a seminal role in modulating the effects of future climate change. The need to advance our understanding of soil chemistry to better manage terrestrial environments is also highlighted here. Part of that advancement requires improved monitoring infrastructure, as showcased by Corwin (2021) who demonstrates how proximal sensors and remote imagery can be used to assess soil salinity on dryland agricultural soils.

 Varicocele, a condition of abnormally dilated veins within the pampiniform plexus, is associated with reduced male fertility in several species but its frequency and impact in rams is not well documented. Semen was collected and pampiniform plexus ultrasound performed in early December during breeding soundness examinations (BSE) of mature Composite-IV rams over a three-year study. A portion of rams were evaluated in multiple years and data from a total of 129 collections on 90 rams were available for analyses. Semen parameters were estimated by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Imaging software was used to quantify the cross-sectional area of five vessels per testis and average areas of the left testis (AAL), right testis (AAR), and both testes (AAT) were calculated. The correlation between AAL and AAR measured on the same ram within a year was moderate and positive (0.51; P < 0.001). However, correlations between AAL, AAR, and AAT measured on the same ram in consecutive years were not different from zero. Average vessel area was analyzed with fixed effects of testis side (AAL or AAR), year (2020, 2021, or 2022), ram age (2, 3, or ≥ 4 yr-old) and a random effect of ram. Across years, AAL was 23 to 25% greater than AAR and 16 to 18% greater in ≥ 4-yr-old than younger rams (P < 0.01). Unilateral varicocele (UV) was diagnosed when AAL/AAR or AAR/AAL ratio exceeded 1.5 in a ram and, for rams sampled in multiple years, those diagnosed in one year were considered affected for all subsequent years. Within year, prevalence of UV ranged from 16 to 36%. Scrotal circumference (SC) and CASA parameters were analyzed with fixed effects of year, ram age, and UV status and a random effect of ram. Within 2- and 3-yr-olds, sperm from UV rams had lower motility than unaffected rams (42.1 ± 6.7% vs 62.2 ± 4.1% and 47.8 ± 7.4% vs 70.1 ± 4.7%, respectively; P ≤ 0.02) but no differences were observed within 4-yr-old rams. Across ages, sperm from UV rams had a lower percentage of normal than unaffected rams (91.5 ± 1.1% vs 94.3 ± 0.74%; P = 0.03). Sperm concentration, progressive motility, and SC were unaffected by UV status. Future studies will evaluate the effect UV status on siring capacity. Ultrasound methodologies previously refined to diagnose varicocele in boars helped identify sub-fertile rams that would not have been classified by routine BSE procedures. However, these methodologies would benefit from concurrent machine learning and software development to ensure imaging consistency across technicians and streamline procedures for real-time decision making.

48204a2cf838df1aad6f3b9d44782fbe1533870c,A Systematic Literature Review of Deep Learning-Based Detection and Classification Methods for Bacterial Colonies,"— Deep learning is an area of machine learning that has substantial potential in various fields of study such as image processing and computer vision. A large number of studies are published annually on deep learning techniques. The focus of this paper is on bacteria detection, identification, and classification. This paper presents a systematic literature review that synthesizes the evidence related to bacteria colony identification and detection published in the year 2021. The aim is to aggregate, analyse, and summarize the evidence related to deep learning detection, identification, and classification of bacteria and bacteria colonies. The significance is that the review will help experts and technicians to understand how deep learning techniques can apply in this regard and potentially further support more accurate detection of bacteria types. A total of 38 studies are analysed. The majority of the published studies focus on supervised-learning– based convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, a large number of studies make use of laboratory-prepared datasets as compared to open-source and industrial datasets.

Searches were conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus. The time frame for the analysis was from the start of the pandemic until 9th December 2021. A total of 322 papers were found. The number of articles assessed for eligibility was 32, and after applying the exclusion criteria, 13 papers were included in the qualitative synthesis. Most of the studies analysed only direct costs (69.23%) and were focused on Asia (61.54%), where the larger indirect costs, as well as the greater total costs, were found. However, the higher costs per patient and year were shown for the United States. This investigation showed the importance of COVID-19 in national, regional and local budgets.

The present study provides an update on the distribution of Dermacentor ticks in Germany, using a citizen science approach. Ticks were collected by citizens from March 2020 to May 2021, and submitted along with information on the date and location of collection, potential hosts and details about the circumstances of discovery. In total, 3,292 Dermacentor specimens were received, of which 76.4% (2,515/3,292) were identified as D. reticulatus and 23.0% (758/3,292) as D. marginatus, while 0.6% (19/3,292) were too damaged for species-level identification. Dermacentor reticulatus was received from all federal states of Germany. Maxent species distribution models predicted suitable environmental conditions for D. reticulatus throughout Germany. Findings on the vegetation or on pastured animals without travel history confirmed the occurrence of this tick species as far north as the most northern German federal state Schleswig-Holstein. In contrast, the distribution of D. marginatus still appears to be limited to southwestern Germany, although the northward shift of the distribution limit observed in the preceding citizen science study, as compared with previous published distributions, was confirmed. This shift was also predicted by Maxent species distribution models, reflecting the broader distribution of the tick occurrence data contributed by citizens. Most D. reticulatus ticks were found on dogs (1,311/1,960, 66.9%), while D. marginatus was mainly discovered on hoofed animals (197/621, 31.7%) and humans (182/621, 29.3%). Human tick bites were reported in 0.7% (14/1,960) of host-assigned D. reticulatus and 3.4% (21/621) of host-assigned D. marginatus. Further studies to investigate an increasing endemisation of Babesia canis in Germany as well as the relevance of D. reticulatus for TBEV spread throughout the country, e.g., by traveling dogs, are urgently needed. In view of the activity of D. reticulatus during winter or the colder months, which complements that of Ixodes ricinus, a year-round tick protection of at least dogs is strongly recommended.",Frontiers in Veterinary Science,2022.0,22,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.1044597/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9666490, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases until March 2021 to compare the prognosis of early-stage cervical cancer patients who underwent MIS (laparoscopic or robot-assisted radical hysterectomy) or ARH. The primary outcomes included rates of 3- and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO: CRD42021258116. Results This meta-analysis included 48 studies involving 23346 patients (11220, MIS group; 12126, ARH group). The MIS group had a poorer medium-term (3-year) DFS (HR=1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.16, p=0.031) than the ARH group, without significant difference in medium-term OS as well as long-term (5-year) DFS and OS. Subgroup analysis of 3-year prognosis revealed that although patients in Western countries who underwent MIS had shorter DFS than those who underwent ARH (HR=1.10, p=0.024), no difference was observed in DFS among those in Asian countries. Moreover, MIS was linked to poorer 3-year DFS in patients with stage I cervical cancer (HR=1.07, p=0.020). Notably, subgroup analysis of 5-year prognosis revealed that patients with tumor size ≥2 cm undergoing MIS exhibited a shorter DFS than those who underwent ARH (HR=1.65, p=0.041). Conclusion Patients with early-stage cervical cancer undergoing MIS may have a poorer prognosis than those undergoing ARH. Therefore, applying MIS in early-stage cervical cancer patients should be conducted with caution.

Forecasting is an art and science in predicting future events. The Regional Financial and Asset Management Agency (BPKAD) of Asahan Regency does not yet know the Regional Revenue in the upcoming period & is not yet available a system that can calculate Regional Revenue for the upcoming period. The main purpose of this research is to know the prediction of Regional Income in the following year. The system created helps in determining Regional Revenue in 2022, with data used from 2011 – 2021. The Trend Moment method is a method that uses certain statistical and mathematical calculation methods to find out the function of a straight line instead of a broken line formed by the company's historical data. In choosing the forecast method, accuracy is needed to minimize errors in forecasting (forecast error), the goal is that the forecast can approach reality. Based on the results of system testing, this Regional Revenue Forecasting predicts regional revenue in 2022, which is IDR 136,847,395,228.82 and the result of the percentage of errors (MAPE) Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 0.12%.","Building of Informatics, Technology and Science (BITS)",2022.0,5,"{'url': 'https://ejurnal.seminar-id.com/index.php/bits/article/download/2090/1371', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47065/bits.v4i2.2090?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47065/bits.v4i2.2090, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, a scientometric analysis focusing on tDCS after stroke is still missing. The purpose of this study is to deliver a bibliometric analysis to investigate the global hotspots and frontiers in the domain of tDCS in stroke from 2012 to 2021. Methods: Articles and reviews related to tDCS in stroke were retrieved and obtained from the Web of Science core collection database from 2012 to 2021. Data visualization and analysis were conducted by using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel 2019. Results: Finally, 371 publications were included in the scientometric analysis, including 288 articles and 83 reviews. The results showed that the number of publications per year increased from 15 to 68 in the last 10 years. Neurosciences was the main research hotspot category (n = 201). Frontiers in Human Neuroscience was the most published journal with 14 papers. The most productive author, institution, and country were Fregni F (n = 13), the League of European Research Universities (n = 37), and the United States of America (n = 98), respectively. A burstness analysis of keywords and the literature indicated that current studies in the field of tDCS in stroke focused on poststroke aphasia, tDCS combined with robotic therapy, and anatomical parameters. Conclusion: The research of tDCS in stroke is predicted to remain a research hotspot in the future. We recommend investigating the curative effect of other different tDCS closed-loop rehabilitation methods for different stroke dysfunctions. In conclusion, this bibliometric study presented the hotspots and trends of tDCS in stroke over the last decade, which may help researchers manage their further studies.",Brain Science,2022.0,5,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/13/1/15/pdf?version=1672997448', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9856087, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aimed to analyze major contributors and trends in IA-related animal research using bibliometric analysis. Methods IA-related animal studies were retrieved from the Web of Science database. Microsoft Excel 2010, GraphPad Prism 6, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace were used to collect and analyze the characteristics of this field. Results A total of 273 publications were retrieved. All publications were published between 1976 and 2021, and the peak publication year is 2019. Rat model were used in most of the publications, followed by mice and rabbits. Japan (35.5%), the United States (30.0%), and China (20.1%) were the top three most prolific countries. Although China ranks third in the number of publications, it still lacks high-quality articles and influential institutions. Stroke was the most prolific journal that accepted publications related to IA research using animal models. Circulation has the highest impact factor with IA-related animal studies. Hashimoto N contributed the largest number of articles. Meng hui journal published the first and second highest cited publications. The keywords “subarachnoid hemorrhage,” “macrophage,” “rupture,” “mice,” “elastase,” “gene,” “protein,” “proliferation,” and “risk factors” might be a new trend for studying IA-related animal research. Conclusions Japan and the Unites States contributed the most to IA–related animal studies, in terms of both researchers and institutions. Although China ranks third in terms of the number of publications, it should strengthen the quality of its publications. Researchers should pay attention to the latest progress of Stroke, Journal of Neurosurgery, Neurosurgery, and Circulation for their high-quality IA-related animal studies.

Pediatricians and child psychiatrists can play a central role in identifying threatened children. We reviewed experiences of DV screening in pediatric and child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to understand its feasibility and provide clues for its implementation. We performed bibliographic research using the Sapienza Library System, PubMed, and the following databases: MEDLINE, American Psychological Association PsycArticles, American Psychological Association PsycInfo, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. We considered a 20-year interval when selecting the articles and we included studies published in English between January 2000 and March 2021. A total of 23 out of 2335 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. We found that the prevalence of disclosed DV ranged from 4.2% to 48%, with most prevalence estimates between 10% and 20%. Disclosure increases with a detection plan, which is mostly welcomed by mothers (70–80% acceptance rates). Written tools were used in 55% of studies, oral interviews in 40%, and computer instruments in 20%. Mixed forms were used in three studies (15%). The most used and effective tool appeared to be the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) (30% of studies). For young children, parental reports are advisable and written instruments are the first preference; interviews can be conducted with older children. Our research pointed out that the current literature does not provide practical clinical clues on facilitating the disclosure in pediatric clinics and CAMHS.

ccf08d2989200b8de481221109c26b8879534218,Bioethanol Producing from Sorghum Crops,"The relevance of the article lies in a comprehensive analysis of the trend in the production of biofuels from crop products in Ukraine and other countries of the world. The purpose of the research was to justify on the basis of research by both their own and many authors that sorghum varieties are extremely important in cultivation due to changes in soil and climatic conditions. When conducting research, we used generally accepted methods, techniques and DSTU, in particular: the method of comparison, analysis and synthesis, laboratory and field. Computer methods of information processing and visualization of research results using the Microsoft Office program were also used. According to the results of research, it was found that with less favorable temperature conditions and moisture supply in 2020 yr., grain sorghum crops formed a yield depending on the hybrid in the range of 2.1-6.9 t/ha, in a more favorable year for these indicators in 2021 yr. it was at the level of 6.9-14.5 t/ha, and on average for two years it was in the range of 4.5-10.7 t/ha. Performance stability was determined in the U 60117 IG and Bianca hybrids. On average, over two years, the theoretical yield of biofuels, depending on the hybrid, ranged from 2216 up to 5199 l/ha with a starch content in the grain of more than 75%. The highest estimated alcohol yield per unit area was in the grain sorghum hybrid U 60116 IG, which combines a stable yield (10.7 t/ha) with a high starch content in the grain (75%). Treatment of sugar sorghum crops with biologics and microfertilizers had a positive effect on the yield of structural units per hectare: compared to the control, the yield of leaves during organic balance processing increased by 2.66 t/ha, the yield of panicles – by 1.56 t/ha, and stems – by 3.64 t/ha. The increase in the conditional yield of sugars relative to the control of treatment with Quantum microfertilizers was 0.354 t/ha, organic balance – 0.417 t/ha, and with their combined action – 1.143 t/ha, which was the maximum value",UKRAINIAN BLACK SEA REGION AGRARIAN SCIENCE,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.56407/2313-092x/2022-26(1)-1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.56407/2313-092x/2022-26(1)-1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f6f1aec72ac68ea0561da488998f541c3e586792,Abstract LB-164: Transdisciplinary research in energetics and cancer (TREC) early career investigator training program: First year results,"Purpose: Obesity, poor diet and physical inactivity increase the burden of cancer by increasing risk of incident cancer, mortality, and long term adverse treatment effects. It is critical that scientists receive training in conducting rigorous and impactful energy balance and cancer research. To address this need, we developed an annual one-week, in residence NCI-R25-funded Transdisciplinary Research in Energetics and Cancer (TREC) Training Course for early career investigators in basic, clinical and population sciences. This analysis examined the impact of the TREC Training Program on course satisfaction, knowledge gained, publications and awards among TREC Year 1 program participants (i.e., TREC Fellows). Methods: The TREC program consists of two components: an intensive, in-person, one-week Course, followed by a one-year TREC mentorship program. TREC Faculty are comprised of a TD team of ~20 international expert faculty members. TREC Faculty and Fellows completed surveys before and immediately after the course. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used to determine course-related changes in knowledge and skills. At the end of the one-year mentorship period, a survey was sent inquiring about TREC-related research productivity and collaborations. Number of publications and grant-funding between June 2017 and December 2018 was compiled and summarized for the 20 TREC Fellows participating in the inaugural TREC course. Results: Information about the program was shared with ~30 organizations, resulting in 77 applications for the inaugural course. Twenty TREC Fellows completed the program, including three basic, seven clinical, and 10 population scientists. Sixteen of the TREC fellows were junior faculty and four were postdoctoral fellows. The 5-day course included over 50 lectures, small-group breakouts and Faculty-Fellow sessions. Attendees rated the course as very high, with an average 96.7% of responses scoring in the top two categories of “good” or “very good”. Knowledge related to conducting energy balance and cancer research significantly improved in 37 out of 39 competencies (94.8%). Between the end of the TREC Year 1 program in June 2017 and December 2018, TREC Year 1 Fellows published 20 manuscripts, with 15 co-authored with other TREC Fellows and/or Faculty. Fifteen % of manuscripts were published in journals with an impact factor > 10. A total of 19 grant applications were funded to TREC Fellows (i.e., five NIH awards, three ACS awards, three foundation awards, and eight internal pilot awards). Seven TREC Fellows were appointed or promoted in academic positions. Conclusion: The overall impact of the TREC Program will be defined by the degree to which TREC Fellows produce innovative research approaches and discoveries that could improve the health of populations at risk for cancer as well as cancer survivors. Upon completion of the 5th year of the TREC Training Program in 2021, we will disseminate the TREC Training Program material for adoption by the broader research and clinical community.

7ef2ee552df3196cd52ef2226e29741e04c71fa6,Beyond the Ballot Box: A Conversation About Democracy and Policing in the United States,"Political scientist Hakeem Jefferson (Stanford University) facilitated a discussion about race, policing, and the state of American democracy with fellow political scientists Cathy J. Cohen (University of Chicago), Yanilda M. González (Harvard Kennedy School), Rebecca U. Thorpe (University of Washington), and Vesla M. Weaver (Johns Hopkins University) on May 26, 2021. The conversation occurred a year after George Perry Floyd Jr., a 46-year-old Black man, was murdered by a White police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Moving beyond common notions of democracy that focus primarily on voting and electoral participation, the panelists discussed how American policing and the criminal justice system, more broadly, redefine citizenship, redistribute power, and shape marginalized people's understanding of their place in society. Closing remarks addressed the potential for change in how criminal justice institutions treat marginalized people and how political scientists can more usefully contribute to efforts that strengthen democracy for all.

Aim: The study aimed to assess the QoL post-Diverted Mini Gastric Bypass (dMGB), focusing on weight loss achieved, comorbidity resolution, and change in QoL after the surgery. Setting: Single private institute, India 
Methods : Data from patients who underwent a laparoscopic primary dMGB from August 2020 to August 2021 by one surgeon were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were followed up at 3,6,9, and 12 months from the surgery date. Data were assessed using the Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System- II (BAROS- II) form based on three major areas: percentage weight loss, comorbidity resolution, and QoL. The variation in QoL was assessed using the Moorehead Ardelt QoL questionnaire, which addresses self-esteem, physical activity, social gathering, and sexual life. 
Results: Forty-one patients were included in the final analysis. The average age and pre-operative body mass index (BMI) was 45.5 yrs. and 44.5 kg/m2, respectively. The cohort had 60.9% of males and 39.1% females. The pre-operative average total QoL score was 0.65 ± 0.2. At 12 months, the average BMI and average total QoL were 28.03 kg/m2 and 5.35 ± 0.3, respectively, p<0.001.

To evaluate the economic performance of propyrisulfuron, a field study was conducted in 2021 and 2022 on a farm of the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China. Eight different herbicide treatments were employed, including CB (cyhalofop butyl), Py (propyrisulfuron), CBPy (cyhalofop butyl plus propyrisulfuron), PrBe 3, PrBe 10, and PrBe 3+PrBe 10 (pretilachlor plus bensulfuron applied at different times [at 3 (PrBe 3) and 10 (PrBe 10) d] or sequentially, respectively), 2PrBe+PeCBBz (pretilachlor plus bensulfuron [applied sequentially] followed by penoxsulam plus cyhalofop butyl plus bentazone), 2PrBe+MeCBBz (pretilachlor plus bensulfuron [applied sequentially] followed by metamifop plus cyhalofop butyl plus bentazone), along with weed-free and nontreated weedy check treatments. Herbicide treatments did not cause visual phytotoxicity to rice, and bending and leaf rolling were not observed. Only the two propyrisulfuron treatments had temporary negative effects on rice height, but rice recovered quickly. Compared with the weed-free treatment, CBPy did not affect rice tiller number or dry matter accumulation. Compared with the nontreated weedy check, herbicide treatments reduced total weed density by 29.4% to 99.1% and dry biomass by 32.2% to 98.7%. The CBPy treatment provided the best weed control, reducing weed density and biomass by 96.7% and 95.9% in 2021 and 97.4% and 95.6% in 2022, respectively. Rice grain yield was not significantly different between CBPy and the weed-free treatment in either year. Economic analysis showed that CBPy provided the highest net profit, followed by that in 2PrBe+PeCBBz and 2PrBe+MeCBBz, with the lowest net profit in the nontreated weedy check. Thus, CBPy provides good weed control and could be promoted in mechanically transplanted rice fields in China.",Frontiers in Plant Science,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1281931/pdf?isPublishedV2=False', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10619164, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

38dd699326deb6205a8f229b9c4246d15936eb0c,Zooming in on Open Access in Ukraine,"In October 2022, Ukraine declared its commitment to enhancing the effectiveness, quality and responsiveness of its research by implementing the National Plan for Open Science (Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, 2022). This document represents a significant step forward in aligning Ukraine's national legislation with European Union requirements and promoting the adoption of open science practices. Open access (OA) is a crucial component of open science, and it is imperative to gain insight into its growth to inform funding policies and plan infrastructure development accordingly.The aim of this research is to obtain a comprehensive overview of the OA development in Ukraine. To achieve this goal, publications affiliated with Ukrainian research institutions and universities in the period from 2012 to 2021 were collected from three well-known databases: Dimensions, Web of Science, and Scopus. Records were gathered in November 2022 using the web interfaces of WoS and Scopus, while data from Dimensions was extracted via the Dimensions API. After excluding duplicates and publications without DOIs, the OA status of each publication was determined using the Unpaywall API.
The study revealed that between 2012 and 2021, authors affiliated with Ukrainian research institutions and universities published 201,670 research papers. Of these publications, 66.7% were open access, while the remaining 33.3% were behind a paywall. The percentage of OA articles for the indicated 10-year period increased substantially from 33.8% in 2012 to 79.9% in 2021.Gold open access was the most common OA subtype, with 68.4% of articles published in OA journals. The second most frequent choice was bronze open access, accounting for 15.3% of articles. Green subtype and hybrid were less commonly used, with 8.5% and 7.8% of articles published in these categories, respectively.Regarding the distribution of open access across different academic disciplines, the highest percentage of OA publications was found in the social sciences, with a rate of 88.1%, followed closely by the humanities at 87.8%, and medical and health sciences at 73.4%. Agriculture sciences, multidisciplinary studies, and natural sciences also exhibited relatively high levels of OA publications, representing 71.7%, 63.4%, and 55.7%, respectively. The lowest proportion of OA publications was observed in the engineering and technology category, with a rate of 47.7%.This empirical study indicates that the share of OA publications in Ukraine is significantly higher than the global average of 31% reported by Piwowar, Priem, and Orr in 2019 and their estimation of 44% by 2025 (Piwowar et al., 2019). Notably, Ukraine is approaching the indicators of European ""openness"" leaders, such as Great Britain, Sweden, Austria, and the Netherlands (Robinson-Garcia et al., 2020). It is worth mentioning that northern and central European countries have been early adopters of open access policies (Maddi et al., 2021), while Ukraine lacks mandates for research dissemination through OA, transformative agreements and only a few institutions have registered their OA policy with ROARMAP. The high share of OA publications in Ukraine can be partially attributed to the longstanding tradition of national journals being open access and fully subsidized by hosting research institutions. Therefore, open access has always been a part of the research dissemination culture in Ukraine (Novikov, 2020).",PUBMET - Conference Scholarly Publishing Context Open Science,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://morepress.unizd.hr/journals/index.php/pubmet/article/download/4255/4987', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15291/pubmet.4255?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15291/pubmet.4255, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The study aimed to examine if fertigation with nitrogen applied at a standard rate results in the best cucumber yield in two greenhouses with different soil nutrient levels, i.e. optimal and high. We investigated the nitrogen (N) uptake pattern of cucumbers with the different nitrogen supply levels which included half the standard rate (N0.5), the standard rate (N1) and double the standard rate (N2). In year 2020, the N1 amendment resulted in highest yield in the soil with optimal nutrient level, however, lower N0.5 resulted in higher yield in the high-nutrient soil. In year 2021, there was no statistical difference in the yield by different nitrogen supply levels in both soils with optimal and high nutrient level. Soil NO3-N remained low in the low nutrient soil regardless of the amount of N supplied, but soil NO3-N was high in the high nutrient soil supplied with N2. The Partial Factor Productivity of Nitrogen (PFPN) was highest in the N0.5 and it decreased as N supply increased in the optimal and high nutrient soil. In conclusion, a precise fertigation schedule is needed to be set with the consideration of the soil nutrient status.",Korean Journal of Soil Science and Fertilizer,2022.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.kjssf.org/articles/pdf/d2zA/ksssf-2022-055-01-4.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.7745/kjssf.2022.55.1.027?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.7745/kjssf.2022.55.1.027, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a000b392ff1e8fb0bd910503e081297aacd4bd03,Workshops Without Borders: Building an Online Community of Japan Scholars,"DOI:10.1017/S1049096522000270 In June 2020, the Project on Middle East Political Science (POMEPS) launched a virtual research workshop for junior scholars to fill the void left by the cancelation of so many conferences and workshops due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 2021–2022 academic year, we expanded the virtual workshop dramatically to include 18 workshops dedicated to book manuscripts or journal-article manuscripts. Because of the format’s flexibility, efficiency, and advantages for diversity and inclusion, we plan to continue it even when travel becomes possible again. There are costs and risks, however, that require attention. Overall, the move to virtual research workshops has been a resounding success. Since its launch, POMEPS has conducted 24 workshops, including 82 junior-scholar authors and 58 seniorscholar discussants. Each two-hour article workshop typically features three papers, each with one assigned discussant. The authors are asked to read the other two papers, whereas discussants may but are not required to do so. As the convener and moderator, I read all of the papers and provide a second set of comments to supplement the assigned discussant. Book workshops, which are more intense, typically last 90 minutes for one paper or three hours for two papers on related themes. Each book manuscript has two dedicated readers, in addition to myself and typically one other member of the selection committee. We conducted 11 virtual bookworkshops for the 2021–2022 academic year. The buy-in from theMiddle East political science (and broader Middle East studies) community has been phenomenal. Although we cannot offer honoraria, almost all invited discussants usually agree to participate. If they are unavailable, they often offer suggestions for alternatives—which is useful when the topics of the papers or books are outside of the organizers’ areas of expertise. A Zoom meeting will never be as much fun as an in-person seminar, but the relatively small size of the group keeps everyone engaged and allows for personal interactions. Authors do not present their manuscript, assuming that it has been read in advance, which maintains a high level of engagement because there are few long spans of only listening. The virtual format allows us to more fully include scholars based in theMiddle East and Europe, for whom it otherwisemight be prohibitively expensive and pose complicated visa issues. We can offer invitations without regard to physical distance or national location. As a result, scholars from the Middle East and Europe who otherwise might have been excluded for logistical or cost reasons can participate at a high level: 40 of the 82 article authors and eight of the 11 book authors participated from outside of the United States. This also allows us to forego extensive advance planning, travel arrangements and logistics, andmultiday disruptions. The selection process actively seeks applicants from outside of the usual elite institutional networks, on the assumption that junior scholars from top schools already have support from their institution and are networked into the scholarly community. POMEPS has definite plans to continue these workshops even after the world heals; however, there are disadvantages to the format. In general, we have not heard the common complaint that online sessions are alienating, non-interactive, or unproductive. The small size and engagement-oriented organization has resulted in dynamic and productive sessions. Zoom burnout is real, however. We have found that a session lasting more than a few hours is difficult to sustain, even for the most dedicated of us. Time zones also have been an issue—we sometimes struggle to find workable times for participants who might be calling in from the West Coast of the United States and from Doha, Qatar. Moreover, there is no substitute for the informal time after inperson workshops sharing cocktails or dinner or an evening walk through a new city. We are concerned that the ease of virtual workshops will lead to a two-tier system in which non-U.S. based scholars benefit from feedback and professional development but remain excluded from the more informal social benefits of inperson events. A more significant concern about the potential for a selfdestructive dynamic is the tendency to overschedule because it is so easy and inexpensive to do so. The sheer volume of workshops enabled by the virtual format can be overwhelming, not only for the organizer who reads and comments on all of the papers almost weekly but also for the larger community. If we exhaust the pool of plausible readers and return multiple times to the same senior scholars, at some point, their enthusiasm for being a discussant inevitably will wane. Furthermore, it is possible that funders will observe the success of online models and become unwilling to fund the more expensive and unwieldy in-person events. That would be very disappointing because many new ideas and enduring partnerships are developed in those informal spaces of inperson conferences and workshops.▪",PS: Political Science & Politics,2022.0,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/S1049096522000282?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096522000282, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To gain an understanding of the nuances of this concept, it is enough to delve into just one topic of elementary school mathematics curriculum. Select an arbitrarily unit segment, build two segments with lengths of ordinary fractions with different denominators and make sure that it is impossible to compare them in length in numerical terms. Then, appreciate the remarkable ability of Mathematics, to provide a solution to what would otherwise appear to be an insoluble problem. 

In the educational process, it is essential to differentiate between the state and the student. The first provides the opportunity to obtain knowledge, but is not to answer for the second. However, there must be moral and material motivation to obtain high-quality knowledge. In his teachings, wise Abay cautioned that the word from the educated though demanding, can illuminate the path to understanding. He urged to perceive the light and mystery that surrounds us. With his words ""Aitshy-aytshyp zhalynar, Uqqysh zhansyp shabynar. Uqpay zhatyp zhalyǵar, uıqyly-oıaý boıkúıez"", which translates as ‘mindless boredom, drowsiness’, he emphasised the importance of remaining alert and awake to the world around us. In the absence of boredom, sleepiness"", as in the case of personal transformation of the individual and the principle of ""you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink"". 

The concept of ""Justice"" is a multifaceted topic in the International Educational Space. It is the universal division between ""Global North"" and the ""Global South"", where the former has a stronger economy, infrastructure and technology, while the latter is characterized by less diverse economy, by poverty and inequality and a history of colonization by the countries of the Global North. These studies adopt from various points of views: sociological, economic, pedagogical, legal and political, as well as various professional approaches such as ""Fair education from the standpoint of textbook quality"" or ""Development and implementation of programs that take into account the needs of different groups of students"", ""Evaluation of the effectiveness of pedagogical strategies aimed at eliminating educational inequality"", and ""The role of technology in providing access to education"", etc.

classifying skin lesions compared with dermatologists which is lifesaving in terms of diagnosing. This will
help people diagnosetheir cancer on their own by just installing app on mobile devices. It is estimated that 6.3
billion people will use the subscriptions by the end of year 2021[28] for diagnosing their skin cancer.
Objective: This study represents review of many research articles on classifying skin lesions using CNNs.
With the recent enhancement in machine learning algorithms, misclassification rate of skin lesions has
reduced compared to a dermatologist classifying them.In this article we discuss how using CNNs has evolved
in successfully classifying skin cancer type, and methods implemented, and the success rate. Even though
Deep learning using CNN has advantages compared to a dermatologist, it also has some vulnerabilities, in
terms of misclassifying images under some Criteria, and situations. We also discuss about those
Vulnerabilities in this review study.
Methods: We searched theScienceDirect, PubMed,Elsevier, Web of Science databases and Google Scholar
for original research articles that are published. We selected papers that have sufficient data and information
regarding their research, and we created a review on their approaches and methods they have used. From
the articles we searched online So far no review paper has discussed both opportunities and vulnerabilities

c7c446b83ca5b903f1d8b70e9fc8bdeb2e5a6bdb,Training Teaching Assistants by Offering an Introductory Course,"Teaching assistants (TAs) are often used in computer science (CS) courses to conduct tutorials in smaller groups and to be able to provide students with one-to-one help sessions. TAs can also assist with the assessment, which can be time-consuming in large classes. Previous research does, however, indicate that TAs can be poorly prepared for their work tasks. In this experience report, we present a TA training course that addresses this issue and prepares new TAs for their responsibilities. This includes conducting tutorials, tutoring and providing students with useful feedback in lab settings, and conducting assessments. In addition, we also aimed at creating a safe space for our TAs to discuss challenges and fears that they foresee or have already experienced as TAs. To do this, we developed an introductory course consisting of five modules, that are based on previous research on TAs in CS and in the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework. The modules are: HR questions, classroom teaching, helping and supervising in lab sessions, assessment, and reflection and discussion.

When medical education is given in its ""normal"" course, primarily macroscopic anatomy education and other basic medical sciences form the foundation, and then the clinical medical sciences are built on top of this foundation. Due to its importance, as mentioned above, it is known to be a course feared by students newly starting their medical education. A literature search showed that there was not an ""Anatomy Attitude Scale"" that questions the views of medical school students in our country about anatomy. This study aims to develop a scale to reveal the attitudes of medical school students towards anatomy validly and reliably and to investigate anatomy attitudes of medical school students using this scale in a pilot administration. This study included 700 Term 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 students studying in the School of Medicine of Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University (ÇOMU) in the academic year 2020-2021 who agreed to take part in the study. Of these students, 345 were recruited for factor analysis and 355 for investigation of attitudes. In the study, an Anatomy Attitude Scale was developed first in line with the literature, which consisted of 14 items and 3 subfactors, ""Value of Anatomy"", ""Hating Anatomy"", and ""Time Allocated to Anatomy"". The results of construct validity were also verified by confirmatory factor analysis. Then, the scale was administered to 355 students. The results obtained from the data showed that the students of ÇOMU Medical School were aware of the importance of anatomy as a fundamental medical science, and the physician candidates who intended to become a specialist in any branch in the future attributed more value to Anatomy.

24a250f2055a4fcaaac2402574c317be27c5f523,Ecology for Sustainable Development in the Anthropocene,"The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) call for celebrating the year 2022 as the 'International Year of Basic Sciences for Sustainable Development’ (IYBSSD) is an ambitious move and a golden year in the history of science itself, as IYBSSD is aimed at putting a spotlight on the interdependencies and intricacies between basic sciences and the Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) so that political leaders, policymakers, and even the general public at large will realize the prime significance of basic sciences for global sustainability (Triendl 2000; Griggs et al. 2013; Editorial 2021). While this momentum for global awakening and solidarity brings reason to rejoice, it also warrants retrospection. Exploring the unseen potentialities of basic sciences for furthering the transition towards a healthy planet is indeed a welcome move so that humanity can live in harmony with nature while averting the negative impacts of anthropogenic activities (Dalton 2002) and maximizing the socioeconomic and biocultural benefits for a good quality of life and human wellbeing. It will also help us to learn new norms in the wake of pandemics like COVID-19 (Lin et al. 2021). However, it is also a matter of retrospection that even with the exponential advancement in science and technology (thanks to modern technology, we are now venturing into outer space and planets), human curiosity and ingenuity failed to understand the resilience and carrying capacity of our own planet and how the ongoing alterations in nature and natural processes are going to affect our own survival. As echoed by scientists across the globe (Seitzinger 2010; Griggs et al. 2013; Foley 2017), planet Earth is at a crossroads and our actions during this decade will determine the future of the rest of the species. Hence, it is the prime time to harness the immense potential of basic sciences like ecology for sustainable development. While technology can offer solutions to most of the challenges (Triendl 2000; Dalton 2002; Editorial 2021), technological advancements alone are not enough to solve all of the ecological and environmental crises we are facing today. Positive attitudes and behavioural changes are more important than ever in order to effectively use the power of sustainable technologies to address ongoing planetary crises (Priyadarshini et al. 2022). Hence, repositioning the basic sciences as a better and more effective means of advancing sustainable development is critical for reducing our carbon footprint while resetting a more respectful and sensitive relationship with nature (Seitzinger 2010; Editorial 2021).The present editorial briefly outlines the significance of ecology for facilitating the transitions towards a greener, cleaner, and more resilient planet and its unexplored potential for reconnecting and reinforcing humans' relationship with nature in the Anthropocene. Ecology, the ""study of the relationships between living organisms, including humans, and their physical environment"" (http:// www. esa. org), wrought by the legacies of the pioneer ecologists during the last few centuries, is believed to be a comparatively new discipline (http:// www. oxfor dbibl iogra phies. com). For a modern biology student, the origin of ‘Ecology’ as a systematic and scientific discipline can be traced back to the monumental works of Carl Linnaeus, Alexander von Humboldt, and many others, whereas for a science historian, the origin can even be linked to the classical botanical works of Theophrastus in 348 BC (http:// www. brita nnica. com). However, Ecology is one of the oldest scientific disciplines, as old as humanity and gradually evolving with human civilization. Humanity thrived on this planet primarily because of their ecological knowledge (Odum 1977; Kormondy 2012) and their intricate associations with nature, which started during the cave-dwelling period onwards. Even before the origin of Homo sapiens, early hominids might have had thorough ecological knowledge regarding their surrounding environment: knowledge about the best time to hunt, to distinguish edible and nonedible commodities, to recognize the medicinal and curative properties of plants, the seasonal responses of plants and * Purushothaman Chirakkuzhyil Abhilash pca.iesd@bhu.ac.in",Anthropocene Science,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s44177-022-00035-z.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9396579, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The corn crop, the Micado hybrid, was organized within the Didactic and Experimental Station of the ""King Mihai I"" University of Life Sciences in Timisoara, under the specific conditions of the 2021-2022 agricultural year. The soil in the crop plot was of chernozem type, and the crop was in a non-irrigated system. To obtain the satellite data, the Sentinel 2 system was used. To characterize the plot and the crop of silage corn, 14 sets of images were taken, in the interval March - July 2022. From the analysis of the images, the spectral data were obtained, and based on the consecrated formulas MSAVI, NDMI, NDVI and NBR indexes were calculated. The ANOVA test confirmed the reliability of the data and the presence of variance in the data set (F>Fcrit, p<0.001, for Alpha=0.001). The level of correlations identified between the calculated indices was between r=0.967 (NBR with NDVI) and r=0.996 (NDVI with MSAVI). The variation of the NBR index, in relation to the other indices, was described by linear equations, in terms of statistical safety (R2=0.965, p<0.001, in relation to MSAVI; R2=0.989, p<0.001 in relation to NDMI; R2=0.934, p<0.001 in relation to NDVI). The variation of indices in relation to time (t, days) during the study period was described by polynomial equations of the 3rd degree, in terms of statistical safety (R2=0.964 for MSAVI, R2=0.934 for NDMI, R2=0.941 for NDVI, and R2=0.961 for NBR). Regression analysis facilitated obtaining some equations, as models for predicting biomass production, under conditions of statistical safety. Based on the RMSEP parameter, it was found that the most reliable level of production prediction was obtained in the case of MSAVI and NDMI indices (RMSEP=0.05923).

It is well known that psychological distress during times of uncertainty and sedentary behaviors may lead to adverse health outcomes such as morbidity and mortality. Physical activity (PA) has been shown to positively mediate distress and other mental health outcomes. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine college students’ perceived stress levels and PA behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and remote learning. METHODS: An Institutional Review Board approved online Qualtrics survey was used to collect data from eighty-four enrolled college students (mean age 24.4±5.79 years, 57.6% female) in Spring 2021, in Southern California (83.5% public four-year institution, 14.1% other). A 48-item Perceived Stress Inventory (PSI, categories: financial, family, academic, time management, and social stressors) scale using a 10-point Likert scale (1 = no stress and 10 = high stress), along with the Major Life Events Scale (MLES) assessing distressful life experiences, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), reporting PA behaviors from the last seven days were included. PSI, MLES, and IPAQ-SF responses were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v27. A Spearman Rank Order Correlation was used to assess the relationships with a p-value <0.05 for significance. RESULTS: Time management stress was significantly and negatively correlated ( rho = -0.336, p = 0.004) to the total minutes spent sitting, based on IPAQ-SF data. Also, several PSI scores (various categories) trended toward significance with PA behaviors amongst the participants.

The core-topic is the medicinal plant heritage of the Ghirardi Botanic Garden (Toscolano Maderno, Brescia, Italy) of the University of Milan. In this work, we studied Myrtus communis L. subsp. communis (Myrtaceae) at multiple scale levels: macro- and micromorphological, with special emphasis on the secretory structures responsible for the production of secondary metabolites; phytochemical, with the analysis of the essential oil (EO) composition from leaves (fresh, dried, stored at −20 °C and at −80 °C) and fruits over two consecutive years (2018 and 2019); bio-ecological, with a focus, based on literature data, on the ecology and biological activity of the main EO components. The occurrence of secretory cavities producing terpenes, along with flavonoids, was proven. A high level of chemical variability across the obtained EO profiles emerged, especially that concerning quantitative data. However, regardless of the different conservation procedures, the examined plant part, or the phenological stage, we detected the presence of three ubiquitous compounds: α-pinene, 1,8-cineole, and linalool.

It is important that the healthcare workforce reflect the population it serves. The Exposures Internship seeks to address this by building pathways for youth to pursue careers in research and medicine. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: In 2021, the Yale Cultural Ambassadors expressed concern about the lack of free high quality, educational offerings for youth that summer. They asked YCCI to consider developing a summer program for students aged 15 and older that focused on spurring interest in careers in healthcare, medicine, and clinical and translational research. The result was a 4-week virtual learning experience for 34 interns who met daily via Zoom and participated in course work, lectures, journal clubs, group projects, and virtual lunches with internationally renowned clinical research and healthcare leaders. Sessions were designed to help interns gain knowledge of and exposure to current topics in clinical and translational science and to observe the various steps of proposing, designing, undertaking, and analyzing clinical trials. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: YCCI received over 900 inquiries from around the world with more than 200 completed applications for participation in the internship for the pilot year. Since then, YCCI leadership has worked with community partners to engage young scholars from 17 different states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. Of those, we estimate 75% are minority, ~50% female and 20% from rural areas with limited similar opportunities. During the four weeks of the program these highly motivated students worked on projects aimed at increasing participation in pediatric research through a revised Informed consent and adolescent assent process and a youth centered awareness campaign. Interns were so inspired that they requested the program be continued beyond the initial four weeks. As such, YCCI continued to offer sessions throughout the year. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: In evaluation of the pilot program 95% of respondents strongly agreed that the program exposed them to new information about clinical and translational research.

After taking a thorough history, patients were admitted in the hospital, which was followed by a physical examination, necessary investigations, and an initial emergency management. The study did not include any follow-up cases. Corrosive ingestion induced tissue damage was assessed via endoscopy using Zargar’s classification. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 26.Results: The total number of patients who were brought to emergency department with corrosive ingestion during one year were 74. There were 45 females (60.81%) and 29 male patients (39.19%). Age ranged from 13 to 60 years (mean 27.01 ± 18.91) with highest incidence in the age group of 21-30 years which was 44.59 % followed by 11-20 age Group (28.28 %).  41 patients were unmarried (55.41%), whereas 33 were married (44.59 %). Corrosive ingestion was most common in illiterate patients (44.59 %). 46 patients (62.16%) confessed that they ingested corrosive substance intentionally while 28 (37.84 %) claimed it happened due to accidental ingestion. Washroom cleaner was found to be the most commonly used corrosive Agent (90.54%). The most common sites that sustained corrosive injuries were the oropharynx and oesophagus, while the duodenum was found to be the least affected with normal endoscopic examination in the majority of the patients (51.35 %).Conclusion:  In developing countries, corrosive ingestion is a major public health concern, with a high proportion of suicidal ingestions. It is particularly common in suicidal young people with easy access to washroom cleaners. The seriousness of this problem emphasises the importance of pursuing multidisciplinary solutions.

Individuals now require a specific set of skills, competencies and knowledge to use these devices efficiently, intelligently yet with responsibility. The purpose of this research was to design, develop and validate a digital literacy scale (DLS) using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA).Design/methodology/approachA quantitative research methodology was used for this study, whereby a unipolar 5 point Likert scale self-report questionnaire was designed to measure the digital skills of the participants. Digital literacy was divided into an exhaustive and broad list of six modules-media literacy, information literacy, communication literacy, technology literacy, visual literacy and computer literacy. The questionnaire was administered to a sample of the 2,755 Year 12 and Year 13 students of randomly selected 33 secondary school students in Fiji. Sample adequacy of the sample was tested using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test.FindingsThe EFA results prove the existence of the six modules of digital literacy that are being utilized in this research to design the DLS. The factor loadings or the correlation coefficients range from 0.3 to 0.8; therefore, all the 60 items were kept to design the DLS. The Cronbach Alpha value of 0.90 confirmed the internal consistency and reliability of the newly designed DLS.Research limitations/implicationsThe research limitation of the study was the sample size. A broader sample would have made the results better. Research implications are; there is no scale in the south Pacific to measure digital literacy. The newly designed and developed scale is the first one that can be used to measure the digital literacy of the south Pacific populace and bridge the gap of the digital divide.Practical implicationsThe developed and validated scale can be used to measure the digital literacy of individuals both in the south Pacific and beyond. The scale covers important aspects of the much needed 21st century skills. Once digital literacy is measured, relevant stakeholders can develop instruments to improve the digital literacy of individuals.Social implicationsThe DLS can prove to be an important tool for society. In the 21st century people are required to have digital literacy to survive and thrive. Thus this tool can be used to measure digital literacy and further improve the digital literacy of the people.Originality/valueThe framework has been adopted from the work of Covello (2010) however, the definitions of digital literacy and other literacies are modified to meet the requirements of the 21st century. The tool is unique in its nature in the south Pacific and beyond. Looking at the digital literacy tools in literature, this tool covers all the aspects of digital literacy in the 21st century.Peer reviewThe peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/OIR-10-2021-0532.",Online information review (Print),2022.0,23,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1108/oir-10-2021-0532?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1108/oir-10-2021-0532, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The prevalence of protozoan parasites (4.4%) was significantly higher than helminthic parasites (0.04%, P < 0.001). A significant association was observed between IPIs with age, gender, and year (P < 0.05). The prevalence of IPIs among those referred to hospitals before the COVID-19 pandemic was higher than those referred to hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic (5.8% vs 2.8%), and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The odds of infection among people investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic was about 40% lower than those investigated before the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.49–0.73, P < 0.001). Our results showed that the prevalence of IPIs has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improved sanitation, personal hygiene, and health education can be effective in reducing parasitic infections in the COVID-19 pandemic.",Environmental science and pollution research international,2022.0,12,"{'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-021-18192-w.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8783790, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As a result, the current study sought to assess food safety practices and associated factors among food handlers at Woldia University's student cafeteria. An institutional cross-sectional study was conducted between May and July 2021, and a sample of 291 subjects was recruited through a simple random sampling technique. Questionnaires, focus group discussions, interviews, and observation methods were used as data collection tools. Data analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 software. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine the effect of various factors on the outcome variable and control for confounding effects. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. However, some variables are significant even at p < 0.001. The results were described by frequencies and percentages. The current study found that the factors of not having had food hygiene training (AOR = 2.111, 95% CI = (1.029 − 4.428)), less than or equal to one year of work experience (AOR = 3.070, 95% CI = (2.020 − 10.246)), poor knowledge (AOR = 1.285, 95% CI = (0.125 − 0.849)) and poor attitude (AOR = 1.190, 95% CI = (1.361 − 9.393)), not keeping cooked food at a safe temperature (AOR = 3.037, 95% CI = (1.021 − 12.096)), failure to respect the safety of cooking utensils and surfaces (AOR = 2.022, 95% CI = (1.551 − 9.689)), insufficient cleanliness of eating areas (AOR = 2.430, 95% CI = (1.983 − 6.217)), not covering hair when cooking food (AOR = 5.903, 95% CI = (2.243 − 9.621)), and not washing hands before starting to handle food (AOR = 10.019, 95% CI = (4.031 − 24.063)) were statistically associated with unhygienic food handling practices. The results of this study indicated that the state of food safety practices was poor. Therefore, food safety assurance must comply with modern food safety frameworks such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP). In addition, addressing knowledge and skill gaps among food handlers, regular inspection services, and effective enforcement of food safety regulations are extremely essential. Finally, future studies should focus on enumerating bacteria and protozoa in unsanitary foods and utensils.",International journal of food Science,2022.0,12,"{'url': 'https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ijfs/2022/7400089.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9757932, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These makerspaces offer exposure to a wide range of tools and activities guided by equitable approaches to help break down barriers of entry to computer science fields. To build upon this work, Georgia Institute of Technology has recently started a dedicated K-12 makerspace on its campus and is piloting a two-year program with the National Center for Women & Information Technology to expose women and gender non-conforming high-school students of all backgrounds to programming and collegiate-level research in STEM areas. Using Project GUTS as a base curriculum, we focus on physical and on-screen activities that explore the concept of complex adaptive systems as physical representations within the real-world. Two research directions for the project are, first, studying how learning gains are impacted when incorporating physical representations of complex systems to the curriculum as opposed to relying purely on online simulations, and second, studying how a makerspace supports learning about complex systems in general. We are currently in the first stage of the program, working with a group of high-school students in the 2021/2022 school year. We are excited to share our ongoing process with other researchers and educators to discuss how we may improve this program for future iterations.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3478432.3499243?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3478432.3499243, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Chandler,"An experiment was conducted during the year 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 at Department of Horticulture, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj (India), to study the effects of different treatments combination under hydroponics and pot cultivation condition in climatic zones of Prayagraj for better growth and yield of strawberry. The experiment was laid out in Factorial randomized block design with three replications each consisting of two cultivation system i.e., hydroponics system and pot culture, each having 12 treatments with T0 (control). The two type (Pot Experiment + Hydroponic Experiment) of planting system, and their interaction have a significant effect on the growth and yield of the plants. According to the findings, plants cultivated in hydroponic system along T7 (with Grow, Micro & Bloom) at 24 hours interval of 42 days maximize yield while also performing best in growth, quality, and yield contributing attributes. The hydroponic system yielded 20.92 per cent and 16.91 per cent higher than soilless media and soil, respectively. The nutrient uptake was also recorded highest under this treatment leading to conclusion that nutrients are more readily available to the plants under hydroponic system as compared to soilless media or soil and gave the maximum net returns and maximum benefit: cost ratio.",International Journal of Plant &amp; Soil Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://journalijpss.com/index.php/IJPSS/article/download/2561/5126', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.9734/ijpss/2022/v34i232561?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.9734/ijpss/2022/v34i232561, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0af7f5939e4b91cb93eb446d04bda6f0d86d480e,Unusual Course of Median Nerve in the Arm and its Clinical Relevance - A Cadaveric Study,": The median nerve (C5,C6, C7,C8&T1) supplies most of the muscles of flexor compartments of the forearm and the muscles of the thenar eminence in the hand. In the arm, at the level of insertion of coracobrachialis, usually, the median nerve crosses from lateral to medial in front of the brachial artery and accompanies it along the medial side. Here we present this rare and interesting case report of an important variation in the course and relation of the median nerve in the arm. During routine dissection of a 70-year-old male cadaver allotted for the undergraduate students of the 2020-2021 batch in the department of anatomy, Sree Mookambika Institute of Medical Sciences, Kulasekharam, we found that the formation of the median nerve was normal, but at the level of insertion of coracobrachialis the median nerve crossing the brachial artery from lateral to medial side passing behind the brachial artery and accompanies along the medial side, the remaining course and relation of the median nerve is normal. The opposite upper limb was also dissected to find out any variation in its course and relation but was found to be normal. The unusual course of median nerve passing behind the brachial artery while crossing from lateral to medial side at the level of insertion of coracobrachialis should be kept in mind while performing surgeries, reduction of fractures and nerve block in the middle of the arm.",International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR),2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21275/sr22719130029?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21275/sr22719130029, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It negatively affect normal growth and development of children thereby reducing their genetic potential. The purpose of this study was to analyze the cause of rickets in children under five years and solutions available. 
Methodology: This study employed a descriptive cross-sectional approach and was conducted in the pediatric outpatients department of the Guru Tegh Bahadur (GTB) Hospital & University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS) Delhi. The study period was one year from September 2021 to September 2022 on 130 diagnosed cases of the rickets. Patients were enrolled via non- probability convenient sampling technique and a set developed inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data was collected through self-structured questionnaire after taking informed consent. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 26. 
Findings: The study found out that giving getting enough of both vitamin D and calcium is crucial to maintaining bone health and protecting against disorders like osteoporosis, a condition that is characterized by weak, brittle bones. While the daily value (DV) of vitamin D is 800 IU per day, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) differs slightly depending on your age. Children and adults ages 1–70 need approximately 600 IU of vitamin D per day. This can come from a combination of food sources and sunlight. Adults over 70 should aim for at least 800 IU (20 mcg) of vitamin D per day. The RDA for calcium also varies by age. Children ages 4–8 need about 1,000 mg of calcium daily. Children ages 9–18 need approximately 1,300 mg daily. Adults ages 19–50 need about 1,000 mg daily. Over the age of 50, most people need 1,200 mg per day. 
Conclusion: The study conclude that children aged between one and three years are more susceptible to rickets than children between four and five years. The study also conclude that lower socioeconomic background, male gender, exclusive breastfeeding, unbalanced nutrition and mother’s poor nutritional status all contribute to high incidences of rickets in children under five years. Vitamin D is necessary for calcium absorption in your body. This plays a key role in maintaining bone strength and skeletal integrity. 
Recommendations: Supplements should be added in the diet of children during breastfeeding. Also, there should be adequate sunlight exposure of children. Finally, malnutrition of both children and mothers should be treated.",Journal of Food Science and Human Nutrition,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://gprjournals.org/journals/index.php/JFSHN/article/download/72/76', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.58425/jfshn.v1i1.72?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.58425/jfshn.v1i1.72, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The treatments comprised of control, 100% RDF [recommended dose of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)], 100% RDF +20 t ha-1SSL, 100% RDF +30 t ha-1SSL, 50% RDF +20 t ha-1SSL, 60% RDF+20 t ha-1SSL, 70% RDF +20 t ha-1SSL, 50% RDF +30 t ha-1SSL, 60% RDF +30 t ha-1SSL, and 70% RDF +30 t ha-1. The experiments used a randomized block design with three replications, the results revealed that when using 100% RDF with 20 and 30 t ha-1SSL, rice and wheat growth and yield attributes were superior to when using 100% RDF alone. However, 70% RDF+ 30 t ha-1SSL provided a comparable or better growth yield than 100% RDF in RWCS. In conclusion, the use of SSL in conjunction with chemical fertilizer, i.e., 70% RDF with 20 and 30 t ha-1SSL, provided a higher yield advantage with no harmful or negative impact on the soil system and could be recommended as a potential organic amendment for a sustainable agricultural production system.",International Journal of Plant &amp; Soil Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://journalijpss.com/index.php/IJPSS/article/download/2428/4860', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.9734/ijpss/2022/v34i2231521?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.9734/ijpss/2022/v34i2231521, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This raises concerns about COVID-19 infection in pregnant women. Other than COVID-19, pregnant women are also a high-risk group for influenza infection. Influenza vaccination is used to prevent coinfection with COVID-19. Thus, this study examined the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women based on factors of worry about COVID-19 infection and a history of influenza vaccination. This study was a systematic review that assessed cross-sectional articles of the year 2020-2021 from the Pubmed, Science Direct, and Medrxiv databases with narrative analysis. There were three articles that met the criteria. The three articles showed significant relationships between concerns of being infected with COVID-19 and receiving COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in pregnant women, while a significant relationships between a history of influenza vaccination and accepting COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women were only found in two articles. Compared to the history of influenza vaccination, the concerns of being infected with COVID-19 in pregnant women were significantly more related to accepting COVID-19 vaccination, so it can be the focus of intervention to increase the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women.",International Journal of Public Health Science (IJPHS),2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ijphs.iaescore.com/index.php/IJPHS/article/download/21187/13497', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.11591/ijphs.v11i2.21187?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.11591/ijphs.v11i2.21187, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5b60c3fcb398e1028207038900cee98f6e4681f9,Global Research Trends in Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis: A Bibliometric and Visualized Study,": Aim: Post-Traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a prevalent cause of joint pain and limited movement, significantly lowering people's quality of life. In recent years, with the increase of traffic accidents and accidental injuries, the incidence of articular cartilage injury has increased, and the incidence of traumatic arthritis has greatly increased. This research aims to look into the current worldwide status and trends in this subject. Method: On the Science Citation Index-Expanded Web of Science, the publications about PTOA were searched from 1994 to 2021. The data sources were studied and indexed by the method of bibliometrics. The data sources were studied and indexed by bibliometrics. To visualise, VOS viewer and GraphPadPrism7 software conducted bibliographic coupling analysis, co-authorship analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and the analysis of publication trends in PTOA research. Result: A total of 2239 related publications were collected. Globally, the number of papers published each year and the relative research interests are increasing. The cumulative published number of PTOA research accords with Logistic growth model: f(x) =a/(1+eb-cx). The United States contributes the most to worldwide research, receives the most citations, has the highest H index, and has the highest total link strength(TLS). Most papers have been published in the journal Osteoarthritis and Cartilage. The University of Calgary is the institution that makes the greatest contribution. Studies can be divided into four clusters: Mechanism Research, Tissue Engineering, Clinical Study, and Epidemiology. The investment in clinical research is relatively small. Conclusion: The number of publications on PTOA is expected to rise in the coming years, based on current global trends. In this field, the USA Is the biggest contributor. Noteworthy are the latest hot spots, including ""Inflammation"", ""Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction"", ""Mesenchymal Stem Cell"" and ""differentiation"". Therefore, there will be more and more studies on the mechanism of PTOA, which may inspire new clinical treatments for osteoarthritis caused by trauma. keywords articular-cartilage, cartilage, Post-traumatic Osteoarthritis, Expression, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Synovial-fluid and Inflammation. keywords Repair 、 、 、 and ""clinical Joint 、 、 Follow-up 、 and Arthroplasty.",Frontiers in Medical Science Research,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://francis-press.com/uploads/papers/25B27LsT6aH3iSg3wOJBDG8zYRwfaha8mF6DEtLE.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.25236/fmsr.2022.040404?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.25236/fmsr.2022.040404, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 390 undergraduate (2 nd to 6 th year) medical students from two different public faculties of medicine in Western Saudi Arabia, during October 2021 to February 2022. The level of learning motivation was assessed using the Student’s Motivation Towards Science Learning (SMTSL). Socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health-related factors, as well as the perceived academic impact of COVID-19 were analyzed as the determinants of motivation. Additionally, the level of social support received by the student during the pandemic was assessed using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and was analyzed as a factor for motivation. Results: The mean (SD) overall SMTSL score was 117.25 (19.60) out of 175, and the histogram showed a right-skewed distribution curve indicating tendency for higher scores. SMTSL behaved as a tridimensional scale in Principal Component Analysis. The highest levels of negative impact of COVID-19 were perceived on the actual acquisition of practical skills (36.9%), followed by transition from student to doctor (24.4%), and academic goals (22.3%). Paradoxically, 51.1% perceived a positive impact on their overall interest and involvement in medical studies. Low motivation level was independently associated with MSPSS score (OR=0.96, 95% CI=0.94–0.97), history of COVID-19 infection among relatives (OR=0.40, 95%C=0.23–0.68), and perceived negative impact on career expectation (OR=3.26, 95%CI=1.74–6.13). Conclusion: The impact of COVID-19 crisis on learning motivation is determined by the level of social support received and sense of duty and responsibility among the medical student.

9f63ac1c975189d096e74517ab217dde53138806,The Pomeps Virtual Research Workshop,"DOI:10.1017/S1049096522000270 In June 2020, the Project on Middle East Political Science (POMEPS) launched a virtual research workshop for junior scholars to fill the void left by the cancelation of so many conferences and workshops due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 2021–2022 academic year, we expanded the virtual workshop dramatically to include 18 workshops dedicated to book manuscripts or journal-article manuscripts. Because of the format’s flexibility, efficiency, and advantages for diversity and inclusion, we plan to continue it even when travel becomes possible again. There are costs and risks, however, that require attention. Overall, the move to virtual research workshops has been a resounding success. Since its launch, POMEPS has conducted 24 workshops, including 82 junior-scholar authors and 58 seniorscholar discussants. Each two-hour article workshop typically features three papers, each with one assigned discussant. The authors are asked to read the other two papers, whereas discussants may but are not required to do so. As the convener and moderator, I read all of the papers and provide a second set of comments to supplement the assigned discussant. Book workshops, which are more intense, typically last 90 minutes for one paper or three hours for two papers on related themes. Each book manuscript has two dedicated readers, in addition to myself and typically one other member of the selection committee. We conducted 11 virtual bookworkshops for the 2021–2022 academic year. The buy-in from theMiddle East political science (and broader Middle East studies) community has been phenomenal. Although we cannot offer honoraria, almost all invited discussants usually agree to participate. If they are unavailable, they often offer suggestions for alternatives—which is useful when the topics of the papers or books are outside of the organizers’ areas of expertise. A Zoom meeting will never be as much fun as an in-person seminar, but the relatively small size of the group keeps everyone engaged and allows for personal interactions. Authors do not present their manuscript, assuming that it has been read in advance, which maintains a high level of engagement because there are few long spans of only listening. The virtual format allows us to more fully include scholars based in theMiddle East and Europe, for whom it otherwisemight be prohibitively expensive and pose complicated visa issues. We can offer invitations without regard to physical distance or national location. As a result, scholars from the Middle East and Europe who otherwise might have been excluded for logistical or cost reasons can participate at a high level: 40 of the 82 article authors and eight of the 11 book authors participated from outside of the United States. This also allows us to forego extensive advance planning, travel arrangements and logistics, andmultiday disruptions. The selection process actively seeks applicants from outside of the usual elite institutional networks, on the assumption that junior scholars from top schools already have support from their institution and are networked into the scholarly community. POMEPS has definite plans to continue these workshops even after the world heals; however, there are disadvantages to the format. In general, we have not heard the common complaint that online sessions are alienating, non-interactive, or unproductive. The small size and engagement-oriented organization has resulted in dynamic and productive sessions. Zoom burnout is real, however. We have found that a session lasting more than a few hours is difficult to sustain, even for the most dedicated of us. Time zones also have been an issue—we sometimes struggle to find workable times for participants who might be calling in from the West Coast of the United States and from Doha, Qatar. Moreover, there is no substitute for the informal time after inperson workshops sharing cocktails or dinner or an evening walk through a new city. We are concerned that the ease of virtual workshops will lead to a two-tier system in which non-U.S. based scholars benefit from feedback and professional development but remain excluded from the more informal social benefits of inperson events. A more significant concern about the potential for a selfdestructive dynamic is the tendency to overschedule because it is so easy and inexpensive to do so. The sheer volume of workshops enabled by the virtual format can be overwhelming, not only for the organizer who reads and comments on all of the papers almost weekly but also for the larger community. If we exhaust the pool of plausible readers and return multiple times to the same senior scholars, at some point, their enthusiasm for being a discussant inevitably will wane. Furthermore, it is possible that funders will observe the success of online models and become unwilling to fund the more expensive and unwieldy in-person events. That would be very disappointing because many new ideas and enduring partnerships are developed in those informal spaces of inperson conferences and workshops.▪",PS: Political Science & Politics,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/s1049096522000270?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049096522000270, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Experimental works are still the core method of gathering information on the usefulness of urease inhibitors in all fields within the investigated time span. From the mid-2000s, theoretical investigations emerged as a complement to experimental research, mostly in the form of molecular docking studies. As in the other fields of study, theoretical works have been accepted as part of research methods to examine the molecular interactions between compounds and urease.

b83afe9c994e3d81a80cd7f4043fefdc605274c1,Perceptions of stem students on the theory of evolution,"This study aimed to describe how the STEM students perceive the relationship between their beliefs about science and religion or Christian beliefs. The respondents of this study are the grade 12 students of Antipolo City Senior High School during the school year 2020-2021. A questionnaire was administered in two sections of grade 12 STEM students. The researcher also conducted interview from 15 selected STEM students. This qualitative method was used to examine the learning experiences and perceptions of students on the theory of evolution and creationism. The findings of this study show that STEM students viewed science and religion as different ways of understanding the world. Teachers should make a clear distinction between the roles of science and religion; the two need not be in conflict. Teachers that develop a depth of knowledge beyond what is actually expected of students will be able to confidently adjust instruction in response to students' needs and inquiries. Despite scientific evidence presented by scientists on the legitimacy of evolution, many people still adhere to their religious or Christian beliefs. The researcher recommends that each of us should have given much respect to people's different beliefs because of different cultures and traditions. The researcher also recommends that if someone feels that the theory of evolution contradicts his/her belief, he needs to be open-minded for an in-depth understanding and to weigh things right for the enlightenment of oneself.

914b0cd932a441d942c44f21b65330ba6533da15,Analysis of nest re-use by secondary cavity nesters.,"Secondary cavity nesters are birds who are not able to excavate their own cavity for nesting but nest in premade cavities including human made nest boxes. Sometimes these birds will reuse nests left over from other birds in the same year, but this comes with some risks. Old nests can contain ectoparasites that negatively impact reproductive success, and these nests may be more susceptible to predators. To understand the effects of nest re-use on reproductive success, we used citizen science data from Project NestWatch. We analyzed 697 pairs of repeated nest attempts recorded from West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia in 2021. We used contingency tables to determine if there was an association between the success (at least one of the target offspring fledged) or failure (none of the target offspring fledged) of successive nest attempts. Two different contingency tables of this type were made: one for nest re-use by the same species of bird, and one for nest re-used by birds of a different species. The results suggest that nest re-use by birds of the same species were more likely to be successful, while nest re-use by birds of different species had no clear association between success and failure. This difference between inter- and intraspecies nest re-use may be due to the smaller sample size concerning different species.",Proceedings of the West Virginia Academy of Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://pwvas.org/index.php/pwvas/article/download/933/837', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.55632/pwvas.v94i1.933?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.55632/pwvas.v94i1.933, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

86527fa7dcf07dbc7c1ef39383a706b591ac45e9,Implementing CARE Principles to Link Noongar Language and Knowledge to Western Science through the Atlas of Living Australia,"The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), Australia's national online biodiversity database, is partnering with the Noongar Boodjar Language Centre (NBALC) to promote Indigenous language and knowledge by including Noongar names for plants and animals in the ALA. Names are included in the ALA species page for each plant and animal and knowledge is built into the Noongar Plant and Animal online Encyclopedia, hosted in the ALA. We demonstrate the use of CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics (Carroll et al. 2020)) to engage, support, and deliver the project and outcomes to the Noongar people and communities working with us. 
 The ALA addresses the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016) for data management and stewardship ensuring data are findable, accessable, interoperable, and reusable. The ALA is partnering with NBALC in Perth to ensure all sharing of Noongar data is on Noongar terms. NBALC and ALA have been working with Noongar-Wadjari, a southern clan from the Fitzgerald River area in Western Australia, to collect, protect and share their language and traditional knowledge for local species.*1
 The Noongar Encyclopedia project exhibits Collective Benefit because it is a co-innovation project that was co-designed by NBALC and ALA. The project’s activities were designed by the Community-endorsed representatives, the Knowledge Holders. The aims and aspirations of the Community were included in the project design to ensure equitable outcomes. NBALC’s more than 25-year relationship with the Community, and as Noongar people themselves, meant they had a good understanding of what the Community might want from the project. These assumptions were tested and refined during the first Community consultation, before the project plan was finalised. The Community are keen for their traditional knowledge to be shared and freely available to their Community. The ALA only shared knowledge that has passed through strict consent processes. It is seen as a safe and stable digital environment for now and the future, and where the traditional knowledge can be accessed freely and easily. The link to western science knowledge is secondary to knowledge sharing for most of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities that the ALA are working with although the benefits of scientists having access to both knowledge systems is seen as a positive step in care for Country into the future.
 The Noongar Encyclopedia project ensures Noongar Authority to Control these data because NBALC, as an Aboriginal organisation, led by Noongar people, understands the rights and interests of the Communities we are working with. Protection of these rights and inclusion of Community interests are written into the project methodology as part of the project co-design. It is important to ensure the project is working with the right people within the Community. NBALC facilitates this by finding people who hold traditional knowledge, and can trace the stories back to their source. The appropriate governance of data is ensured because all collected data are stored and managed by NBALC. Project design includes rolling consent from Knowledge Holders who review all data collected, add or edit as needed, and give or deny consent for knowledge to be shared publicly through the ALA. 
 The Noongar Encyclopedia project design ensures we understand the Responsibilities (CARE ""R"") involved in Indigenous data collection, protection, management and sharing. Through the partnership with the ALA, the NBALC is expanding its capabilities and capacity for digital data collection and management. The Community is building its capabilities and capacity for working with linguists and scientists. Including the Noongar language and traditional knowledge in the ALA shows non-Indigenous users of the ALA that there is another way to name, look at, talk about and record knowledge about species. This view differs from Western science. The Noongar view everything to be connected and group things based on their use and connectivity. Western science tends to classify species based on their physical attributes. Language is the key to this alternate world view. The ALA now publishes the scientific name, the English name and the Noongar word/s. The ALA links to the alternate science view of these species through the Noongar Encyclopedia, and two other Ecological Knowledge Encyclopedias (Kamilaroi and South East Arnhem Land).
 The Noongar Encyclopedia project is constantly subjected to Ethical assessment by the Community and through stringent Western ethical assessments and reviews. The Community ethical assessment included the project undergoing a number of evaluations before it started. The projects are co-designed with NBALC to ensure they are within protocol and community expectations. The ALA are then introduced to the Community. The Community decide if they are interested in the project, if it meets their aspirations, if they feel comfortable working with the ALA and potentially other scientists. Contributing scientists or academics are introduced to the Community by the NBALC. The Community maintains the right to decline to work with any introduced scientist or academic.

With a focal plane containing 106 CCD detectors, Gaia will survey the entire sky and repeatedly observe the brightest 1,000 million objects, down to 20th magnitude, during its 5-year lifetime. Gaia’s science data comprises absolute astrometry, broad-band photometry, and low-resolution spectro-photometry. Spectroscopic data with a resolving power of 11,500 will be obtained for the brightest 150 million sources, down to 17th magnitude. The thermo-mechanical stability of the spacecraft, combined with the selection of the L2 Lissajous point of the Sun-Earth/Moon system for operations, allows stellar parallaxes to be measured with standard errors less than 10 micro-arcsecond (μas) for stars brighter than 12th magnitude, 25 μas for stars at 15th magnitude, and 300 μas at magnitude 20. Photometric standard errors are in the milli-magnitude regime. The spectroscopic data allows the measurement of radial velocities with errors of 15 km s−1 at magnitude 17. Gaia’s primary science goal is to unravel the kinematical, dynamical, and chemical structure and evolution of the Milky Way. In addition, Gaia’s data will touch many other areas of science, e.g., stellar physics, solar-system bodies, fundamental physics, and exo-planets. The Gaia spacecraft is currently in the qualification and production phase. With a launch in 2013, the final catalogue is expected in 2021.

The authors aim at building relevant instruments for assessing and forecasting the total amount of Russian science publication based on the data of two global science citation systems, i. e. Web of Science and Scopus, with de-duplicating by digital object identifier used in both systems. The related tasks are defined: selection of the method to forecast the number of Web of Science indexed articles within the “back forecast” method; development of integral index to calculate the number of publication based on Web of Science and Scopus data; calculation and forecast of the number of articles and publications by G7 and BRICS states up to the year 2021 with scientometric methods based on Web of Science and Scopus data. The authors suggest a conceptually new method to calculate the integral index of publications based on Web of Science and Scopus data to exclude duplication.

services, including a key role in climate change mitigation and adaption.
Understanding the natural history of seagrass meadows across environmental
gradients is crucial to deciphering the role of seagrasses in the global ocean.
In this data collation, spatial and temporal patterns in seagrass meadow
structure, biomass and production data are presented as a function of biotic
and abiotic habitat characteristics. The biological traits compiled include
measures of meadow structure (e.g. percent cover and shoot density),
biomass (e.g. above-ground biomass) and production (e.g. shoot
production). Categorical factors include bioregion, geotype (coastal or
estuarine), genera and year of sampling. This dataset contains data
extracted from peer-reviewed publications published between 1975 and 2020
based on a Web of Science search and includes 11 data variables across 12
seagrass genera. The dataset excludes data from mesocosm and field
experiments, contains 14 271 data points extracted from 390 publications
and is publicly available on the PANGAEA® data repository
(https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.929968; Strydom et al., 2021). The top five most studied genera are Zostera, Thalassia, Cymodocea, Halodule and Halophila (84 % of data), and the least studied genera
are Phyllospadix, Amphibolis and Thalassodendron (2.3 % of data). The data hotspot bioregion is the Tropical
Indo-Pacific (25 % of data) followed by the Tropical Atlantic (21 %),
whereas data for the other four bioregions are evenly spread (ranging
between 13 and 15 % of total data within each bioregion). From the data
compiled, 57 % related to seagrass biomass and 33 % to seagrass
structure, while the least number of data were related to seagrass
production (11 % of data). This data collation can inform several research
fields beyond seagrass ecology, such as the development of nature-based
solutions for climate change mitigation, which include readership interested
in blue carbon, engineering, fisheries, global change, conservation and
policy.

Vaccination is a powerful tool in the fight against COVID-19. The aim of the present, cross-sectional study was to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the attitude of SHSs towards vaccination. Data were collected in the form of a questionnaire from all students of nursing, physiotherapy and chiropody matriculated at a Madrid University for the academic year 2019/2020 (i.e., before the start of the pandemic [Q1]), and from all those matriculated for the year 2021/22 (i.e., c18 months after the pandemic was declared [Q2]). A multivariate analysis was performed to identify the influence of sex, degree being studied, course year and the time of answering (Q1 or Q2), on the dimensions Beliefs, Behaviours and General Attitude. Overall, 1894 questionnaires were returned (934 [49.3%] for Q1, and 960 [50.7%] for Q2), of which 70.5% were completed by students of nursing, 14% by students of physiotherapy and 15.4% by those studying chiropody. In Q2, the results for all three dimensions were significantly better (p < 0.05). The most important influencing factors were being a student of nursing, being in the final years of training (years 3 or 4), female gender and answering at the time of Q2. The results obtained are encouraging since student nurses (who showed Q1 and Q2 General Attitude scores of 3.34 and 3.47 (maximum possible 4), respectively [p < 0.05]) are the health professionals of tomorrow most likely to be involved in vaccination programmes.",Vaccines,2022.0,5,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/2/237/pdf?version=1644547159', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8877000, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ab9c9e3a4af57a8062be17dde8e9fdb4ccdcdde2,What if Peer-Review Process Is Killing Thinking-Out-of-the-Box Science?,"Scientific ideas and hypotheses may be accepted, refuted, criticized, or subject to rebuttal by researchers (e.g., Mayo and Spanos, 2008). Dogmas do not belong to the territory of science, and ending up in uncharted territories should be the most encouraging and hopeful achievement for a researcher (Lampel, 2016). However, modern science is quite different than the ideal image of a scientist in a lab coat looking for new results or staring to the horizon. The scientific world, instead of being supported by inspiration in search of new ideas or deep thinking, is now dominated by other aspects (Byers, 2014; King et al., 2018). Scientists are meticulously evaluated by their work, i.e., scientific contributions, funded projects, student tuition, and outreach activities, among others (Bornmann and Marx, 2014). To be promoted or to get a permanent position, several “tick boxes” need to be filled, especially those concerning paper production and funding securing (e.g., Moher et al., 2018; Schimanski and Alperin, 2018). These are often disconnected from the genuine goals of science, such as producing out-of-the-box ideas that are generally difficult to spread and accept (Wang et al., 2017; Mairesse and Pezzoni, 2021) or subjecting previous proposals to empirical testing to explore their reliability, a type of task that Scheiner (2013) considered as deficient in ecology. Thus, most researchers spend their time trying to get the ball rolling in this environment (Milem et al., 2000; Link et al., 2008). We are living in a zeitgeist where the number of scientific contributions is steadily increasing year after year, with hundreds of thousands of available journals to showcase our work (Larsen and Von Ins, 2010; To and Yu, 2020). However, this spectacular increase of production is not correlated to the number of new ideas, ways of thinking, or, at least, “discoveries” (Fried, 2020; Bhattacharya and Packalen, 2020). Slicing papers, multi-author contributions, revisions of reviews, meta-analyses, and empirically untested modeling approaches solely based on pure mathematics (Vora, 2018; Tolsgaard et al., 2019; Lee-Yaw et al., 2021) are on the spot, dominating the issues in elite journals (Ketcham and Crawford, 2007; Fontelo and Liu, 2018). So, the point is—why are we not developing new ideas in science as fast as we are publishing papers? Particularly, why are unconventional theories lacking despite the enormous scientific production? Let us go to the current model of peer review and see a common situation of a flawed process (Smith, 2006) and how it affects the development of new ideas or theories—for example—a review or a paper with meta-analysis that compiles information from previous papers is a “shining diamond” for journals if the topic is sound and timely.

Occupational exposure to needle‐stick injuries (NSIs) continue to have a major health problem in the healthcare systems of developing countries. Thus, this review article aimed to provide the evidence on the prevalence of NSI and associated factors among healthcare workers of developing countries. Methods The studies published from 2012 to 2019 were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, Med Nar, and Science Direct. The MeSH terms and/or keywords was used in conjunction with “AND” or “OR” (Boolean logic operators). All identified keywords and an index terms were checked across the included databases. Assessment and evaluation were taken to confirm the quality and relevance of the included articles, followed by extraction and analysis of data. Result Overall, 2021 articles were identified using specified search terms from the initial searches of the literature (2012‐2019). A total of 13 articles met eligibility criteria were included in the review. Among 6513 participants, 1009 and 2201 participants involved to determine 1‐year and throughout career prevalence, respectively. The prevalence of NSI ranged from 19.9% to 54.0% with an overall prevalence of 35.7% and 38.5 to 100% with an overall prevalence of 64.1% in the previous 1 year and throughout career, respectively. Sex, workload, needle recapping, overuse of injection, and practice of universal precautions, training, occupation, working experience, and personal protective equipment were among the factors associated with the prevalence of NSIs in developing countries. Conclusion The review indicated that NSIs have been identified as one of the most serious issues that affect the health and well‐being of healthcare workers in the majority of healthcare systems of developing countries.

6d20e101bc837af0fd1e54eb38c81314292b6c7f,Campaigning for a Global Collections Network: Improving the digital representation and visibility of natural science collections from Latin America and the Caribbean,"Global conservation of biodiversity is more important than ever before. The success of the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and monitoring strategy will depend on the availability of reliable, information-rich biodiversity data. Natural science collections throughout the world are repositories for and stewards of primary biodiversity records, which they maintain and preserve in the long-term, and can contribute to biodiversity monitoring specifically at the species and genetic diversity levels.
 Accurate and up-to-date information about scientific collections as data providers and mediators lie at the core of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data (Wilkinson 2016). The visibility and discoverability provided by collections’ digital representations promote an institution’s, a country’s and a region’s wealth in biodiversity records and data; highlight human efforts and social networks for maintaining and providing access to high-quality physical and digital records; and form the basis for attribution and effective transaction managment implementing the CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics; Carroll 2021). Providing powerful functionality, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl) is evolving into the global catalog for information on collections.
 The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region is among the most biodiverse regions of the planet. Throughout the LAC region, a wealth of initiatives exists for describing, recording, protecting and managing biodiversity and biodiversity data. The region’s many collections, their scientists, staff and volunteers are crucial partners in these endeavors. A diversity of local to national and regional networks are active, fostering communication, support and capacity building.
 Last year, the Biodiversity Crisis Response Committee (BCRC) of the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC) in cooperation with the GRSciColl team at GBIF, developed the concept and first materials for a Global Collections Network Campaign. In cooperation with the national GBIF Node, a pilot campaign was conducted in Ecuador. In addition, close connections were formed to the task group developing Latimer Core, TDWG’s upcoming collection description standard, the MaterialSample task group of Darwin Core, as well as the community developing the next-generation data infrastructure based on the Digital Extended Specimen concept (Hardisty et al. 2022) and open FAIR digital objects (Schultes and Wittenburg 2019), e.g. defined by the openDS standard.
 Building on the pilot campaign and continuing the collaboration with the GRSciColl team, a partnership endorsed by GBIF’s SPNHC node and led by two members of SPNHC’s BCRC was formed that includes biodiversity scientists, collections staff and GBIF national node managers from Argentina, Ecuador and Guatemala. Supported by the GBIF Capacity Enhancement Support Programme and starting in August 2022, the partnership has the goal to increase the number, coverage and density of high quality records available through GRSciColl, thereby providing visibility and improving the recognition of natural science collections existing within the three countries and the LAC region. The CESP project contributes towards the aim of the campaign to build step by step an equitable, inclusive and engaged Global Collections Network.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2022.0,1,"{'url': 'https://biss.pensoft.net/article/91356/download/pdf/', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.6.91356?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.6.91356, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

One entry-level Open Science practice proposed to mitigate QRPs is “study preregistration,” through which researchers outline their research questions, design, method, and analysis plans before data collection and/or analysis. In this study, we aimed to empirically test the effectiveness of preregistration as a pedagogic tool in undergraduate dissertations using a quasi-experimental design. A total of 89 UK psychology students were recruited, including students who preregistered their empirical quantitative dissertation (n = 52; experimental group) and students who did not (n = 37; control group). Attitudes toward statistics, acceptance of QRPs, and perceived understanding of Open Science were measured both before and after dissertation completion. Exploratory measures included capability, opportunity, and motivation to engage with preregistration, measured at Time 1 only. This study was conducted as a Registered Report; Stage 1 protocol: https://osf.io/9hjbw (date of in-principle acceptance: September 21, 2021). Study preregistration did not significantly affect attitudes toward statistics or acceptance of QRPs. However, students who preregistered reported greater perceived understanding of Open Science concepts from Time 1 to Time 2 compared with students who did not preregister. Exploratory analyses indicated that students who preregistered reported significantly greater capability, opportunity, and motivation to preregister. Qualitative responses revealed that preregistration was perceived to improve clarity and organization of the dissertation, prevent QRPs, and promote rigor. Disadvantages and barriers included time, perceived rigidity, and need for training. These results contribute to discussions surrounding embedding Open Science principles into research training.",Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/25152459231202724', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/25152459231202724?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459231202724, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, establishing a solid physical connection between solar and tropospheric variability has posed a considerable challenge across the spectrum of Earth-system science. Over the past few years a new picture to describe solar variability has developed, based on observing, understanding and tracing the progression, interaction and intrinsic variability of the magnetized activity bands that belong to the Sun’s 22-year magnetic activity cycle. A solar cycle’s fiducial clock does not run from the canonical min or max, instead resetting when all old cycle polarity magnetic flux is cancelled at the equator, an event dubbed the “termination” of that solar cycle, or terminator. In a recent paper, we demonstrated with high statistical significance, a correlation between the occurrence of termination of the last five solar cycles and the transition from El Niño to La Niña in the Pacific Ocean, and predicted that there would be a transition to La Niña in mid 2020. La Niña did indeed begin in mid-2020, and endured into 2023 as a rare “triple dip” event, but some of the solar predictions made did not occur until late 2021. This work examines what went right, what went wrong, the correlations between El Niño, La Niña and geomagnetic activity indices, and what might be expected for the general trends of large-scale global climate in the next decade.",Frontiers in Earth Science,2023.0,2,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2023.1204191/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/feart.2023.1204191?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2023.1204191, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

112aa283f87d2808c90703bb924ffdf5203c98b5,Postharvest horticulture: a multidisciplinary science field that enables global fresh produce trade,"New Zealand is located in a unique position, while also being unique for developed countries in that a major part of the economic success relies on the production and sale of food to the world. The first shipment of frozen meat from New Zealand to the United Kingdom in 1881 by the ship Dunedin signalled the importance of being at the cutting edge of technology in order to develop and operate the supply chains of perishable products. As such, postharvest scientists within New Zealand have and continue to make important contributions to support horticultural industries, and the unique additional challenges in the supply chain that occurs when you have a live respiring product with inherent biological variability. With rapidly expanding horticultural production within New Zealand and societal drivers to reduce meat and animal product consumption, the need for postharvest horticulture skills and technologies to ensure that products meet consumer’s needs, remains as important as ever. Postharvest science in itself represents a wide scientific skill base allowing the solutions to problems and the generation of knowledge to occur from multiple disciplines. Work presented in postharvest problems ranges from physiology (e.g. gene signalling, metabolomics and cell wall degredation) to technology (e.g. appropriate maturity definition, atmospheric manipulation, heat treatments, etc.) to engineering (e.g. sorting and packaging technologies, cool chain design and mathematical prediction systems). Each component of the postharvest science field plays a role in identifying the causes of problems, narrowing in on the mechanisms and designing solutions to solve the problem as best as possible. The Covid19 pandemic has had many impacts on society. One very noticeable effect on scientists was the inability to travel and meet our colleagues with the same intellectual passions as our own. In particular 2020 was to be a flagship year for postharvest science in New Zealand, with the return of the ISHS Postharvest Symposium, the most important conference of the field, to be held in Rotorua, New Zealand in November 2020. Unfortunately, that was not to be, with the conference delayed until 2024 (https://www.scienceevents.co. nz/postharvest2024). The biannual Plant Science Central held at Massey University in Palmerston North in 2021 was a notable relief in the midst of the pandemic. New Zealand’s tight border controls and elimination policy had led to no cases in the community for a prolonged period and created a unique opportunity for New Zealand-based Plant Scientists to be able to come together, share their work and enjoy the science and social discussions. This special issue was spun out of this conference and the fact that opportunities had been lost over the pandemic, especially for our early career colleagues, where the formation of relationships with other experts of their chosen field is an important part of their career development. This special issue comprises of a group of works, some of which were presented at Plant Science Central 2021, while others were submitted independently of the conference.

b5b0547cb320010088447f043ebfffe61d56ea97,Editorial,"In this June 2024 issue of the Science Education International, we are proud to present an array of scholarly articles that highlight the diverse and innovative approaches to science education from ten different countries: Türkiye, Greece, Estonia, Latvia, Philippines, USA, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, and China. This collection underscores the global commitment to enhancing science education through varied methodologies, cultural contexts, and unique challenges. Some of these articles were presented at the 7th ICASE World Science and Technology Education Conference, held in Dubai between March 27 and 30, 2024, further enriching the discussions with insights shared among global experts. The first article is from Türkiye. The article mentions that the rise in STEM education has led to more authors promoting Arduino in STEM. While research exists on Arduino and STEM separately, more studies on their relationship are needed. This study uses software tools (Vosviewer, Biblioshiny) and bibliometric methods, analyzing documents from Scopus (2013-2022). Performance analysis showed publication and citation trends, highlighting top contributors. Bibliographic mapping revealed conceptual, intellectual, and social structures. Results indicated prolific authors and institutes in Türkiye, with the most cited from the USA. Türkiye may soon lead due to high growth rates and younger documents. The study warns of potential monopolization and highlights the need for increased researcher mobility and collaboration. Overall, Arduino shows great promise in future STEM activities. The second article is from Greece. The article surveys primary students in Greece on their views toward STEM education based on urban or rural settings and gender. The sample included 281 students from Attica and 69 from a Greek province. Data was collected via a close-ended digital questionnaire. Most students felt good at math and science but unlikely to pursue related careers. They reported strong communication and cooperation skills. Rural students showed more confidence in improving their math and science skills, the usefulness of STEM knowledge, and awareness of environmental issues. Boys showed slightly more interest in STEM careers. The study suggests further research on geographical, gender, and socioeconomic disparities in STEM education. The third article, a case study from Estonia, aimed to enhance pre-service science teachers’ readiness for integration, inquiry-based learning (IBL), ICT use, and real-life applications in teacher training. It explored their perceptions of these methods and how their views evolved over time. A questionnaire was administered to 50 pre-service science teachers before and after their 2-year training, with data analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings showed that teachers studying multiple science subjects valued integration, IBL, ICT use, and real-life examples more, with significant perception changes over time. Nearly half did not see IBL as crucial, and only a quarter recognized the importance of ICT. The fourth article is from Latvia. The article addresses that teacher competence management and development are now school responsibilities, but school leaders often lack the tools and experience. Competence management in schools can involve identifying and implementing professional development (PD) tailored to teachers' needs. Unlike the ""one size fits all"" approach, personalized PD can be more effective. This study focuses on identifying science teacher profiles to improve teaching that promotes student conceptual understanding (CU). Using a mixed-method approach, the performance of 26 urban science teachers was observed and analyzed. The study identified six distinct teacher profiles, demonstrating varied PD needs and offering a methodology for using lesson observation data to create teacher profiles in small samples. The fifth article is the second article from Greece. The study examines 12th-grade students' understanding of ""orbital"" and ""electron cloud"" concepts in quantum contexts (n=1 and n=2) through verbal and pictorial representations. It involved 192 students from six urban schools in Northern Greece using a paper-and-pencil assessment. Results show students struggle more with verbal explanations than pictorial ones and exhibit inconsistencies between these representations. They understand the electron cloud better verbally, but the orbital better pictorially. Representations for n=2 are more challenging than for n=1. Students were categorized into four classes based on their profiles, with implications for science education discussed. The sixth article is written by researchers from the Philippines and the USA. This meta-analysis study (2017-2021) assessed the impact of Socio-Scientific Issues (SSI)-based approaches on learners' conceptual understanding, environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior. Analyzing various SSI techniques, the findings revealed a strong positive influence on understanding complex environmental issues and promoting sustainable behavior. The study noted that SSI fosters critical thinking and engagement but also identified potential publication biases. It emphasized the need for context-specific strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration in climate change education. Overall, the SSI approach helps develop proactive, environmentally conscious citizens capable of addressing global issues. The seventh article is from USA. The study investigated the impact of an active project-based, aquaculture constructivist-learning program on high school students' perceptions. It aimed to determine if the program influenced students' interest, engagement, and future educational and career aspirations in STEM fields, both inside and outside the classroom. The study also sought to understand students' knowledge about aquaculture and skill development post-program participation. Qualitative data were gathered through post-student focus groups, teacher journal reflections, and public newspaper articles from three rural high schools in Kentucky. Four main themes emerged: (1) students demonstrated excitement and enthusiasm in the hands-on aquaculture program; (2) students exhibited attention to detail in aquaculture tasks, leading to increased responsibility; (3) students engaged collaboratively with their peers; and (4) there was a greater interest and confidence in STEM through practical application. The results indicated that the program engaged learners in real-world problem-solving and decision-making situations, fostering collaboration and enhancing skills such as responsibility and self-confidence in STEM. The eighth article is from Thailand. This research assessed the ability of Thai grade 10 students to construct scientific explanations and explored differences based on learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. The study involved 231 students from Phetchaburi province, Thailand, with 77.5% demonstrating moderate ability levels. Significant differences were found in students' ability levels based on their learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. The study also revealed correlations between students' ability levels and their learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. Students with higher learning achievement, positive attitudes, and attendance at larger schools tended to have higher ability levels. However, there was no significant relationship between students' attitudes toward science and school size. These findings emphasize the importance of considering individual differences and backgrounds, particularly in terms of learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size, when teaching science. The ninth article is from United Arab Emirates (UAE). This mixed-approach study explores the effects of virtual science laboratories on students' motivation and attitude toward science. Conducted in an American curriculum private school in Dubai, the research surveyed 237 students from grades 7 to 11. Results show that virtual laboratories positively impact students' overall motivation, including intrinsic motivation, perceived usefulness, effort, perceived self-efficacy, and attitude toward science. Perceived self-efficacy and perceived usefulness significantly influence students' attitudes toward science, with perceived self-efficacy being a predictor of their effort. The tenth article is from South Africa. This study examines the effectiveness of Khan Academy Videos (KAVs) in rural thermodynamics education. 88 students were divided into two groups: one taught traditionally (control group [CG]) and the other using KAVs (experimental group [EG]). Results show significant improvement in learning outcomes and engagement with KAVs, with EG scores increasing by 61% compared to 31% in the CG. Pre-tests and post-tests were used to measure academic performance, and a mixed-method approach analyzed results and feedback. The study highlights the positive impact of KAV integration on student performance, especially in resource-limited rural schools, suggesting its transformative potential in enhancing teaching quality. The eleventh article is from China. The article analyzes 30 documents from Web of Science and CNKI databases to compare and understand the role of science teachers in China and overseas. The research highlights slow development in both Chinese and English publications, with most studies in theoretical exploration. The role of science teachers encompasses five main aspects: Role expectation, role orientation, role identification, role transformation, and role enactment. Combining the ""should be"" research from Chinese publications with the ""real"" research from English publications could lead to a more comprehensive understanding and positive interaction. This analysis provides a basis for future research on the role of science teachers.

Based on consensus on the tremendous health benefits through physical activity (PA) & exercise at all ages, it is a sound recommendation for health promotion, maintaining good health and the prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) incl. risk factors. However, since health is a complex state that has to be earned over a lifetime, one single measure to promote sustainably good health seems insufficient, particularly in childhood, adolescence and emerging adulthood since inherited health-related behaviours, habits and lifestyles track over time resulting in (good or worse) the adult state of health. Both studies aimed to investigate health-related behaviours of Austrian secondary pupils and tertiary University/college students, with a focus on PA & exercise (days per week) linked to different diet types (mixed, vegetarian, vegan).
Methods
From science 2 school (Wirnitzer, n.d.b) and From science 2 highschool & university (Wirnitzer, n.d.a) were designed as interdisciplinary cross-sectional studies, with data collection Austria nation-wide (pupils: academic year 2019/2020; students: summer semester 2021). Participation in these standardized online questionnaires was anonymous and voluntary; based on self-report, data on sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle characteristics (PA & exercise, diet, alcohol and nicotine) were collected. Both studies were approved by the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research and all 9 Austrian Federal Education Authorities.

In total, 8,799 pupils (63% girls) and 6,148 students (65.3% females) provided complete data sets. Generally, 82.4% of pupils (15.0 ± 2.3 years; 2.9 ± 2.0 days/week) and 79.3% of students (24.8 ± 6.2; 3.6 ± 1.5 days/week) reported PA & exercise as leisure time activity. Compared to non-actives, they showed significantly higher daily intakes of fruit and fluids and less smoking (p < 0.05). A mixed diet was reported by the majority of pupils and students (84.3% at age 15.2 ± 2.2 years and 71.2% at age 25.3 ± 6.9 years) versus vegetarian (8.5% and 22.8%) and vegan diets (7.2% and 6.0%), respectively. In both populations, the vegan diet (3.2 for pupils; 3.9 for students; p < 0.01) was associated with more days/week of PA & exercise compared to vegetarian (2.9 for pupils; 3.4 for students) and mixed diets (2.8 for pupils; 2.9 for students), with a significant increase in leisure sports participation across diet types: up to 86.4% in pupils (p = 0.03) and 92.9% in students (p < 0.01) for the vegan diet. More vegan pupils (74.7%; p = 0.001) and students (32.5%; p < 0.01) reported not drinking alcohol compared to non-vegan pupils (range: 51.2-53.7%) and students (range: 26.7-30.7%), while there was no difference in smoking habits across dietary subgroups.
Discussion
Both studies were the first to examine the dual approach to sustainable health based on the prevalences of PA & exercise linked to different diet types. Key results are: (1) active vs. inactive pupils and students show lifestyle behaviours more beneficial to health, and (2) vegan vs. non-vegan youth are more active and report healthier behavioural choices. A strength of both studies is that the findings are based on large samples, especially the school study was conducted on a sample size nicely in line with the Austrian WHO HBSC study. Given the detrimental health effects of insufficient PA and poor dietary choices, attention should be focused on policies and educational curricula to improve healthy lifestyle choices, at best through a dual approach to health by permanently combining the personally modifiable and most natural lifestyle factors: (1) regular PA & exercise with (2) a healthy diet, in order to shape better public health by improved individual youth health. Although there is consensus on the tremendous health benefits through PA & exercise as a single measure, lifelong health seems impossible to be achieved by a 1-dimensional approach in the long-term.
Conclusion
The present research shows an interplay between PA patterns and dietary habits, not only influencing each other but also affecting other health-related behaviors. In this study, especially adopting a vegan diet is linked with healthier lifestyle behaviour, highlighting the importance of healthy dietary choices for overall health and well-being. Therefore, and since there is huge potential left untapped (Figure 1), the promising dual approach to sustainable health is recommended as a minimum and starting point in secondary and tertiary educational settings.

a6e3a731cd82d00bd49a27da75b94ddeb17e51e9,190 The Nutrigenomic Effects of Dietary Choline and L-Carnitine on the Muscle and Liver of Lean and Overweight Cats,"
 The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary choline and L-carnitine on the lipotropic gene expression in the muscle and liver of overweight and lean cats, when fed for body weight (BW)maintenance. Overweight [n = 6, body fat percent (BF%): 33.2 ± 1.38] and lean (n = 6, BF%:18.4 ± 0.93), 1-2 year old, male, neutered cats received choline (378 mg/kg BW0.67), L-carnitine (200 mg/kg BW) and no supplementation (control) in a 3x3 Latin square design for 6 weeks, with a 2-week washout between treatments periods. Each treatment was offered with a commercial extruded diet; diet amount was provided to maintain current BW. Cats were anesthetized and quadriceps vastus lateralis (30-50 mg) and liver (30-50 mg) biopsies were harvested after each treatment period using an open muscle or laparoscopic biopsy technique respectively. Tissue RNA was isolated with TRIzol and sequenced using directional PolyA RNA-seq. The expressed genes were aligned using the reference genome, Felis_catus_9.0, Ensembl v.107. Differential gene expression was analyzed for 29,928 genes with SEQUIN, using edgeR and TMM normalization. Pathway analysis was performed using EnrichR databases, BioPlanet 2019 and KEGG 2021. Using a two-group comparison, global analysis revealed 92 and 759 differentially expressed genes in the liver and muscle, respectively of overweight cats compared with lean (P < 0.05). Affected pathways included fat digestion and absorption, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling in the liver, and immunity related pathways in muscle (P < 0.05). Upon further analysis using a two-group comparison between overweight and lean cats for each treatment, 11 and 692 significant genes were found in choline treated liver samples and L-carnitine treated muscle samples, respectively (P < 0.05). Similar to the global analysis, genes related to fat metabolism, including PPAR signaling, were significant in the choline treated liver samples, and immunity related genes were significant in the L-carnitine treated muscle samples (P < 0.05). Based on preliminary data, supplemental dietary choline may be beneficial for overweight cats as it may increase fat metabolism in the liver, mitigating risks associated with feline hepatic lipidosis (FHL). Supplemental dietary L-carnitine may also be beneficial due to its effects on immunity related pathways, including pathogen defense. To investigate the full effects of choline and L-carnitine on gene expression, further studies are warranted including older, chronically obese cats, as well as confirmed cases of FHL.

The article is devoted to the study of the relationship of students’ creativity and their emotional well-being during the period of forced distance learning. It was found that students with a higher creative potential easier coped with periods of social restrictions, felt less anxiety, were better satisfied with the distance learning process, while experiencing a lack of face-to-face communication with the instructor.Aim. The aim of the current research was to identify the relationship between students’ creativity and their emotional well-being during the period of forced self-isolation in 2020–2021.Methodology and research methods. The research was carried out within the framework of health care pedagogy. The methodological basis of the study included pedagogical principles of promotion, maintenance and restoration of emotional health; development of knowledge, skills and abilities to maintain emotional health especially during online studies. Creativity was measured with the Torrance test of creative thinking; emotional state – with a well-being questionnaire created by the authors on the Google Forms platform. The study population was represented by 387 1–4-year bachelors studying the humanities (Philology, Linguistics, History, Sociology and Pedagogy) and technical sciences (Petroleum Engineering, Computer Science) at the Tyumen Industrial University, Tyumen State University and South Ural State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University.Results. Statistical analysis confirmed the hypothesis about the relationship of students’ creativity and their emotional well-being during the quarantine period. Students with higher scores on the Originality scale experienced less anxiety and stress during the quarantine period (r = –0.36*). A negative relationship was found between the variables “Originality” and “Comfort in using PPE” (r = –0.38*), “Development” and “Satisfaction with communication with the instructor” (r = –0.41**), “Fluency” and “Comfort of using PPE” (r = –0.49**). The ways of stress relief used by students during the period of self-isolation were identified and described. It was found that more than half of the students intuitively chose creative activities (61.3%) to improve their well-being.Scientific novelty. The scientific novelty lies in an attempt to present students’ creativity as a resource that requires special activation during the period of forced self-isolation within the general framework of health care pedagogy.Practical significance. Eleven forms and methods of creative interaction with students are suggested.

b4a945a282dee7fa97843dfb5a173cb99a2320f4,Epidemiology in sailing: A systematic literature review including suggestions for injury prevention,"Introduction & Purpose 
Sailing is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide and as varied as the disciplines in sailing are the injuries. According to the definition of Neville and Folland (2009, p. 141), sailing injuries can be defined as “any physical complaint sustained by a sailor that results from sailing or sailing-related activities”, whereby sailing-related illnesses have been excluded from this review. Most of the literature focuses separately either on elite sailing, recreational sailing, or offshore circumnavigations. This systematic literature review, in contrast, aimed to combine all these different types of sailing. The aim of this study was, thus, 1) to highlight the frequencies, types, locations, and causes of injuries in sailing, and 2) to summarize possible preventive measures. 
Methods 
Following the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search limited to research published from 01.01.2005 to 10.05.2024 was performed electronically in the databases PubMed and Cochrane Library using the keywords “sailing” AND “injuries”. Exclusion criteria were non-English language and literature reviews. The literature search resulted in a total of 132 publications, thereof 112 were excluded based on their title, which was either double, not related to the disciplines of sailing or the topic of injuries. The remaining 20 publications were screened based on their abstracts. In this second round of filtering, 10 publications were excluded as they were not related to the disciplines of sailing and the topic of injuries. Finally, 10 publications were included in the present review. The selected literature was screened for the five categories of injury frequencies, types, locations, causes, and preventive measures associated with sailing. 
Results 
Injury frequency including time loss injuries and fatalitiesIn general, sailing-related injury rates vary strongly from 0.59 to 16 per 1,000 hours of sailing (Feletti et al., 2021; Neville et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2016). Thereby, sailing was ranked among the safest sports in the Olympic Games 2008; moreover, in the Olympics 2012, 1.0% of sailors sustained an injury resulting in time loss (Ryan et al., 2016). No differences in the injury rate between sexes could be observed (Crunkhorn et al., 2022). The calculated fatality rate amounts to 1.19 deaths per million sailing days (Ryan et al., 2016). 
Injury types and locationsIn sailing, the most commonly injured body parts are the upper limbs (40% of all reported sailing injuries), followed by the spine, back, neck, and head (14-30%) and the lower limbs (10-27%) (Feletti et al., 2021; Ham & Jee, 2016; Hayes et al., 2023; Landsberg & Hunt, 2023; Nathanson et al., 2010; Neville et al., 2006). The most frequently reported injuries are mild injuries such as contusions (27-40%), lacerations (19%), and abrasions (11%), which can potentially occur on the hand, shoulder, arm, knee, foot, and ankle (Feletti et al., 2021; Forycka et al., 2023; Hayes et al., 2023) as well as muscle cramps/spasms (20%) and strains/sprains (13%; Tan et al., 2016). Also, sunburns are highly frequent with 16% of all surveyed cases (Nathanson et al., 2010). Moreover, in professional sailing, overuse injuries are accountable for 24-58% of all reported injuries and primarily affect joints and ligaments (Neville et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2016). Furthermore, severe injury types include fractures (25%), torn tendons/cartilage (16%), and brain concussion (14%; Nathanson et al., 2010). 
Injury risks and causesInjuries sustained during sailing can be attributed to extrinsic as well as intrinsic risk factors. Some of the most commonly identified extrinsic causes are related to environmental conditions, such as heavy weather and solar exposure (Hayes et al., 2023; Nathanson et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2016). Further, lack of protective equipment and material failure (Nathanson et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2016) as well as impacts with part of the boat, in particular the boom, (Forycka et al., 2023; Landsberg & Hunt, 2023; Tan et al., 2016) pose major causes of injuries. Hayes et al. (2023) found that smaller boat sizes are related to a higher rate of incidents. Intrinsic risk factors include sailors’ inattentiveness, lack of communication among crew members, inadequate physical fitness, sleep deprivation, and insufficient experience (Forycka et al., 2023; Ham & Jee, 2016; Nathanson et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2016). Nevertheless, a low level of sailing credentials was not found to increase the injury risk (Hayes et al., 2023). Additionally, different repetitive tasks contribute to overuse injuries (Neville et al., 2006). Moreover, alcohol consumption has been shown to play a role in 12.2% of sailing-related deaths (Ryan et al., 2016). Finally, the most common fatal incidents are due to collisions, grounding, and falling overboard (Ryan et al., 2016). Thereby, 81.6% of deaths can be linked to not wearing a life jacket (Ryan et al., 2016). 
Preventive measuresTo prevent injuries, (UV-)protective equipment, such as gloves, helmets, shoes, insulating cloths, hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen, should be used (Feletti et al., 2021; Nathanson et al., 2010). As the likelihood of accidents rises with shorter boat sizes, Hayes et al. (2023) recommended increasing the minimum boat length. Besides, ergonomic boat design needs to be applied (Nathanson et al., 2010). To prevent accidents, gaining confidence with the boat is paramount (Hayes et al., 2023). In addition, physical training needs to be included in the sailing routine at all levels (Feletti et al., 2021; Ham & Jee, 2016). Furthermore, sufficient sleep and distraction limitation should be ensured (Forycka et al., 2023). Feletti et al. (2021) suggested regularly changing the ropes to maintain a soft structure. Mandatory first aid training and equipment are further fundamental preventive measures (Forycka et al., 2023; Hayes et al., 2023; Landsberg & Hunt, 2023). Moreover, the prohibition of being intoxicated should be extended to passengers (Ryan et al., 2016). Finally, sailors should be convinced to wear life jackets, which can be facilitated by improving their comfort and aesthetics (Nathanson et al., 2010). Educational campaigns should foster these safety habits continuously (Nathanson et al., 2010).

The results demonstrate a strongly varying injury rate of 0.59 to 16 per 1,000 hours of sailing (Feletti et al., 2021; Neville et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2016), which was found to be lower than in contact team sports, such as soccer, but similar to the incidence reported in non-contact sports, such as professional cricket (Neville et al., 2006). The calculated fatality rate of 1.19 deaths per million sailing days is comparable to the fatality rate in alpine skiing (Ryan et al., 2016). The presented risk factors lead to the suggestion of various preventive measures. Several of them, inter alia sun-protective behaviour, promotion of safety gear, coaching on proper sailing technique, physical training as well as first-aid education and equipment are deemed to be advantageous (Nathanson et al., 2010; Neville et al., 2006). However, it is questionable if other identified prevention steps, like increasing the boat size (Hayes et al., 2023) or frequently renewing the ropes (Feletti et al., 2021), automatically represent safety enhancements as the associated increase in boat weight and rope slipperiness could impair boat handling. 
Conclusion 
The present literature examination updates characteristics as well as possible risk factors for injuries in all sailing disciplines and summarizes related potential preventive measures. Further research should systematically assess the effectiveness of the different prevention options suggested. To increase safety within the sailing disciplines, the vigorous implementation of such preventive measures on the part of sailing federations seems to be of uttermost importance.

 HERBARIUM PLANT SPECIMENS AND THEIR HERBARIUM HOLDINGS 
 
 Natural history collections around the globe represent a dormant source of taxonomic and biogeographic information, as it is estimated that one to three billion specimens are included in such collections (Soberon 1999; Ariño 2010). In the case of botanical collections, the worldwide distribution of specimens across herbaria is often uneven and biased by colonialism, with most specimens housed in the global North, and in many cases resulting in a reverse latitudinal relationship between plant diversity present in nature and the location of the herbaria housing it (Park et al. 2023). As an example, Yong (2013) reviewed holdings of common and type specimens and concluded that the type specimens’ accumulation in China is less than the world average. The number of type specimens is an important reflection of botanical accumulation in a country, and the number of specimens and their origins are therefore very important in a globalized framework. Accordingly, efforts to catalogue and digitize collections, and to make them globally accessible, are important tasks for herbaria.
 
 HERBARIA IN JAPAN AND THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO (TI) HERBARIUM
 
 In Japan, 74 herbaria are registered in Index Herbariorum (Thiers 2024), accounting for more than 13 million plant specimens. Herbaria in Japan date from the 19th century, with the first herbarium founded in Japan being the University of Tokyo’s (TI) herbarium (Herbarium of the University of Tokyo 2021) established in 1877. The herbarium holds a collection of more than 1,800,000 specimens of vascular plants, corresponding to ca. 14% of the total botanical collection of Japan. Although there is no complete survey of the number of specimens in the collection, it is estimated that the TI herbarium holds 20,000 type specimens, corresponding to 1% of the total number in the collection. Within the type specimens, only a fraction of the collection is digitized and available online, including 3,793 type specimens of angiosperms (and 1,743+ type specimens from other groups newly photographed in the last year). Regarding the ferns and lycophytes, the TI herbarium holds 35 families, including more than 300,000 specimens, comprising 1068+ type specimens (with 321 confirmed holotypes, 127 isotypes, and 510 syntypes), which are now being databased.
 The TI herbarium fern and lycophyte type collection includes plants from Japan, and important collections from Korea, Manchuria, Taiwan, and many Southeast Asian countries. Collections from outside Japan were mainly gathered by Japanese botanists that were assigned to expeditions in those countries, as Japan’s national power increased rapidly after the Meiji restoration (1869–1889). For example, Takiya Kawakami, originally from the Hokkaido University, actively worked on collecting plants from Taiwan; Hiroshi Hara worked on the Himalayan flora; Takenoshin Nakai worked on the Korean flora and collected medicinal plants from Indonesia and Ceylon (Sri Lanka); and Bunzo Hayata made a huge contribution to Taiwan’s flora. The specimens collected hold not only information on the taxonomic diversity, but also reflect historic events between Japan and these adjacent countries, thus proper curation of these materials is of great importance. The TI herbarium also holds unique collections, including many fern specimens collected from Seram Island (Indonesia), South America’s Andes collections by Fumio Maekawa, and Brazil’s Amazon collections by Masayuki Takeuchi.
 
 THE HIDDEN POTENTIAL OF THE TI HERBARIUM AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
 
 The TI herbarium collection is an important resource of natural history information, but its potential is still hindered by its incomplete databasing. In the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database, the Tracheophyta data from Japan currently consists of 3,503,623 herbarium specimens (GBIF.org 2024). Most of the data is from the TNS herbarium (500,060 specimens, National Museum of Nature and Science 2024), Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History (318,574 specimens, Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History 2024) and Nagano Environmental Conservation Research Institute (170,889 specimens, Nagano Prefecture 2023). The University of Tokyo's TI herbarium data only contains 40,382 specimens, not including any ferns or lycophytes, restricting access to the collection for researchers abroad. The TI herbarium mission now is to properly catalogue and make that information available, especially to those based in regions from where the plants were originally collected. Since 1981, many scientists have contributed to the cataloguing of the type specimens in the TI herbarium, with some of this data made available online. However, it is estimated that this database covers less than 10% of the collection, and does yet not include the ferns or lycophytes. We see the development of an open-access database for the TI herbarium as of utmost importance, as the herbarium represents an important historical and biodiversity account for East Asia.",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2024.0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.138439', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.8.138439?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.138439, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The provision of obstetric services, encompassing antenatal care, delivery and postnatal care, plays a pivotal role in reducing maternal mortality and ensuring positive birth outcomes. However, the quality and accessibility of obstetric services are influenced by various factors, including healthcare infrastructure, staffing levels and healthcare policies. Objective: To determine obstetric service delivery trends and healthcare staffing at a teaching hospital in southwest Nigeria Methodology: This study utilized a retrospective cohort design to examine the utilization of maternity care services among women at Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Data spanning from January 2016 to December 2023 were collected from obstetric records. Analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Results: a total of 9,855 deliveries were recorded, with 4,145 Caesarean sections and 5,767 spontaneous vaginal deliveries, giving a Caesarean section rate of 42%. Overall, there seems to be some fluctuations in the total number of deliveries over the years, with the highest number observed in 2019 (1482) and the lowest in 2021 (868). The number of consultants, senior residents, junior residents, house officers, nurses and other support staff varied over the years, with different staffing levels observed in each year.

During the online PjBL process in the Interfacing and Peripheral course, various learning applications were used to facilitate the learning process. Several applications provide virtual practice spaces and can be easily accessed for free by users, such as the Tinkercad application. In this study, the Tinkercad application was used because it was suitable for the needs of the course. In the Tinkercad application, various electronic equipment, sensors, and embedded systems such as Microcontrollers are needed for device interfaces simulations. This case study involved sixty-two students of the Computer Engineering Department in the 2020/2021 academic year. Students’ creativity data were measured from their assignments through projects and questionnaires to students. The results show a significant increase in students’ creativity: while it is classified as medium, with an average of 55 scores, before implementing PjBL, it significantly increased to an average of 71 after PjBl implementation.

2cad6a4b9fa120507b0de093b9fc1cd8a827cd44,Looking back on my journey as the editor-in-chief of Animal Bioscience,"Animal Bioscience (AB) is an international journal first published in 1988 under the title AsianAustralasian Journal of Animal Sciences (AJAS) by the Asian-Australasian Association of Animal Production Societies (AAAP). Since then, it has continued its publication journey. The current journal title was adopted in 2021. I was invited to become the Editor-in-Chief (EIC) of AJAS in 2001, which has been my second job since then and my sole volunteer activity after retirement from Seoul National University in 2013. According to a previous report [1], the idea of an official international journal publication was not well accepted initially by the AAAP member countries, perceiving no real need for such a journal and the absence of a firm belief in the success of such publication activities in Asia. However, a few dedicated frontier scientists led by Professor. In K. Han, the first EIC, turned AJAS into one of the most respected global journals in the animal science category. As expected, collecting the manuscripts during the early days was challenging. The journal received less than 50 manuscripts in the first year. However, the annual count rose to almost 1,000 in a few years. Presently, authors from more than 50 countries have chosen AB to report their research work. China and Korea are the major contributing countries, similar to the case with many other international journals. Approximately 70% of submissions are from the AAAP member countries, with the remaining 30% from the non-AAAP region. The journal has made a tremendous improvement in citation frequency. When first indexed by the SCIE in 1997, the impact factor (IF) of AJAS was below 0.1, which increased to 2.7 in 2021. The total number of citations in the first year was less than 100, increasing to almost 9,000 in 2021, an approximately 100-fold increase over the past 25 years [2]. Since AB began to publish articles with a new title in 2021 and IF is calculated based on citations in the last 2 years, the first IF of AB will be released sometime in June 2023. The IF of AB will likely be lower than that of AJAS in the next few years due to the shorter exposure time of AB. However, it will not influence the combined journal IF significantly.",Science Editing,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.escienceediting.org/upload/kcse-289.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.6087/kcse.289?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.6087/kcse.289, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f9ed8ba4725fc70d718acc573aa8eec751a93ff8,Rosemarie Rizzo Parse: Creator of an Eternal Fire of Nursing,"Parse’s founding of the preeminent Nursing Science Quarterly journal is one flame from her cocreation of an eternal fire of nursing with the publication of her books The Humanbecoming Paradigm: A Transformational Worldview (Parse, 2014) and The Humanbecoming Paradigm: An Everchanging Horizon (Parse, 2021). Fire is a significant symbol to highlight the immense success in the generation and dissemination of nursing knowledge that Parse fostered through the nursing journal. Fire is one of four essential elements for life: fire, air, water, and earth (Firefighter Garage, n.d.). The fire of nursing knowledge in Nursing Science Quarterly is essential to the advancement of nursing science and its theories and frameworks. The new knowledge in the journal is presented in sections such as major articles, theoretical concerns, research issues, ethical issues, teaching-learning, practice applications, scholarly dialogue, philosophical issues, health and public policy, and global perspectives. Each section is a flame of the fire of nursing. Recently a section for PhD students was initiated to inspire them and illuminate for them the essence of nursing by creating new knowledge, using creativity and symbols of flames of fire. There is nothing like the liveliness of imagination in the creation of knowledge. When one reads the content of these sections, one can see why fire is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge (Fire, n. d.) in nursing, specifically nursing science and nursing theories. The content in the journal is applicable to nurses worldwide. The authors and the content of their writings in the journal give evidence of symbols such as creativity, desire, divinity, hope, inspiration, passion, power, purification, and spiritual enlightenment (Fire, n. d.; Firefighter Garage, n. d.; MerriamWebster, 2020). Purification involves eliminating nonnursing aspects, which still remain in nursing, as the purpose of the journal “is devoted exclusively to the enhancement of nursing knowledge” (clearly noted in each Nursing Science Quarterly issue). The work of Elizabeth Barrett illustrates how Nursing Science Quarterly helps to advance nursing knowledge. Barrett stated that Parse inspired her to create her power as knowing participation in change theory, which was published in Nursing Science Quarterly. Barrett’s power writings spearheaded a multitude of research studies and theoretical thinking that continues in various publications today. These are examples of the resonating rhythm of knowledge development fostered by this scholarly journal. Occasionally symbols of fire are seen in editorials or articles where authors have a burning zeal and passion about controversies in nursing that relate to the birthing of new ideas and concern about the resurrection of traditional ideas about nursing. The content of the journal advocates new ways for the wellbecoming of people and the healthcare system. Parse’s guardian angel must have used pandimensional awareness and nonlocal communication with her, since angel number 35 became manifest for the 35th year recognition of Nursing Science Quarterly. Angel number 35 symbolizes positive life changes such as creativity, enthusiasm, exploration, imagination, motivation, and vision (Angel Number, n.d.). All of these symbols are relevant and inherent in the various international authors’ writings in NSQ over 35 years. Imagine a resonating rhythm creating new nursing knowledge each year for 35 years, all for the advancement of nursing theory, research, and practice. This rhythm kept the fire of nursing burning brightly with multiple flames for all dimensions of nursing. Parse was able to unify nursing and with angel 35 to identify, experience, and express her fiery passion for nursing and its science with publications in the journal, all germane to her intellectual firepower. The eternal fire of nursing continues to burn, seeking knowledge for nursing science. Imagine what Parse has achieved with Nursing Science Quarterly, the fire of nursing, and angel 35, and where there is much left unspoken and unwritten of her advocacy for nursing science, research, and practice and the remarkable quality of the journal. The eternal fire of nursing is brilliant with flames for cutting edge issues yet to be imagined for the further advancement of nursing science.

Newer bibliometric indices such as Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) and article page views are emerging as supplementary measures to quantify the academic influence of research. Objective: The aim of the current study was to interrogate the relationship between novel and traditional bibliometric indices for research published in a leading surgical journal and evaluate the role of these newer indices in measuring the impact of surgical research. Methods: All articles published in JAMA Surgery between 1 January 2019 and 1 September 2021 were examined. The literature database PubMed was used to identify all articles published within the specified time period. Cumulative citation count (Web of Science), AAS and article page views were retrieved from the journal website. Statistical analysis using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r) was performed on Minitab 19. Results: A total of 1,071 articles were retrieved for further analysis. The correlation (95% CI) between ranks for all articles was 0.635 (0.594-0.673) for AAS and citation scores, 0.680 (0.642-0.714) for citations and article page views, and 0.813 (0.788-0.835) for AAS and article page views.

fa1a666deece3704663a784934e5e07779af1aac,Common Readout Unit (CRU) - A new readout architecture for the ALICE experiment,"The ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is presently going for a major upgrade in order to fully exploit the scientific potential of the upcoming high luminosity run, scheduled to start in the year 2021. The high interaction rate and the large event size will result in an experimental data flow of about 1 TB/s from the detectors, which need to be processed before sending to the online computing system and data storage. This processing is done in a dedicated Common Readout Unit (CRU), proposed for data aggregation, trigger and timing distribution and control moderation. It act as common interface between sub-detector electronic systems, computing system and trigger processors. The interface links include GBT, TTC-PON and PCIe. GBT (Gigabit transceiver) is used for detector data payload transmission and fixed latency path for trigger distribution between CRU and detector readout electronics. TTC-PON (Timing, Trigger and Control via Passive Optical Network) is employed for time multiplex trigger distribution between CRU and Central Trigger Processor (CTP). PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) is the high-speed serial computer expansion bus standard for bulk data transport between CRU boards and processors. In this article, we give an overview of CRU architecture in ALICE, discuss the different interfaces, along with the firmware design and implementation of CRU on the LHCb PCIe40 board.",,2016.0,33,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1748-0221/11/03/C03021?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/11/03/C03021, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

But the agency will just be along for the ride. Rather than unveiling plans for its own spacecraft, NASA will name the private companies it will pay to carry science experiments to the moon on small robotic landers. Under a program called Commercial Lunar Payload Services, NASA would buy space aboard a couple of launches a year, starting in 2021. The effort is similar to an agency program that paid private space companies such as Elon Musk9s SpaceX to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. Scientists are lining up for a ride.

99acc0adc7623e2cd62da8bd45db4519154fad32,498 Investing in Translational Science: Forging Critical Connections with Investment Professionals,"OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The Virtual CTSA Visiting Scholars Program allows KL2 scholars to serve as visiting professors at host CTSA consortium institutions. This program facilitates connections with faculty outside scholars home institutions, as well as fostering collaboration among different CTSA hubs. Stanford aimed to incorporate participants into its KL2 program. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Stanford is one of 57 host institutions for the Virtual CTSA Visiting Scholars Program. The program includes a virtual meeting between each participant and a chosen faculty at the host institution. Program participants also give a virtual Grand Rounds lecture, open to the entire CTSA consortium. As well as encouraging Spectrum KL2 Scholars to participate in the virtual exchange, the Spectrum KL2 program incorporated the visiting scholars into weekly activities over the course of 3 months. Visiting scholars were invited to participate virtually in KL2 educational sessions, which provide career development training and mentoring. As meetings transitioned to in-person, KL2 scholars were allowed to attend virtually when needed. Hybrid in-person sessions were also conducive to participation by visiting scholars. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Stanfords Spectrum KL2 program was virtual (Zoom) for academic year 2020-2021 and included 1:1 mentoring sessions, weekly career development seminars, and 1:1 peer virtual lunches to integrate the 9 junior faculty scholars. Visiting scholars joined the weekly Zoom meetings when their schedules allowed. KL2 faculty mentored visiting scholars for 3 months, exchanging ideas and forming collaborations. Each visiting participant was paired with a KL2 Scholar, who provided 1:1 peer mentorship. In addition, visiting scholars presented a work-in-progress seminar, to obtain feedback before the more formal Grand Rounds lecture. For academic year 2021-2022, Spectrum KL2 meetings include virtual and hybrid in-person sessions, allowing visiting scholars to join by Zoom during the 3-month virtual exchange program. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: What set Stanfords Virtual CTSA Visiting Scholars Program apart was faculty engagement and mentorship provided to visiting participants. By incorporating visiting scholars virtually into the ongoing KL2 education program, participants could engage fully with mentors and scholars, even surpassing opportunities of pre-pandemic on-site visits.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/092C9E81174BC0F02DAF11CF1E3AE207/S205986612200293Xa.pdf/div-class-title-498-investing-in-translational-science-forging-critical-connections-with-investment-professionals-div.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9209304, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

153d6cd91fcf107629f2b2e32407561e4acae23a,How COVID-19 Affected the Journal Impact Factor of High Impact Medical Journals: Bibliometric Analysis,"Background Journal impact factor (IF) is the leading method of scholarly assessment in today’s research world, influencing where scholars submit their research and where funders distribute their resources. COVID-19, one of the most serious health crises, resulted in an unprecedented surge of publications across all areas of knowledge. An important question is whether COVID-19 affected the gold standard of scholarly assessment. Objective In this paper, we aimed to comprehensively compare the productivity trends of COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 literature as well as track their evolution and scholarly impact across 3 consecutive calendar years. Methods We took as an example 6 high-impact medical journals (Annals of Internal Medicine [Annals], The British Medical Journal [The BMJ], Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA], The Lancet, Nature Medicine [NatMed], and The New England Journal of Medicine [NEJM]) and searched the literature using the Web of Science database for manuscripts published between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. To assess the effect of COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 literature in their scholarly impact, we calculated their annual IFs and percentage changes. Thereafter, we estimated the citation probability of COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 publications along with their rates of publication and citation by journal. Results A significant increase in IF change for manuscripts including COVID-19 published from 2019 to 2020 (P=.002; Annals: 283%; The BMJ: 199%; JAMA: 208%; The Lancet: 392%; NatMed: 111%; and NEJM: 196%) and to 2021 (P=.007; Annals: 41%; The BMJ: 90%; JAMA: 6%; The Lancet: 22%; NatMed: 53%; and NEJM: 72%) was seen, against non–COVID-19 ones. The likelihood of highly cited publications was significantly increased in COVID-19 manuscripts between 2019 and 2021 (Annals: z=3.4, P<.001; The BMJ: z=4.0, P<.001; JAMA: z=3.8, P<.001; The Lancet: z=3.5, P<.001; NatMed: z=5.2, P<.001; and NEJM: z=4.7, P<.001). The publication and citation rates of COVID-19 publications followed a positive trajectory, as opposed to non–COVID-19. The citation rate for COVID-19 publications peaked by the second quarter of 2020 while that of the publication rate approximately a year later. Conclusions The rapid surge of COVID-19 publications emphasized the capacity of scientific communities to respond against a global health emergency, yet inflated IFs create ambiguity as benchmark tools for assessing scholarly impact. The immediate implication is a loss in value of and trust in journal IFs as metrics of research and scientific rigor perceived by academia and society. Loss of confidence toward procedures employed by highly reputable publishers may incentivize authors to exploit the publication process by monopolizing their research on COVID-19 and encourage them to publish in journals of predatory behavior.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2022.0,34,"{'url': 'https://www.jmir.org/2022/12/e43089/PDF', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9778719, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

39bdca1cc716bfa55d5b52f45599d8c6992d5bb6,"COVID-19 pandemic in Saint Petersburg, Russia: Combining population-based serological study and surveillance data","Background The COVID-19 pandemic in Russia has already resulted in 500,000 excess deaths, with more than 5.6 million cases registered officially by July 2021. Surveillance based on case reporting has become the core pandemic monitoring method in the country and globally. However, population-based seroprevalence studies may provide an unbiased estimate of the actual disease spread and, in combination with multiple surveillance tools, help to define the pandemic course. This study summarises results from four consecutive serological surveys conducted between May 2020 and April 2021 at St. Petersburg, Russia and combines them with other SARS-CoV-2 surveillance data. Methods We conducted four serological surveys of two random samples (May–June, July–August, October–December 2020, and February–April 2021) from adults residing in St. Petersburg recruited with the random digit dialing (RDD), accompanied by a telephone interview to collect information on both individuals who accepted and declined the invitation for testing and account for non-response. We have used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay CoronaPass total antibodies test (Genetico, Moscow, Russia) to report seroprevalence. We corrected the estimates for non-response using the bivariate probit model and also accounted the test performance characteristics, obtained from independent assay evaluation. In addition, we have summarised the official registered cases statistics, the number of hospitalised patients, the number of COVID-19 deaths, excess deaths, tests performed, data from the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) surveillance, the vaccination uptake, and St. Petersburg search and mobility trends. The infection fatality ratios (IFR) have been calculated using the Bayesian evidence synthesis model. Findings After calling 113,017 random mobile phones we have reached 14,118 individuals who responded to computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and 2,413 provided blood samples at least once through the seroprevalence study. The adjusted seroprevalence in May–June, 2020 was 9.7% (95%: 7.7–11.7), 13.3% (95% 9.9–16.6) in July–August, 2020, 22.9% (95%: 20.3–25.5) in October–December, 2021 and 43.9% (95%: 39.7–48.0) in February–April, 2021. History of any symptoms, history of COVID-19 tests, and non-smoking status were significant predictors for higher seroprevalence. Most individuals remained seropositive with a maximum 10 months follow-up. 92.7% (95% CI 87.9–95.7) of participants who have reported at least one vaccine dose were seropositive. Hospitalisation and COVID-19 death statistics and search terms trends reflected the pandemic course better than the official case count, especially during the spring 2020. SARS-CoV-2 circulation showed rather low genetic SARS-CoV-2 lineages diversity that increased in the spring 2021. Local VOC (AT.1) was spreading till April 2021, but B.1.617.2 substituted all other lineages by June 2021. The IFR based on the excess deaths was equal to 1.04 (95% CI 0.80–1.31) for the adult population and 0.86% (95% CI 0.66–1.08) for the entire population. Conclusion Approximately one year after the COVID-19 pandemic about 45% of St. Petersburg, Russia residents contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Combined with vaccination uptake of about 10% it was enough to slow the pandemic at the present level of all mitigation measures until the Delta VOC started to spread. Combination of several surveillance tools provides a comprehensive pandemic picture.",PLoS ONE,2022.0,8,"{'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266945&type=printable', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9200332, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The 5-year, $7 million campaign, awarded last month by the National Science Foundation, will mark the first large U.S. ice drilling program in Greenland in more than 25 years. But unlike past projects, the target is not the climate records held in the ice, but the rocks underneath, which contain radioactive clocks that show when they were last exposed to air. Recent evidence has suggested much of the ice sheet disappeared during the past million years, when temperatures were similar to today9s. The project will hunt for signs of that retreat, while also searching for signs of melting ice on the sheets9 margins from a warm period 8000 years ago.

ba9ac0bc377ee8707470dad1bfe44104e2547436,Impact of COVID-19 on School Populations and Associated Factors: A Systematic Review,"Apart from the severe impact on public health and well-being, the chain effect resulting from the COVID-19 health crisis is a profound disruption for various other sectors, notably in education. COVID-19 has driven massive transformation in many aspects of the educational landscape, particularly as teaching and learning shifted online due to school closure. Despite the many impacts of the health crises on school populations, a systematic review regarding this particular issue has yet to be conducted. This study, therefore, attempts to comprehensively review the impact of health crises on school populations (student, teacher, parent, and school administration). An extensive literature search guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting checklist was performed in two selected databases, namely Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus to identify how this particular topic was previously studied. Exclusion and inclusion criteria were set to ensure that only research papers written in English from the year 2000 to the present (April 2021) were included. From a total of 457 studies screened, only 41 of them were deemed eligible to be included for qualitative synthesis. The findings revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic was the only health crisis discussed when it comes to investigating the impact of health crises on school populations. This study found four notable consequences of health crises on school populations, which are impacts on mental health, teaching and learning, quality of life, and physical health. Among factors associated with the impact of the health crises are; demographic factors, concerns about the pandemic, education-related factors, health-related factors, geographic factors, economic concerns, teaching challenges, and parenting in the pandemic. This study is expected to be a reference for future works in formulating crises mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of health crises on schools by exploring the contexts of the crises.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,25,"{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/7/4024/pdf?version=1648524383', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8997877, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

036eb454da369f15f00b845708f9ffb02d495963,Emotion regulation and psychological and physical health during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown.,"The current research tests the links between emotion regulation and psychological and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Study 1, parents (N = 365) who had reported on their psychological and physical health prior to the pandemic completed the same health assessments along with their use of emotion regulation strategies when confined in the home with their school-aged children during a nationwide lockdown. In Study 2, individuals (N = 1,607) from a nationally representative panel study completed similar measures of psychological and physical health and use of emotion regulation strategies one-year prior to the lockdown and then again during the lockdown. Accounting for prepandemic psychological health, greater rumination and emotional suppression were independently associated with poorer psychological health (greater depressive symptoms and psychological distress, lower emotional and personal well-being), even when controlling for the emotional challenges of the pandemic (emotion control difficulties, perceived support; Studies 1 and 2) and a range of demographic covariates (Study 2). Greater rumination was also associated with greater fatigue in both studies, but greater rumination and emotional suppression were only independently associated with poorer perceptions of physical health in Study 2. The results for cognitive reappraisal were mixed; positive associations with personal well-being and general health only emerged in Study 2. The results provide evidence that key models in affective science help explain differences in psychological and physical health within the throes of a real-world demanding context and thus offer targets to help facilitate health and resilience during the pandemic (and other crises).

722b8517c941a18cbd262e40beab76e9bc8d0e7a,Effect of Evolving Design Requirements on Students' Motivation,"In 2008, Gannon University was awarded a National Science Foundation S-STEM grant, known as SEECS (Scholars of Excellence in Engineering and Computer Science) which provided scholarship funding for academically talented students having financial need. Since then, the grant has been funded twice more; the current award period started in 2017 and will run until 2021. As a requirement for the SEECS program, all students must participate in a community-based design project, undertaken for a non-profit entity in the local region. This project is nominally a two-year effort, though some projects have taken longer to complete. Recently, a project has experienced several significant setbacks: 1) the original project sponsor decommitted at the end of the first year due to funding concerns; 2) the project location changed four times due to uncertain sponsor requirement and city regulations; 3) the design itself has required substantial alteration several times due to unexpected circumstances (largely due to sponsor issues.) After two and a half years, the project remains only about 50% complete, still requiring additional system level design, installation and testing. This team of SEECS students has been coping with each “sharp turn” of the project as well as may be expected. They have produced design sketches, prototypes, and conference presentations. Yet signs of confusion, frustration, and low motivation level have been observed among students and have been evidenced through student satisfaction surveys, which are administered to all SEECS students each semester. This work-in progress paper details the evolution of student perceptions of the validity of the project, compares that evolution to historic data obtained from previous design groups, and speculates about the cause/effect relationship between externally-imposed design changes and student perceptions. In particular, the effect of design changes on student enthusiasm and sense of purpose is to be examined. Preliminary conclusions and trends will be drawn from the study. The periodic evaluation, adjustment and intervention of advising will be suggested to guide students to fully benefit from such real-life project experience.",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,2019.0,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37008.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37008?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37008, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In addition, large-scale hydropower projects are usually built in mountain and canyon areas with active geological structure movement, which provides rich material sources for the occurrence of landslides, so it is of great significance to monitor the deformation in the landslide source area of the reservoir. As science and technology have been leaping forward, a wide variety of high and novel technologies have been proposed, which can be adopted to monitor landslide deformation. It is noteworthy that InSAR is capable of monitoring target monitoring areas all time under all weathers without the need to install any equipment. In this study, the time series deformation of the main landslide source area of the Baihetan reservoir after water storage was determined based on the time series InSAR method. The average annual deformation rate of the landslide source area of the Baihetan reservoir from April 2021 to January 2023 was determined by combining the Sentinel-1 SAR data of 55 ascending tracks and 46 descending tracks. Moreover, the vegetation cover variations from April 2021 to January 2023 in the study area were determined by combining the remote sensing data of Landsat8-9. A total of four typical source areas were selected based on the field investigation to analyze the deformation monitoring results and the vegetation cover variations. As indicated by the results: 1) After water storage, the slope deformation in all source areas was larger in the short term, and the deformation rate of the lower part turned out to be more significant, and the deformation rate exceeded 334.583 mm/year. 2) On the steep slope, the effect of different types of vegetation on restraining deformation was different. The optimal effect was reported in shrubs, followed by grasslands, and the worst effect was reported in woodlands. The results of this study can provide scientific support for the prevention and control of regional geological disasters.",Frontiers in Earth Science,2023.0,3,"{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2023.1253272/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3389/feart.2023.1253272?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2023.1253272, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is cultivated over 163.2 million hectares globally, with an average production of 4.6 tons per hectare by the year 2015 and it is forecasted that global paddy production will be increased by 0.9 % by the year 2017 [FAO, 2015]. In India, the total area under rice cultivation was 43mha with the total production of 104.32 million tons during the year 2016-17. The expected production during the year 2016-17 was 109.15 million tons [Directorate of Economics and statistics, Commodity profile for rice, 2017]. It has been forecasted that, India needs to produce 113.3 mt rice to feed the increasing population by the year 2021 (Kumar, 2009). This demand will have to be supplied from less land, with less water, less labor and fewer chemicals. Rice being affected by various insects, pests, fungi, bacteria and nematodes are the major factors behind the yield instability.

 The ASME Journal of Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Science (https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/nuclearengineering) celebrates its seventh year (our first issue was published in January of 2015). On this occasion, I would like to congratulate all members of our Journal Board, reviewers (their names are listed at the end of this greeting), authors, and readers with this date!
 Year 2021 was quite challenging again to everybody and to our Journal as well due to continuous spreading of the coronavirus around the world, quarantine measures, working from home, etc. Also, unfortunately, many nuclear-engineering / radiation-science conferences were cancelled, moved to next year, or conducted virtually. Therefore, we would like to invite authors from these conferences to submit their augmented and revised papers to our Journal with the objective to publish as soon as possible their valuable research / technical results.
 We pay special attention to papers from young scientists, researchers, engineers, and students to be sure that we will have smooth transition from one generation of nuclear experts to another. As such, in addition to regular papers from young specialists, we have managed to prepare a Special Issue (SI) with selected papers from the International Youth Nuclear Congress (IYNC) 2020 (Sydney, Australia), and plan to have several similar SIs in the near future.
 During our seventh year, we have published four issues electronically and as hard copies (as planned, always on time or ahead of a schedule) with about 100 papers including two Special Issues with selected augmented and revised papers.",Journal of Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Science,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/nuclearengineering/article-pdf/7/1/010201/6617782/ners_007_01_010201.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1115/1.4048722?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4048722, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f7f0f313c4bc9afba74e01e63634969c6b70a670,Visualizing Environments of Modern Scripting Languages,": A central learning objective of introductory programming courses is a thorough understanding of environments that arise when programs written in modern programming languages run. An awareness is arising in the CS-Ed community that a mental model based on a runtime stack does not do justice to languages that combine lexical scoping with first-class functions. As a result, debugging and visualization tools designed around a runtime stack are not suitable for this family of languages, which includes Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Lua, Java, and Scheme. As a suitable mental model for environments in these languages, the classical programming textbook “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs” (SICP) introduced the environment model of computation using diagrammatic graphics. The SICP authors Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman designed the environment model to represent the runtime data structures required for executing programs written in such languages while blending out all forms of control. In this paper, we describe a novel tool for automatically and interactively visualizing the execution environments of programs written in the targeted language family. After introducing the environment model in detail, we highlight the main challenges for its automatic and interactive visualization. We outline the architecture of the tool and its integration into a web-based environment for learning the structure and interpretation of computer programs and conclude with an analysis of the tool’s impact based on feedback from 69 course facilitators in Academic Year 2021/22.",International Conference on Computer Supported Education,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.5220/0011766700003470', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5220/0011766700003470?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5220/0011766700003470, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

69acb80c5d2c3d4f28bd784ca6b782174c10e9a1,Elucidating the effects of peer review,"Objective. The ability of peer review to improve the scientific endeavour, e.g., conduct, reporting, and validity of study findings, is increasingly being questioned (Tennant & Ross-Hellauer, 2020) and calls have been made to showcase changes that occurred to each study due to peer review (Limbu, 2020). Until such transparency is achieved, our objective is to identify and collect studies that analysed differences between preprints or submitted manuscripts and peer reviewed journal articles. 
Design. We identified studies based on our knowledge of the field and by checking all research at peer review conferences (presented as podium presentations or posters). We also checked references of identified studies. For all included studies we then extracted the year of publication, sampling method, conflicts of interest, funding, data and protocol sharing, number of analysed version-pairs, sample size calculation, scholarly discipline, method used to compare versions, variables (i.e., manuscript sections) analysed for changes, and metric with which the changes were quantified or qualitatively classified. Future steps will include a search of bibliographic databases (and preprint servers) and launching of an online form that will allow anyone to submit missed studies for inclusion in the review. Current findings are only descriptive, but meta-analyses are planned. 
Results. Of 25 studies published from 1990 till the end of 2021, 16 analysed changes between submitted and published papers and 9 between preprints and published papers. Changes were most often analysed by filling out questionnaires or scoring each of the two manuscript versions separately (n=11) or by comparing them visually (n=6). Median number of analysed version-pairs was 59 (IQR, 41- 122). Most studies analysed changes in health (n=18) or social sciences (n=4) manuscripts. Overall, they find a very high similarity between version-pairs, with largest changes occurring in introduction and discussion sections. 
Conclusions. Current results indicate that submitted or pre-printed manuscript versions and their peer-reviewed journal version are very similar, with main (analysis) methods and main findings rarely changing. Quantification of these results is pending. Large differences between studies, type of changes, and methods with which they were measured indicate greater need for collaboration in the peer-review field and for core outcome measures for manuscript version changes.",PUBMET - Conference Scholarly Publishing Context Open Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://morepress.unizd.hr/journals/index.php/pubmet/article/download/3941/4676', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.15291/pubmet.3941?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.15291/pubmet.3941, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Operating at both L-band and S-band wavelengths, NISAR will acquire data globally to address three mission science themes: The Earth’s surface and interior; the Earth’s cryosphere; and the Earth’s ecosystems. NISAR is planned for launch in late 2021 or early 2022. The L-band SAR will have several modes up to and including fully polarimetric modes with most modes supporting a split spectrum to facilitate the correction of ionospheric delays; NISAR will support selectable bandwidths between 5 MHz and 80 MHz. The mission will be capable of acquiring SAR data every 12-day repeat orbit for both ascending and descending orbit directions over most if not all of the Earth’s land surface during the nominal 3-year mission duration. Orbit tube repeatability for this left-looking SAR mission will be better than 500 m.

5435c20da1f0cf52f341c7e3ae5286572a3723bf,Beyond history and “on a roll”: The list of the most well‐studied human protein structures and overall trends in the protein data bank,"Of the roughly 20,000 canonical human protein sequences, as of January 20, 2021, 7,077 proteins have had their full or partial, medium‐ to high‐resolution structures determined by x‐ray crystallography or other methods. Which of these proteins dominate the protein data bank (the PDB) and why? In this paper, we list the 273 top human protein structures based on the number of their PDB entries. This set of proteins accounts for more than 40% of all available human PDB entries and represent past trends as well as current status for protein structural biology. We briefly discuss the relationship which some of the prominent protein structures have with protein research as a whole and mention their relevance to human diseases. The top‐10 soluble and membrane proteins are all well‐known (most of their first structures being deposited more than 30 years ago). Overall, there is no dramatic change in recent trends in the PDB. Remarkably, the number of structure depositions has grown nearly exponentially over the last 10 or more years (with a doubling time of 7 years for proteins, obtained from any organism). Growth in human protein structures is slightly faster (at 5.9 years).

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, “Combating Climate Change and Improving Air Quality in a Global Pandemic” was chosen as the theme of this year’s conference. High challenges have been faced by our team members to manage this event due to the Covid-19. However, with the collaboration and hard work among committee members and participants this event was successfully conducted virtually and managed remotely from Bangi Resort Hotel, Putrajaya and from University Malaysia Terengganu as a second centre. With that, the conference had emphasized interdisciplinary research along with practices and fosters exchanges among tiscientists, practitioners, professionals and young researchers in finding solutions and sharing latest technology in aerosol and air quality studies and work during this situation. It was an honour to receive more than 50 papers submitted to the conference and I am very pleased to announce that around 17 papers have been selected to be published in the IOP proceeding. All papers which have been accepted were subjected to a rigorous peer-reviewing process to ensure quality and consistency. Hence, it is vital to tackle air quality issues. The conference also served as an opportunity in establishing networking among scientists, practitioners, professionals and young researchers in international regions in strengthening international collaboration. A wide range of topics was covered from fundamental, applied and technology aspects of aerosol science and air quality that focused on monitoring, control strategies, health impact, policy and management, big data and air pollution modelling using earth observation data, atmospheric transport and emissions from combustion process.

5ca4ffdd60680ca206ee4defba311f2fb03347c1,Welcome to Our Editorial Board Members,"We are delighted to formally introduce our editorial board for 2019 to 2021. As some of you may know, as soon as the renewal of my editorship was confirmed last year, I initiated discussions about possible candidates with senior editors and advisers and informally canvassed people. We are delighted that most of the current editors kindly agreed to be with us for another three years and that those who are new to EASTS generously accepted our invitation. The structure of our editorial board has beenmodified several times, and three of the changes have been significant. First of all, we recognized the transnational and transcultural trend in doing East Asian STS and removed local committees (such as those for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and outside of East Asia) so that editors could be selected with more flexibility by their specialty and intellectual affinity. Next, we invited some relatively junior scholars to serve on our advisory board, choosing them with an eye toward the emerging fields and territories EASTS wished to develop. One of the fruits of this move was our special “Reconstructing the Archipelago” issue (11.1, guest edited by Sulfikar Amir), arguably the first on Indonesia in any STS journal. And now it’s time for our third change. To function as the core of our board, we are increasing the number of associate editors and are establishing clearer roles for editors based in Taiwan. For other editors, we are clarifying their responsibilities and possible contributions to our journal. Both the book review and advisory boards are to be expanded: they reflect the rapidly changing scholarship on East Asia, and we invite them to capture the ever-moving frontiers of STS. Covers are always a powerful resource for EASTS when reaching out to those who are not familiar with East Asia. Well curated and designed, these covers are produced by a team whose members’ names are worth mentioning here. Our former editor-in-chief, Chia-Ling Wu, is and has been the first member of this team, even before it was formally created. She was joined later by our associate editor, Sean Hsiang-lin Lei, and Kuang-chi Hung, a multitalented STSer and a professor at National Taiwan University. The cover designer is Awai, who has fabulously designed EASTS covers throughout its history. We are grateful to have him with us, and we hope our artistic/STS partnership continues with the development of EASTS into a world-class journal. We do not yet think we have found the perfect way to organize our editorial board; even so, we hope that with this current structure we can better “work closely on an expanding, interactive, and also challenging STS world in which East Asia is not an East Asian Science, Technology and Society: An International Journal (2019) 13:363–366 DOI 10.1215/18752160-7755205","East Asian Science, Technology and Society: an International Journal",2019.0,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1215/18752160-7755205?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1215/18752160-7755205, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0abbcdf4a789a491aaef29cb552942958b43a30d,Minimally invasive surgery versus radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy for small-volume primary oropharyngeal carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND
More than 400,000 cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are diagnosed each year worldwide and the incidence is rising, partly as a result of human papillomavirus. Human papillomavirus-associated OPSCC affects younger patients and often presents at a higher stage; however, it is associated with a better prognosis.Until recently, first-line management of OPSCC involved chemoradiotherapy, as research had demonstrated comparable survival outcomes when compared with open surgery, with significantly decreased morbidity. However, interventions have now evolved with computerised planning and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and the advent of endoscopic head and neck surgery, which provide the potential for decreased treatment-associated morbidity.The oropharynx plays an essential role in swallowing, speech and protecting the airway as it is situated at the bifurcation of the respiratory and digestive tracts. Treatment modality recommendations are based on survival outcomes. Given the younger patient demographic, establishing the safety of modalities that potentially have better functional outcome is becoming increasingly important.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the efficacy of endoscopic head and neck surgery (transoral robotic surgery or transoral laser microsurgery) for small-volume, primary (T1-2, N0-2) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) in comparison to radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy.


SEARCH METHODS
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 10); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 8 November 2016.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials in patients with carcinoma in the oropharynx subsite (as defined by the World Health Organization classification C09, C10). Cancers included were primary squamous cell carcinomas arising from the oropharyngeal mucosa. The tumours were classified as T1-T2 with or without nodal disease and with no evidence of distant metastatic spread. The intervention was transoral, minimally invasive surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The comparator was primary radiotherapy with or without induction or concurrent chemotherapy for the tumour. The treatments received and compared were of curative intent and patients had not undergone prior intervention, other than diagnostic biopsy.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (disease-related mortality was to be studied where possible), locoregional control, disease-free survival and progression-free survival or time to recurrence. All outcomes were to be measured at two, three and five years after diagnosis. Our secondary outcomes included quality of life, harms associated with treatment, patient satisfaction and xerostomia score.


MAIN RESULTS
No completed studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Two ongoing trials fulfilled the selection criteria, however neither are complete.'Early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx: radiotherapy versus trans-oral robotic surgery (ORATOR)' is a phase II randomised controlled trial comparing primary radiation therapy with primary transoral robotic surgery for small-volume primary (T1-2, N0-2) OPSCC. It is currently in progress with an estimated completion date of June 2021.'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 1420 (EORTC 1420-HNCG-ROG)' is a phase III, randomised study assessing the ""best of"" radiotherapy compared to transoral robotic surgery/transoral laser microsurgery in patients with T1-T2, N0 squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and base of tongue. It was due to start accrual mid-2016.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
The role of endoscopic head and neck surgery in the management of OPSCC is clearly expanding as evidenced by its more overt incorporation into the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Data are mounting regarding its outcomes both in terms of survival and lower morbidity. As confidence increases, it is being used in the management of more advanced OPSCC.Based on this review, there is currently no high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding clinical outcomes for patients with oropharyngeal cancer receiving endoscopic head and neck surgery compared with primary chemoradiotherapy.",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2016.0,72,"{'url': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6463943?pdf=render', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/14651858.CD010963.pub2?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010963.pub2, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e63afd7e7fd3d7a60301d173d14e4fae95328727,"Single Subject (N-of-1) Research Design, Data Processing, and Personal Science","Single subject research design, also known as N-of-1 research, is a scientific method in which an individual person serves as the research subject. We treat “N-of-1” and “single subject” as synonyms encompassing all scientific practice which focuses on observations made about a single person. Other names for similar and overlapping approaches include: single case experiments [1–3] single case research [4, 5], single case designs [6], and single patient trials [7]. Some authors distinguish between single subject research in general, which may be descriptive and exploratory in character, and single subject experiments that are prospectively planned and use formal methods such as randomization, blinding, or crossover comparisons. Here, we use N-of-1 and single subject research as synonymous, high level general terms for research focused on an individual rather than a group. N-of-1 research is common in applied fields of psychology, education, and human behavior where it has benefited from extensive methodical research and practical guidance for practitioners [8, 9]. However, over a half-century of study and advocacy, including pioneering publications by Guyatt et al., Larson et al., Mahon et al., and others, have failed to establish single subject science as central to research and practice in medicine [10–13]. A systematic review of 122 eligible N-of-1 studies published between 1985 and 2013 showed wide variation in methodology and reporting, reducing the power of these studies to influence practice [14]. Researchers advocating N-of-1 techniques have noted that the practical obstacles to design, conduct, analyze and apply the results for single subjects have simply been too high [15, 16]. Nevertheless the rise of personalized medicine and patient-centered research create new opportunities for using N-of-1 methods [17, 18]. Recent key publications include an extensive and comprehensive user guide for the design and implementation of N-of-1 trials [19], an update of the standard (CONSORT) for reporting N-of-1 trials [20, 21], and a special issue of the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology devoted to individual patients as the primary source and target of clinical research [22]. General public interest in gathering data about health is also growing. A Pew Internet study conducted in 2013 found that 1 in 5 Americans use some form of technology to track their health [23]. In 2016, the number of consumers in the United States who use mobile health apps increased from 16 percent in 2014 to 33 percent and the number of consumers who use health wearables increased from 9 percent to 21 percent [24]. According to data from the International Data Corporation (IDC), 104.3 million wearable devices were shipped in 2016, a number that is likely to be almost doubled by 2021 [25]. The increasing availability of home blood testing kits, wearable glucose monitors, and heart rate monitors, among other consumer health tools and services, suggest a large scale transformation of the measurement context for N-of-1 research. The combination of increased public interest and reliable measurement technologies broadly available may reduce the barriers to application of N-of-1 methodology [16, 26]. These consumer technologies have already attracted research attention. For instance, activity trackers made by Fitbit, Inc, have been deployed as instrumentation in over 450 public scientific studies [27]. Of course, application of wearables for clinical or research practice requires the technology to be valid and reliable. Research has found considerable variation of accuracy in different consumer wearables, including activity trackers [28–30], sleep trackers [31, 32], and wrist worn heart rate monitors [33, 34]. Despite this variation, there have been some notable successes. For instance, in an innovative two year study published in 2017, Li et al. demonstrated that measurement of heart rate and skin temperature using consumer wearables could predict inflammatory response as revealed by laboratory blood work showing elevated hs-CRP and onset of symptoms [35]. In presenting the articles in this focus theme, we aim to encourage attention to single subject research from from both scholars and researchers in health and biomedical informatics who may play a key role in advancing its practical methods and resolving doubts about its power and validity.",Methods of Information in Medicine,2017.0,19,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3414/ME17-03-0001?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3414/ME17-03-0001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

48a53a7079928e6774b3c396cb2a736051005634,International experience of Internet socialization of young people and their professionally oriented communication on social networks,"Introduction. At present, there is a need to train scientific personnel professionally oriented toward using modern Internet technologies. The research on the international experience of professionally oriented communication will make it possible to reveal the technologies of Internet socialization of youth and rethink the value of social networks for professional pedagogy. The aim of the study is to analyze the international experience of Internet socialization of young people and their professionally oriented communication on social networks. Materials and methods. To conduct the analysis, the authors used the Scopus and WoS databases and other international information systems, the Dimensions.ai and Lens.org services, and the VOSviewer software for building bibliometric data and analyzing the emergence of the terminological apparatus in world-class publications on the study topic. Results. The results of the search and critical rethinking of the international experience of Internet socialization of young people and their professionally oriented communication on social networks allowed using the theoretical findings of the international scientific community to rethink and refine the conceptual apparatus of professional pedagogy focused on the use of Internet-oriented technologies. The level of publication activity was also changing: there were more publications at the peak of activity and a stronger decline thereafter. For instance, in 2017, there were 900 publications, while in 2018 and 2019, publication activity decreased by 15%, stopping at the mark of 800 publications per year. In 2021, the number of publications fell by another 25% to 607 publications. The distribution map of publications made it possible to reveal the main areas of research on the problem of Internet socialization: psychology (3074 publications for the whole period), social psychology (1144 publications) and sociology (1911 publications), computer science (866 publications), and pedagogy (836 publications). Conclusion. The presented analysis of the international experience of Internet socialization of youth made it possible to identify professionally oriented technologies for the professional communication of the young generation, such as social networks, professional communities, professional Internet resources, videoconferencing systems, open education systems, distance learning technologies, Internet of Things technologies, freelancing, and remote internships.",Perspectives of science and education,2023.0,1,"{'url': 'https://pnojournalarchive2.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/pdf_230443.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32744/pse.2023.4.43?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32744/pse.2023.4.43, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b36ed6bf93bf96b0a99d5f1a412afe32a39b0e78,Forecasting of Arabica Coffee Production in Bali Province Using Support Vector Regression,": Coffee is one from 40 the leading commodities of national commodities and one of superior commodities in the province of Bali. Bali Province’s records shows an increasing growth from Arabica coffee plantations in the period covering 8,205 hectares in 2009 increased to 13,155 hectares in 2014 (Bali Central Bureau of Statistics, 2015). Based on the amount of Arabica coffee production that continues to increase, we need a study to find out the achievement of results and policies that will be carried out in order to increase the results of Arabica coffee production. Research on forecasting Arabica coffee production in Bali using Support Vector Regression and several kernels. Pearson Universal Kernel and RBF kernel. Forecasting in the future three years from 2019-2021 has increased. The test MAPE results using the Universal Person Kernel is 5.14% and the RBF kernel is 7.68%. Abstract : Generally, vehicle service is a must for the vehicle owner. However, due to tight work routines, people often forget to service their vehicles. In addition, the service process is still using a manual system, such as taking a queue number which leads to the long queue of the service time. An Android-based Motorcycle Repair Shop Information System provides a solution to remind people to do a regular service on their vehicles with a reminder feature and make online bookings. The system development uses the SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) method. The implementation process requires an Android smartphone and a computer device by using MySQL as data storage, Firebase as a notification sender, React native and Visual Studio Code are used for developing the system. The results of the UAT test (user acceptance testing) from 20 users show 55,8% answered agree to the display, features and flow of the system, 39,5% answered strongly agree to the three question parameters, and 4,7% answered disagree with the flow and display of the system. . Abstract : Beauty salons and barber shop are a necessity for almost everyone. Nowadays, the business processes of them mostly still use conventional methods. The method gives obstacles to customers who have a lot of activities, for example, they have to come directly to the beauty salon or barber shop to take the queue. In addition, it is hard to promote, communicate and assess without E-CRM media. The location is also difficult to find because there is no guide mark on Google Maps. The Geographic Information System for Booking Beauty Salon and Barber Shop provides solutions for making scheduled bookings and transactions by using the e-CRM approach as in the application of promotional features to attract customers. There are some features offered in the application, such as chat features for communication, rating and review features to assess the services obtained, and route feature as a solution to show the location of selected vendors. The implementation process requires an Android smartphone and a computer device with software including Android Studio, SQLYog, XAMPP, and Visual Studio Code. The results of the implementation is the system can be successfully applied based on experiments and testing directly. Abstract : Network security in the digital era needs more attention. IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is one of the anticipation method that can be used to protect computer server. Snort IDS only comes with terminal notification or web based, this method has a weakness which to transfer information to administrator network directly. Telegram is an open source instant messaging application. Combination between those applications, produce a perfect transformation to administrator network directly through smartphone. Contrive and testing are the best methods to build this network monitoring system. The Prevention methods is added to support this network monitoring system. Penetration testing is divided by two different types such as, DDoS and port scanning. The result of those two types penetration testing show that Snort IDS is succeeded to detect those tests. The time different between Snort detection and Bot Telegram after ten times attempt in sending messages is 77,1 seconds for Snort detection and 4,05 seconds for Bot Telegram. The time different between two types of penetration after ten times attempt is 6,1 seconds for DDoS UDP and 2 seconds for Nmap portscan. Abstract : In the modern day and era, data has become part and parcel of daily life and business. The concerns for data security have as a result of this, emerged as a major concern when seeking to prevent data leakages and data losses. The need to prevent unauthorized access to data has become a major factor affecting the survival of organizations today due to the consequences that could arise when data falls into the wrong hands. For instance, the level of credibility and trust-worthiness of various companies would be put into question wen sensitive data becomes accessed by unauthorized people. The existing traditional data security methods have not been enough preventative mechanisms to prevent loss and leakage of sensitive data. This calls for the development of a new and improved data security architecture creating the new data leakage prevention systems (IDSs/IPSs). Burgeoning research has seen new innovations and increased funding towards improvement of data security architecture. This study makes a contribution trough use of DLPs to propose hybrid data loss detection and prevention system. Signature based solutions provide accurate identification of the attacker and thus suitable for prevention, they cannot be used when unknown attacker or the attacker who uses different path attacks the system, also anomaly-based solutions can detect the unknown attacker but the false positive results are high thus limiting their allocation on systems. Due to this, in this thesis we propose a hybrid system which combines both the signature based and anomaly-based solutions which enables the detection and prevention of data loss. The study developed several prototypes that provided early warning of malicious activity including use of network traffic profiling, honey tokens and knowledge-based algorithms for data fusion and structure analysis. 8 proposed a hybrid intrusion detection system that detected and prevented malicious activity on a network. The method proved effective on evaluation for preventing data loss on a network and in dealing with considered attacks on data. 9 proposed a hybrid intrusion detection system in which a normal profile at activity intervals is first detected and then subsequently used anomalies in behavior nodes. Through considering anomaly types that detected, intrusion is then detected using predefined expert knowledge rules. Abstract : In Kenya, the number of fatalities from road accidents rise year after year due to various causes. However, these numbers differ year after year and it is very difficult to identify the causation making analysis and management of anti-accident public campaigns difficult. With the use of Bayesian networks, the causal analysis can be probabilistically estimated giving a better analysis and therefore better measures in addressing the underlying causes. This paper utilises data from the Kenya National Transport Safety Authority website which is pre-processed and prepared for use in a Bayesian network model. Thereafter a Bayesian network model is built using 70% of the dataset as the training data and 30% as testing data. The model is developed with the aid of the Weka software utilising a sample of 120 instances from the prepared data with 401 instances. Furthermore, to validate the model, a Naïve Bayes model is developed with the same dataset. The Bayesian network model results in 69.125% accuracy which is lower compared to those given by the naïve Bayes model with 72.5% accuracy possibly due to the fact that Naïve Bayes algorithm performs well even with small amounts of data. Also, from the results, the model identifies that most of the accidents are driver related with 63.8% on the Bayesian network and 78.2% on the Naïve Bayes model and therefore more need to be done in addressing the driver causes. However, more variables need to be introduced in the dataset by the transport agency. Abstract: The development of smartphones increasingly affects the human life, such as data security. The use of smartphones to maintain data security is still low, which generally only uses conventional method as security systems available on smartphone devices, such as word combinations, PINs or patterns. Various weaknesses of conventional methods cause the development of biometrics systems. Therefore, a technology is created to replace the conventional security system that is biometric security system using natural human characteristics, one of them using voice. Data security uses the android based sound biometric app using CMUSphinx as the word library. CMUSphinx does not require an internet connection to run it. MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients) is as a characteristic extraction method on a digital sound signal. Matching process with saved data uses DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) method. This study can help improve the data security of smartphone; therefore, it cannot be sabotaged or accessed by other parties that are not desired.",International journal of Computer Application Technology & Research,2020.0,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.7753/ijcatr0902.1001', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.7753/ijcatr0902.1001?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.7753/ijcatr0902.1001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

705352540654eb2040076043e254da0b2aebfc65,Key-value pairs and NoSQL databases: a novel concept to manage biologging data in data repositories,"Traditional data scheme concepts for biologging data previously relied on traditional relational databases and fixed normalized tables. In practice, this means that a repository contains separate, fixed table structures for each type of sensor data. Prominent examples are the current Wireless Remote Animal Monitoring (WRAM) data schema or the now discontinued ZoaTrack approach. While the traditional approach worked fine as long as few sensors with fixed data types were used, rapid technological development continuously introduces new sensor types and more advanced sensor platforms. This means more data providers, new data types, and rapidly increasing amounts of data. Storage solutions using relational data models generate constant requirements for additional tables, changes to existing table structures, and as a consequence, changes to the overall data scheme in the repository. Further, it becomes very difficult to adapt to emerging international standards, as any change in a particular data field in a single table may have wide ranging consequences to the overall database structure.
 A concept better suited to deal with the growing amount of sensors and sensor types is the Key-Value Pair (KVP) concept: A KVP is a data type that includes two pieces of data that have a group of key identifiers and a set of associated values. The KVP concept has been used for a long time in data exchange/transport (e.g., JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), XML). Today, very good database solutions exist (e.g., MongoDB, Apache Cassandra DB, Apache HBase) that use KVP directly as the data store. Within a KVP, there are two related data elements. The first element, the key, is a constant used to identify the data type. The other element is a value, which is a variable representing the actual measurement of the data type. In other words, instead of using two separate tables with different table structures to store data e.g., from an acceleration sensor and a GPS-sensor (Global Positioning System), we simply define key-IDs representing the different data types of a GPS-sensor and store its associated measurement values, for example: longitude, latitude, date, and time. We can then store the key-IDs for ‘Acceleration’ in the same table with it's associated unique values without requiring any change to the overall data scheme.(Fig. 1).
 The data is stored in a key-value store: a non-relational or NoSQL database specifically designed to handle key-value pairs. The obvious advantage is flexibility: A key-value store allows any new sensor type easily to be added to the repository without requiring any structural change. Furthermore, this concept allows for scalability, speed, and optimization of storage space. While the traditional concept required the input of ‘null’ for optional values, key-value stores just skip this particular optional value, resulting in smaller storage requirements. Biologging datasets also differ from more classical 'biodiversity' datasets in size: a single standard 3-axis-acceleration sensor measuring at 30 Hz (30 measurements per second) produces ca. one billion measurements per axis and year for a single individal. Thus, high scalability is a necessity when serving modern sensor systems that accumulate these vast amounts of data. Databases like MongoDB are easy to design as distributed systems. High performance comes from the flexible data structures, e.g., the possibility of storing large structures of data in a single document, which allows performance-critical queries to be made in a single request, but also from the horizontal scalability, which allows for load distribution across multiple hardware systems.
 In 2021 the former CAnMove (Center for Animal Movement) initiative at Lund University, Sweden, which previously adapted the ZoaTrack application for Swedish needs, and the WRAM biotelemetry e-infrastructure at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) joined forced within the Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (SBDI) to develop a new data model based on the KVP-concept.
 We started analyzing the data and sensor types used in the WRAM and CAnMove repositories and constructed KVPs that can cover all current data. We also added metadata descriptions for projects, datasets and sensors used (Fig. 2). The concept is currently being tested with an implementation into MongoDB.
 While different tables are used to identify the project, dataset or sampling event in a one-to-many relationship (Fig. 2), the KVP table ‘Record’ contains the actual measurements. In order to identify which sensor can take which measurements, the KVP table ‘Sensor’ serves as a ‘look-up’ table. Hence, to add new sensors types to the repository, only records in the KPV table ‘Sensor’ have to be added to update the repository to handle and store these data. Data in a KVP model are easy to parse and since we strictly use open standards when available, such as Darwin Core in our data, it is relatively easy to publish and exchange data in other formats. 
 As NoSQL databases are now mature products with many proven use cases, there is no reason to hesitate building production systems for biologging repositories based on these. Further work will be done to ensure coherence with the emerging standards for biologging data to enable seamless data sharing across other biologging repositories, such as Movebank, and data aggregation into the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).",Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,2023.0,0,"{'url': 'https://biss.pensoft.net/article/111438/download/pdf/', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3897/biss.7.111438?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.7.111438, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

bcc20f8a7af683010c07feb227bce914ddcc1be0,Lessons Learned from Evaluating Three Virtual Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Programs Using Common Instruments and Protocols (Evaluation),"Due to the COVID-19 crisis preventing face-to-face interaction, three National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded centers employed a virtual/remote format for their summer Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Programs, reaching K-12 STEM teachers across the country. Teachers participated virtually from four different states by joining engineering research teams from four different universities in three different RET programs. Lab experiences depended on the nature of the research and institution-specific guidelines for in-lab efforts, resulting in some teachers conducting lab experiments with materials sent directly to their homes, some completing their experience fully online, and some completing portions of lab work in person on campus. Each teacher developed an engineering lesson plan based on the corresponding center’s research to be implemented either in person or virtually during the 2020-2021 academic school year. Research posters, created with support from graduate student and faculty mentors, were presented to industry partners, education partners, center members, and the NSF. Support for the teachers as they implement lessons, present posters, and disseminate their developed curricula, has continued throughout the year. Common survey and interview/focus group protocols, previously designed specifically for measuring the impact of engineering education programs, were adapted and used to separately evaluate each of the three virtual programs. Strengths and suggested areas of improvement will be explored and discussed to inform future use of the common evaluation instruments. Additionally, preliminary results, highlighting general successes and challenges of shifting RET programming to a virtual/remote format across the three centers, will be discussed.",2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access Proceedings,,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/37438.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--37438?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--37438, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

22fb2c934c1792c2b486cd6514b64c3cb344dc10,The status of Earth Observation (EO) & Geo-Information Sciences in Africa – trends and challenges,"ABSTRACT Over the last 20 years, Africa has witnessed a slow but steady advancement in space-based technologies as they are increasingly recognized as an essential tool for decision-making that can leapfrog African development. A critical review on the outcome of a survey questionnaire focused on African private sector industries and universities, services and education/training in EO and Geo-Information Sciences, combined with literature review, and personal contacts reveal optimism for success in four sectors. These include the public sector (Government ministries and departments); Academic institutions (universities/colleges/national or regional centers); and space agencies and private sector companies. These sectors are intertwined and fundamental for creating an enabling environment for solutions to a broad spectrum of pressing priorities: job creation, poverty alleviation, and sustainable resource management. The result shows that there is an uptake in the number of institutions and market segments created. To date, there are more than 90 academic institutions and over 53 national space agencies in 28 countries. Within the 53 national space agencies, 11 African countries have already launched a total of 36 satellites into orbit, and additional five are expected by the first quarter of 2021; another five by 2025; thus, amounting to 46 satellites not foreseen ten years ago. In addition, there are now ten receiving and tracking stations in six African countries and 17 scientific National Associations or Societies with specialized expertise in Geo-Information technologies. The updated survey on the private sector in 2019 ascertained that around 4110 people are working in 130 of the 229 EO and Geo-Information Science companies identified in Africa. Ongoing investigations reiterate that companies dealing with space-based datasets and Geo-Information Sciences together with the private spin-off companies today absorb more than 15,000 people and the assumption is that this number is going to exceed 100,000 by the year 2025.",Geo-Spatial Information Science,2020.0,26,"{'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10095020.2020.1730711?needAccess=true', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/10095020.2020.1730711?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2020.1730711, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

939f815fa5fb4e439e6c9ac8dcbb3393909b9d1f,Predicting citation impact from altmetric attention in clinical and translational research: Do big splashes lead to ripple effects?,"Publications are commonly used to evaluate the productivity and impact of research programs. Traditional metrics examine publication impact through slowly accumulating academic citations. “Altmetrics” are a new way to describe early publication influence in nonacademic media/community spheres (news, tweets, and blogs). Articles with significant altmetric attention make a big splash of immediate impact, whereas papers with high rates of academic citation reflect ripple effects of influence over time. Past research has found weak associations between altmetrics and academic citations. However, no previous research has focused on clinical/translational research, which aims to translate scientific discoveries to public use. Further, no previous research has assessed the relationship between altmetrics and modern citation impact factors like the National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s Relative Citation Ratio (RCR). It is also unclear whether publication in journals with higher journal impact factors (JIFs) may drive both public attention and academic impact. We investigated whether early altmetric indicators of splash predict citation ripples, beyond the effect of the JIF. For a portfolio of 2188 publications supported by the NIH’s Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance from 2007–2020, we collected 2020 Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS), 2020 JIFs, and 2021 RCRs. All three were significantly correlated with one another. Regression analyses revealed that AAS significantly predicts later RCR, controlling for JIF and publication year. Findings indicate that in clinical/translational science, articles that make a big splash of altmetric attention have ripple effects through increased citation influence, which is not entirely due to publication in higher impact journals. Altmetric attention may be a useful early indicator of eventual influence and potential for translational advancement.",Clinical and Translational Science,2022.0,9,"{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/cts.13251', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9199871, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Mathematics learning in schools has two goals, namely (1) the formation of students' characters who are logical, critical, rational, careful, effective and efficient and (2) the implementation of the results in everyday life and the development of science. According to the author's observations as a mathematics teacher at this junior high school, most of the eighth grade students cannot solve story problems correctly. In addition, the administration of exams, whether in the form of a national competency assessment or school exams using multiple choice questions, can stimulate students to complete with shortcuts. This causes students to find it increasingly difficult to work on story questions that are challenging and require higher thinking. To improve students' skills in solving story problems, it is necessary to emphasize the use of procedural steps as recommended by George Polya, namely understanding the problem, compiling a settlement plan, implementing a settlement plan and checking the results obtained. This research was carried out in two cycles. In the first cycle, it was found that the students' skills in solving the story problems of the Two Variable Linear Equation System were not maximized. The percentage of skills reaches 45% and completeness of learning reaches 40%. In the second cycle after reflection and improvement, the percentage of skills obtained is 75% while learning completeness reaches 76%. Thus, students' skills increased by 30% and learning completeness increased by 36%. From this study, it was concluded that through the use of the Polya step, the skills of class VIII C students of SMP Negeri 02 Rumbia in the 2020/2021 academic year in solving story problems of a two-variable linear equation system could be improved. Finally, the author suggests the VIII grade math teacher at SMP Negeri 02 Rumbia to be able to use Polya's steps in learning related to story problems so that students can solve problems systematically.
ABSTRAKPembelajaran efektif adalah pembelajaran yang mampu mengubah perilaku peserta didik yang meliputi pengetahuan, penalaran, kecakapan dan kebiasaan. Pembelajaran matematika di sekolah mengemban tercapainya dua sasaran yaitu (1) terbentuknya karakter peserta didik yang logis, kritis, rasional, cermat, efektif dan efisien dan (2) implementasi hasil dalam kehidupan sehari- hari dan pengembangan ilmu pengetahuan. Menurut pengamatan penulis sebagai guru matematika di SMP ini, sebagian besar siswa kelas VIII tidak dapat menyelesaikan soal cerita dengan benar. Di samping itu penyelenggaraan ujian baik itu berupa Asessmen kompetensi nasional maupun ujian sekolah yang menggunakan soal pilihan ganda dapat merangsang siswa untuk menyelesaikan dengan jalan pintas. Hal ini menyebabkan siswa semakin sulit mengerjakan soal-soal cerita yang menantang dan menuntut pemikiran lebih tinggi. Untuk meningkatkan keterampilan siswa dalam menyelesaikan soal cerita perlu ditekankan penggunaan langkah prosedural sebagaimana dianjurkan oleh George Polya yaitu memahami masalah, menyusun rencana penyelesaian, melaksanakan rencana penyelesaian dan memeriksa hasil yang diperoleh. Penelitian ini terlaksana dalam dua siklus. Pada siklus I diperoleh hasil bahwa keterampilan siswa dalam menyelesaikan soal cerita Sistem Persamaan Linear Dua Variabel belum maksimal. Persentase keterampilan mencapai 45% dan ketuntasan belajar mencapai 40%. Pada siklus II setelah dilakukan refleksi dan pembenahan, diperoleh hasil persentase keterampilan sebesar 75% sedangkan ketuntasan belajar mencapai 76%. Dengan demikian keterampilan siswa meningkat 30% dan ketuntasan belajar meningkat 36%. Dari penelitian ini diperoleh simpulan bahwa melalui penggunaan langkah Polya, keterampilan siswa kelas VIII C SMP Negeri 02 Rumbia Tahun Pelajaran 2020/2021 dalam menyelesaikan soal cerita sistem persamaan linear dua variabel dapat ditingkatkan. Akhirnya penulis menyarankan kepada guru matematika kelas VIII SMP Negeri 02 Rumbia untuk dapat menggunakan langkah Polya dalam pembelajaran berkaitan dengan soal cerita sehingga siswa dapat menyelesikan soal secara sistematis.",SCIENCE : Jurnal Inovasi Pendidikan Matematika dan IPA,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://jurnalp4i.com/index.php/science/article/download/916/929', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.51878/science.v2i1.916?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.51878/science.v2i1.916, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5f84d4c423edced3ed01aacd0c1fde64e6ec78fb,The Junior Americanist Workshop Series,"DOI:10.1017/S104909652200021X Like all modern innovations in political science, the Junior AmericanistWorkshop Series (JAWS) originated from aTwitter thread. When one of our cadre mused about whether zero-cost virtual seminars could fill the void left by themany in-person conferences andworkshops canceled or converted to costly remote formats due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we came together to answer the call (McCrain 2020). The founding vision of JAWS was to provide cost-free opportunities for early-career American politics scholars to present their research and receive feedback from leading scholars in their field.1 JAWS has evolved and currently provides free networking and professional-development opportunities, which many scholars had lost access to during the pandemic when conferences were curtailed and university buildings were closed. This article discusses how we developed JAWS, the challenges that we faced, and how we envision the workshop continuing as a complement to traditional in-person conferences in the postpandemic world. We began soliciting submissions for JAWS in August 2020 via Twitter, political science listservs (e.g., POLMETH and RACE POL), and our informal networks, which generated significant interest among potential presenters. We also invited several people, including senior scholars (i.e., tenured faculty), to volunteer as discussants, attend our sessions, and join our email list. When the number of submissions quickly surpassed 50, we promptly doubled the number of planned sessions by moving from once to twice a month to accommodate more presenters. During the 2020–2021 academic year, we held a total of 12 research workshops with 38 presenters that attracted a total of 632 attendees. Our Fall 2020 workshops included four presentations in two hours; in Spring 2021, we moved to two presentations in 90 minutes to allow for more engagement with each presentation. Discussants were responsible for only one paper, which made the commitment manageable for those who agreed to volunteer in that role. We also encouraged presenters to submit their papers at least one week before their session for posting them on our website so attendees could read them in advance. We made these decisions in service of our goal to provide presenters with quality feedback to which they otherwise might not have access. Overall, we successfully attracted a wide range of early-career academics to submit their work: approximately 40% of presenters were graduate students, 24% held non-tenure-track positions, and 36% were tenure-track assistant professors. We also succeeded in securing experienced discussants for our presenters: all of our discussants held PhDs and 47% were senior faculty (i.e., tenured). Although we were successful in recruiting presentations from early-career researchers, we had mixed success in ensuring diversity by gender, race, and institution type among our presenters. Fostering a diverse slate of presenters was a priority because scholars from underrepresented groups (e.g., women and people of color) and from institutions without ample financial support for faculty research (i.e., non-R1 departments) typically are perceived as lacking the very network connections that in-person conferences help to establish. Compared to the demographic characteristics of APSA members in the American politics subfield (as of February 2020), our slate of presenters included a larger percentage of women (47.3% versus 35.5%) and only a slightly smaller percentage of people of color (15.8% versus 20.7%), which suggests that we performed reasonably well in cultivating diversity by gender and race (American Political Science Association 2021). However, we performed less well in attaining institutional diversity because only 10.5% of our presenters were affiliated with non-R1 departments. This is partially an artifact of our focus on graduate students, who come predominantly from R1 universities; moving forward, we plan to account more consciously for levels of institutional support when we solicit submissions and choose presenters. This will be particularly important in the near future because those scholars with substantial institutional support (e.g., conference and travel funding) will be better advantaged by the return of traditional conference formats. In addition to our workshop series, we created a professionaldevelopment series with the goal of helping junior scholars to network and socialize in the profession. In the Spring 2021 semester, we hosted three hour-long events that brought together panelists with expertise on specific aspects of the discipline and more broadly on academia that may seem opaque to early-career scholars. Our panel topics included public scholarship, academicbook publishing, and academic-journal publishing. When we promoted these events, we broadened our outreach by emphasizing that they would be beneficial for all junior scholars rather than specifically those who study American politics. These sessions attracted 186 total attendees, and we will continue holding professional development panels in the future. A major challenge for those who want to organize virtual conferences andworkshops ismimicking the informal networking and discussion opportunities traditionally available at in-person conferences. One way that we facilitated networking was to host virtual trivia events on the same evenings as several of our JAWS panels.2 Although attendance was smaller at these events than at the panels, we still attracted 80 total attendees who convened on Zoom and received positive feedback from attendees. We are actively considering other virtual networking opportunities for the coming year, including the use of Gather (2021), and we also held a JAWS happy hour at the 2021 APSA Annual Meeting with great turnout. Although it is difficult to replicate in a virtual format the space for networking that in-person conferences afford, our goal is",PS: Political Science & Politics,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1017/S104909652200021X?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1017/S104909652200021X, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

50eba7cc4abf721ab0b945a644ac5ee7880fc3d4,Changing of the guard,"At the ICCB in Montpelier (2015) I met with the Society for Conservation Biology (SCB) elected officials, journal editors, and everyone I could on an idea that had been haunting me. I felt that the SCB was missing an important opportunity to serve the community of conservation scholars. My rationale was simple: SCB was precluding the bulk of conservation science by holding to the standard of seeking to publish papers that transcend individual species or geographies. Further, the obsession with novelty left little opportunity to replicate studies and build the evidence base needed for conservation practice. We needed to add journal space for the majority of conservation science. The SCB's mission includes supporting a growing international community in conservation science. This community includes both researchers and practitioners. With the existing journals, SCB was thinking globally, but not acting locally. By failing to publish research of primarily local interest, SCB was falling short in helping build needed bridges between scholarship and practice. To increase Society impact, I argued, we needed to provide journal space where our global community of students, practitioners, and researchers could publish work showing how they applied existing tools to specific conservation targets in specific locations. My argument received strong support from both SCB and Wiley, our publishing partner, at every step of the process. Nevertheless, it took over 3 years, and countless meetings, to actually launch Conservation Science and Practice (CSP) in 2019. After working to establish the journal through the SCB publications committee, I had the honor to be selected as the inaugural Editor-in-Chief. Happily, CSP has exceeded expectations in every single metric of success that SCB and Wiley set through its first 3 years. Beginning with just 16 Associate Editors (AEs), CSP has grown to three Senior Associate Editors, over 60 AEs. Submissions have increased significantly each year. With CSP, SCB demonstrated that there is room for journals willing to publish local, practiceoriented conservation research. The outpouring of support from our community of scholarship endorsing the need for a journal that seeks to engage practitioners has been astounding and, personally, touching. To make progress on the biodiversity crisis, we need an army of researcher–practitioner partnerships working on the thousands of conservation challenges facing the globe. We need even more journal space to foster growth in this knowledge base, and other journals such as Ecological Solutions and Evidence are entering this space. I am proud of our CSP accomplishments in these early years. Midway through 2022, CSP has published approximately the same number of papers (194) as Conservation Biology and Conservation Letters combined (203), making it our largest Society journal. With a 3.57 (2021) Impact Factor, CSP has, in my opinion, hit the sweet spot. We want CSP to publish papers that are cited; be a journal of high repute. But we also want to be able to publish the specific outcomes of specific projects in specific locations. That means not striving to maximize our Impact Factor. Solid science is our model, and it is working. Hitting this mark has been a journey. Reviewers can mistake CSP for a journal that is striving toward the relentless focus on novelty, as opposed to a journal where scientists and practitioners focus on conservation outcomes obtained using our existing conservation toolkit. I am perhaps proudest to have been part of launching two unusual paper formats. Our Innovations in Practice (beginning in 2019 as “Evidence” and renamed in 2021) papers (e.g., Dube and Kavho 2022; Kusmanoff et al. 2022) provide a venue for practitioners to report on outcomes of programs and actions in a much less formal way than the typical contributed paper. In 2022, we added a second unusual paper type, Scientific Impact Papers (500 words). Since we hope that the work we publish has an impact on the ground, we have invited authors to report when scholarship leads to action. Through these two paper types, we hope to further contribute to the evidence base for conservation practitioners.

fa54d6faf63a237583f336ca2de800ad5380b536,THIS IS THE THIRD ISSUE DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF DISTINGUISHED SCIENTIST ALFRED KRONER WHO SADLY PASSED AWAY ON 22 MAY 2019,"It is now over eleven years' ago, in November 2010, that the American Journal of Science published the first of two volumes marking the 70 birthday of Alfred Kroner. We, his friends and colleagues, planned to mark Alfred's 80 birthday with another special issue of the American Journal of Science, designed to showcase the scientific advances that had been made over the past decade in those areas of geoscientific endeavor that were closest to Alfred's heart. Sadly, Alfred passed away on 22 May 2019, less than four months before his 80 birthday (8 September). This is the third and final volume compiled to celebrate his tremendous contribution to geoscientific research. In the Preface to American Journal of Science, volume 310, number 9 of November 2010, a comprehensive outline of Alfred's career up until that date was presented (kindly outlined and supplemented by Alfred) and the reader is referred to this for more details of his earlier career. In the Preface to the first of these special issues (volume 321, numbers 1,2 of January-February 2021), we focused on the last ten years, outlining Alfred's major contributions, where his work was principally focused, and the key activities he undertook. We include this information below: Alfred's long association with Prof Liu Dunyi and the Beijing SHRIMP Center continued throughout the last decade of his life and resulted in a fruitful cooperation that was especially beneficial to young Chinese geoscientists. Alfred would spend several months every year based at the SHRIMP Laboratory, although he made many journeys both within China to deliver invited lectures and short courses at numerous institutions and universities, as well as undertaking many fieldtrips both in China and neighboring countries. In particular, his work on the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) was ongoing in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. As Chairman of the International Precambrian Research Center of China (IPRCC), Alfred also organized a series of lectures, workshops and fieldtrips every year; many designed principally for students. The first of these was in May 2010, when the field workshop “Early Crustal Evolution of the SE Kaapvaal Craton in South Africa and Swaziland” was organized and attended by a large contingent from China. In October that year, the 5 SHRIMP Workshop and a workshop on “Advances in high-resolution SIMS and LA-ICP-MS Geochronology and Application to Geological Processes” were held in Beijing and Alfred took an active part in their organization. These were followed by a field excursion to Inner Mongolia to investigate Paleoproterozoic ultra-high temperature rocks of the Khondalite Belt. Also organized during this period was a training course in zircon geochronology including SHRIMP analytical techniques, which was run for the benefit of higher degree students from universities and institutions all over China. This course was presented by Ian Williams, Robert Pidgeon, Lutz Nasdala, William Griffin, Fernando Corfu, Klaus Mezger, M Santosh and Yusheng Wan. In April 2011, there was the “Lithospheric Evolution through Time” workshop in Beijing presented by Alfred Kroner, Walter Mooney and Ron Clowes, and in October 2012 a training course on “Migmatites, Melting and Intracrustal Differentiation”, followed by a fieldtrip for the students held at Taishan in Shandong Province, both run by Michael Brown, Edward Sawyer, Richard White and Simon Wilde.",American Journal of Science,2022.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2475/02.2022.11?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2475/02.2022.11, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3831f0ac29761776dee0b9b0b9d1670a3e46dc6a,The fall of the Murchison meteorite,"The year 1969 was an awesome one for cosmochemists. Scientists worldwide were gearing up for the return of the first lunar samples, courtesy of the Apollo 11 astronauts, on July 24. NASA had arranged for teams of scientists to collaborate on the initial characterization of the samples, and there were well-characterized standard samples making the rounds of state-of-the-art analytical laboratories—in some cases newly established for the occasion. On February 8 of that year, the Allende carbonaceous chondrite had fallen. At over 2000 kg of recovered samples, this is still the largest carbonaceous chondrite fall known (see McCoy and Corrigan 2020). This provided scientists with the opportunity to test and refine analytical capabilities being prepared for the Apollo samples, and at the same time opened a new window into the early solar system. In December 1969, Japanese scientists would serendipitously discover the first nine Yamato meteorites, which led to a revolution in the recovery of meteorite falls (see Yamaguchi et al. 2020). On September 28, the fall of the Murchison meteorite added icing to the cake. At 10:58 AM local time, explosions announced the entry of this visitor to Victoria, Australia, on that clear morning. The best summaries of the fall are given by Seargent (1990) and Lock (2019). A sonic boom rattled windows and shook houses, as a bright fireball was observed to explode into multiple large fragments (reports of the number vary) and a shower of stones fell extending from the villages of Wahring and Murchison East, across Murchison Township, and on toward the nearby Waranga Basin (a lake), a westerly oriented direction. Witnesses reported that the fireball was bright orange, and left a trail of white to black smoke, which persisted for at least 2 min. The meteorite strewn field measured at least 11 9 3 km—the exact size is not well known because field searches were somewhat limited by fears of encounters with deadly tiger snakes (Gillick, personal communication). At first, the fireball and explosion were taken by some to be a distressed airplane. Many ground observers noted a methylated spirits–like smell. The first stones were recovered later that morning at Brisbane’s Dairy, one of which had smashed into and dented a steel fence. A 650 g stone was later found to have penetrated a corrugated iron roof 2 km from the dairy. No humans or animals are known to have been injured by falling stones, but some dogs and cows were reported to have run for shelter. Locals and visitors collected samples for months, well into 1970. Of course, samples collected after rain were relatively degraded. Searches as late as the 1990s still produced recognizable meteorites. Ultimately over 100 kg of stones was recovered, but this must have been a small fraction of the total fallen mass (again—snakes; Fig. 1). Most of the samples are currently held at the Field Museum (Chicago, ~50 kg) and at the National Museum of Natural History (Washington, ~20 kg; Grady 2000). Only a few kilograms remain in museums in Victoria. The exceptional total mass of sample available for lab study has made Murchison a gold mine for astromineralogists and cosmochemists studying the formation of primitive small solar system bodies, the origin and evolution of water and organics in the early solar system, and astrobiology. Murchison joins Allende as touchstones for every new analytical instrument brought to bear on primitive meteorites. When someone needs large masses of a hydrous or carbonaceous chondrite to make amino acid measurements, or bulk isotopic or trace element measurements, or shock impact experiments, they always turn to Murchison. It is one of the most repeatedly brutalized astromaterials we have. Fortunately, a large total mass of samples remain for future brutalization.

d02173cd3ba113702448bf029505d6ead51f68aa,The Secret Sauce: Examining Law Schools that Overperform on the Bar Exam,"Since 2010, law schools have faced declining enrollment and entering classes with lower predictors of success despite recent signs of improvement. At least partly as a result, rates at which law school graduates pass the bar exam have declined and remain at historic lows. Yet, during this time, many schools have improved their graduates’ chances of success on the bar exam, and some schools have dramatically outperformed their predicted bar exam passage rates. This Article examines which schools do so and why. Research for this Article began by accounting for law schools’ incoming class credentials to predict an expected bar exam passage rate for each ABA-accredited law school. This Article then examines each law school’s aggregated performance on bar exams for which its graduates sat based on relative and absolute performance, weighing the difficulty of each state’s bar exam. Through this analysis, this Article identifies law schools with consistently higher and lower first-time bar exam passage rates over a period of six years between 2014 and 2019. In addition to identifying law schools that overperform on the bar exam, this Article is a novel contribution not only to the legal education literature but also to the quantitative methodological literature, given its unique tailoring of the classic value-added modeling design to the realities of the bar exam. In the second phase of research for this Article, the authors surveyed administrators at these overperforming and underperforming law schools, as well as law schools in the middle of the distribution, to qualitatively assess how these law schools approach the bar success of their students. Collectively, this Article provides significant insight into how law schools are responding to recent negative trends in bar passage rates, validates successful approaches to mitigate these negative trends, and * CJ Ryan is an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law and an Affiliated Scholar with the American Bar Foundation.

See William Vogeler, Study Blames Law Students Not Law Schools for Low Bar Pass Rates, FINDLAW (Apr. 22, 2019, 12:01 PM), https://blogs.findlaw.com/greedy_associates/2019/04/study-blames-law-students--not-law-schools---for-low-bar-pass-rates.html [https://perma.cc/B7C3-6NSA] (citing a study by the ABA noting that law student credentials have declined nationally over the last few years). And many law schools have considered a variety of curricular changes, only occasionally with empirical support. See Louis N. Schulze, The Science of Learning Law: Academic Support Measures at Florida International University College of Law, 88 BAR EXAM’R, Summer 2019, at 2, 9, 11; Mario W. Mainero, We Should Not Rely on Commercial Bar Reviews to Do Our Job: Why Labor-Intensive Comprehensive Bar Examination Preparation Can and Should Be a Part of the Law School Mission, 19 CHAPMAN L. REV. 545, 554–55, 596 (2016). 2. Of course, the decision by a student to attend law school is multifactorial. There is a robust literature on student choice in the undergraduate context of the higher education sector. See generally, e.g., Robert K. Toutkoushian, Do Parental Income and Educational Attainment Affect the Initial Choices of New Hampshire’s College-Bound Students?, 20 ECON. EDUC. REV. 245 (2001); Laura Walter Perna, Differences in the Decision to Attend College among African Americans, Hispanics, and Whites, 71 J. HIGHER EDUC. 117 (2000); Stephen L. DesJardins et al., Modeling the College Application Decision Process in a Land-Grant University, 18 ECON. EDUC. REV. 117 (1999); James C. Hearn, Determinants of Postsecondary Education Attendance: Some Implications of Alternative Specifications of Enrollment, 10 EDUC. EVALUATION & POL’Y ANALYSIS 171 (1988). Yet, there is little scholarly attention to student choice in the graduate education context and legal education in particular. Two recent and contemporaneous studies shed light on the factors that prospective students considered in deciding whether to attend law school and the factors that influenced their decisions. In both studies, bar exam success was a factor in most students’ decision to attend law school. However, the extent to which the bar passage rate of a given law school was an important factor in a student’s decision to attend law school varied with the student’s credentials on entry.

In 2011, Addiction Science & Clinical Practice (ASCP) Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Samet (with the late Editor Emeritus Richard Saitz) took the reins of our journal from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to usher it into a new era as an open-access forum for clinically relevant research and perspectives that contribute to improving the quality of care (prevention and treatment) for people with unhealthy alcohol, tobacco, or other drug use and addictive behaviors across a spectrum of settings. Now, as we begin our 11th year, we can look back at our accomplishments over the last decade: we have published 766 articles (44% from outside the US, 26% from Europe); produced 5 thematic series, 1 special issue, and 10 supplements; and forged lasting partnerships with the International Network on Brief Interventions for Alcohol and Drugs (INEBRIA) and the Addictions Health Services Research (AHSR) Conference. ASCP has been cited 7277 times with a yearly average 12% increase that jumped to 28% in the last year. Notably in 2020, we received a firsttime Journal Impact Factor of 3.088, 7th of 20 addiction journals (it has since climbed to 3.544 in 2021). We are proud of these accomplishments and grateful to our team of outstanding associate editors, our editorial board and managing editor, our contributors, and all of you who contribute your time to review articles for us. The work of our ASCP community has never been more relevant. Though addiction is a consistent and ubiquitous threat to public health across cultures and societies globally, roughly over the same period as our journal was gaining momentum, substance use reached an all-time high. The US opioid overdose crisis hit peak levels of deaths and increasingly became characterized by polysubstance use with particularly large increases in methamphetamine use among people who use opioids [1]. Overdose deaths from cocaine and methamphetamine increased 3and 13-fold, respectively [2, 3]. Unhealthy alcohol use increased substantially, particularly in women; alcohol-related deaths doubled between 1999 and 2017 and served as a major contributor to the decline in overall US life expectancy observed between 2015 and 2017 [4]. Though tobacco use has declined overall worldwide, use has increased among men; 45% of adults in South East Asia use tobacco [5], and vaping among youth increased ~ 75% between 2017 and 2018 with greater increases expected annually [6]. Finally, both medical and recreational cannabis use have become increasingly legal and accessible, creating a need for studies about its epidemiology and treatment, particularly its longitudinal health impacts [7]. This time was also marked by new funding mechanisms and multiple innovative and rigorous efforts to implement evidence-based care for substance use in medical settings [8–11] and innovative clinical trials [12–14] the results of which have informed clinical guidelines [15] and ongoing conversations about best practices [16–18]. Despite these innovations, the majority of persons with unhealthy substance use, substance use disorders, and/or other addictive disorders do not receive evidence-based care [19, 20].

9fc59c8177034d4c870a0a9f98a00493b928ea72,A bearer of good news.,"“Summer is on its way and my partner and I managed to grow this rose which has a wonderful scent.” A picture of a beautiful orange flower accompanied the note—part of a weekly email sharing good news with the members of our research center. One year ago, an announcement like this could have seemed insignificant and irrelevant to the important work of science. But amid the difficulties of 2020, it was anything but. It put a smile on my face, and hopefully it did the same for my colleagues. It helped build human connection. And it reminded us that, even this year, good things happened.



> “Highlighting the positive moments … helped keep our spirits up.” 

Last year, the director of the research center in Australia where I serve as the business strategy manager asked me to help maintain a positive, productive culture. Back then, I didn't anticipate that the task was going to be so difficult. Then, of course, came 2020.

During the first half of the year, Australia experienced an extreme drought followed by devastating bushfires and heavy rainfall that brought massive flooding. Next came the pandemic. With people not coming in to the lab or staying only long enough to conduct their experiments, we lost our sense of interpersonal connection. Then, in July, our director shared that she had been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer.

In the wake of that devastating announcement, one of the center's group leaders suggested we send our director weekly good news to keep her informed and to try to lift her spirits. One week later, we sent the first email. The rule was that no good news was too small to share. We reported the arrival of much-needed new computers for one lab, one of our group leaders being contacted by a journalist for their expert opinion on viruses in the context of the pandemic, a student submitting their thesis, a paper being published, and a group leader securing child care spots for their children.

The effect of this simple newsletter—which went to all the group leaders as well as our director—was profound. Many people responded, saying they enjoyed this informal venue for learning about their colleagues' successes. The flood of negative news had kept us from noticing the good things that were happening. Highlighting the positive moments didn't mean we were ignoring the larger catastrophes, but it helped keep our spirits up. I also realized that, prior to the newsletter, some group members didn't know about others' successes. Sharing these updates more publicly gave everyone a boost. After a few weeks, we decided to broaden the recipient list to include everyone at the center.

These days, we solicit good news every Wednesday and send out an email every Friday. The process and format are simple and no-frills, making the newsletter sustainable. At first I worried that people might be hesitant to share updates that seemed too insignificant, but the opposite has been true; they have been eager to highlight their endeavors and successes, big and small, professional and personal. Good news we've shared includes securing grants and fellowships, publishing papers, becoming parents, turning 40, and—of course—growing roses on one's balcony. “I love good news time,” a colleague wrote after a recent email. “It really is uplifting.”

Last month, one group leader's good news was that, after breaking his arm, he finally had his cast removed. The next week, he reported that his daughter broke her arm and offered the tongue-in-cheek hypothesis that the number of broken bones in his family is a conserved quantity. It wasn't exactly good news, but the joke made me chuckle. Equally important, it's personal news, and sharing it helps us stay connected in these difficult times.

With 2020 drawing to a close, we can hope for better things in 2021. But regardless of what the future holds, we plan to continue to share our good news.",Science,2020.0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.370.6523.1522?download=true', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1126/science.370.6523.1522?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1126/science.370.6523.1522, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f0c9ea918cfa9e28a660fd6c4a513203878b2a32,"Prediction of Energy Consumption and Structure in Hebei Province Based on GM (1,1) Model","With the rapid development of economy, energy demand is increasing in Hebei. Therefore, prediction of energy consumption and structure in Hebei province has importance of actual meaning significance. In this paper, total energy, coal, oil and natural gas consumption data are selected in Hebei province between 2001 and 2013. First, energy consumption and structure in Hebei province are analyzed. Second, GM(1,1)forecast model is established. Then, according to the established forecast model, energy consumption and structure between 2014 and 2021 in Hebei province is predicted. Last, related suggestions on energy optimization are put forward. The results are expected to provide important scientific basis for energy utilization and planning in Hebei province. Introduction Grey prediction is a method that can predict the systems containing uncertainties. To find the laws of system changes, original data is generating processed by identifying development trend of dissimilarity degree between system factors. Thus, data sequence with high regularity is generated. And then the corresponding differential equation model is established to predict future development trend of things. GM (1,1) prediction model with a variable and first-order differential is an important model of grey prediction. It is commonly used in energy and environment prediction because this model requires less modeling information, operates easily, forecasts precisely and is easy to test. In this paper, total energy, coal, oil and natural gas consumption data in Hebei province between 2001 and 2013 are selected as original sequence. GM (1, 1) model is constructed to predict energy consumption and structure in following 20 years in Hebei province. It hopes to provide reference and scientific basis for energy development strategy and the establishment of energy planning in Hebei. Analysis of energy consumption and structure in Hebei province The energy data in Hebei province between 2000 and 2012 are from China energy statistical yearbook. In this paper, all the energy consumption data have been converted into standard coal and the unit is ten thousand tons of standard coal. Table one shows the energy consumption and consumption structure in Hebei province. As shown in table 1, the total energy consumption in Hebei province seems to be increasing annually from 2000 to 2012 and its average annual growth rate is 7.95%. However, the speed of total energy consumption growth is different during the period and it has periodic growth characteristic. From the table, we can see that the growth speed is rapid from 2001 to 2007. Energy consumption structure in Hebei province is basically stable in recent years because of restriction on resources endowment and consumption structure of energy relying mainly on coal cannot be changed. Coal accounts for about 90 percent in energy consumption before 2011, but oil, gas and electricity such clean energy consumption occupies 10 percent of the total energy consumption. This shows that there is no variety in energy consumption structure in Hebei province and energy consumption has many defects. It depends heavily on coal which is non-renewable International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (ICCSE 2015) © 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 34 energy, so the renewable clean energy strengthened the large market demand, and the development of solar energy utilization technology has a broad prospect.

(2009) proposed ‘Planetary Boundaries’ which is a concept involving Earth system processes that contain environmental boundaries. In the framework, nitrogen (N) cycle, rate of biodiversity loss and climate change have been transgressed by humanity already. In 2015, the United Nations (UN) established the global agenda for sustainable development until 2030 and defined it as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including 17 specified goals with 169 targets. Many goals were related to land use and management changes (LUMC) with carbon (C) and N dynamics among atmospherebiosphere-pedosphere systems with agricultural activities, such as Zero Hunger (Goal 2), Climate Action (Goal 13), Life on Land (Goal 13) and so on (https://www.undp.org/sustainabledevelopment-goals). Soils could be C sinks or sources depending on climate, land use and management changes (CLUMC) in different plant-soil ecosystems. Soil N and its dynamics not only affect plant growth and crop production but also control soil C sequestration. Thus, C and N dynamics affected by CLUMC in terrestrial ecosystems contribute not only to global and local environmental problems, including global warming, destruction of the ozone layer, acid rain, and eutrophication, but also to changes in soil fertility and crop production related to human sustainable development (Cheng 2020). Many of our colleagues around the world are studying the C and N dynamics by CLUMC in different regions and countries with various ecosystems. We need to share our knowledge and learn from each other researches and discuss how to do the next studies for the UN-SDGs. Therefore, we have held the ‘International Symposium on C and N Dynamics by Land Use and Management Changes in East and Southeast Asian Countries’ on September 10–12, 2018 in Tsuruoka campus, Yamagata University, Japan, and published a special section in Soil Science and Plant Nutrition (SSPN) titled as ‘Soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics by land use and management changes in East and Southeast Asian countries (Soil C and N by LUMC).’ There were 20 papers in the special section, including 4 review papers and 16 original articles (Cheng 2020). Many papers in the special section have been cited many times during the last 2 years. Two years late, we planed the second international symposium for similar topics on September 28–30, 2020 in Tsuruoka, Japan again. Since the outbreaks of COVID-19 pandemic around the world from January 2020, we could not invite and receive guests from foreign countries. Therefore, we decided to hold an International Online Symposium (IOS) on Soil C and N Dynamics by Land Use, Management, and Climate Changes. In this virtual symposium, a total 56 of our colleagues in 14 countries around the world participated and presented their newest research results in this IOS (Figure 1). More than 80 young students in many universities have joined the IOS to learn the front knowledge in the world (Figure 2). The IOS also celebrated Professor Kazuyuki INUBUSHI will officially retire from Chiba University in March 2021 since many of his former students around the world joined the IOS together even during the COVID-19 pandemic period. As much of the research presented in the IOS is valuable, original, and has not been published yet, we organized a special section ‘Soil C and N response to climate, land-use and management changes (Soil C, N and CLUMC)’ in SSPN. In addition, we also collected original related papers from colleagues around the world who did not attend the symposium. Finally, we accepted 20 papers, including 2 review papers and 18 original articles, for publishing in this special section of Soil C, N and CLUMC. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities are causing climate change, including global warming. To slow climate change requires reducing these emissions. The government of many countries declared that they would realize carbon-neutrality (net-zero carbon emissions) by around 2050. Net-zero emissions will be achieved when all GHGs (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), etc.) emissions released by human activities are counterbalanced by removing GHGs from the atmosphere in a process known as carbon removal. Since the forests are a very important sink of atmospheric GHGs, we need to understand the real potentials of forests for mitigating climate change. In this special section, Sase et al. (2022) reviewed the reactive nitrogen (Nr) from the atmosphere by both domestic and transboundary air pollution and its dynamics in center Japan from their long-term investigation. The current atmospheric dissolved inorganic N is still high, at over 10 kg ha year, which implied the C sequestration and CH4 absorption and N2O emission should be affected by the Nr deposition. Xu (2022) reviewed the effect of freeze-thaw disturbance on soil C and N dynamics and GHG fluxes of East Asia forests according to the laboratory and field measurements.

Because of its chronic course, most of the individuals with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment which may pose financial, physical, and mental burden over the primary caregivers. So, while taking care of the individuals with schizophrenia over a prolonged period, caregivers themselves can suffer from the burden in the form of depression, anxiety, and stress. Objective: To study the relationship between caregiver burden in the form of depression, anxiety and stress, and the resilience among the primary caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia. Methodology: Present crosssectional study was carried out by the department of Psychiatry of a tertiary care rural teaching hospital from Maharashtra, India. Data were collected from 80 primary caregivers by using standard questionnaires like Depression, Anxiety and Stress – 21 item (DASS-21) scale to measure the caregiver burden and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) to measure the levels of resilience. Results: Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress were 55%, 35%, and 48.7% respectively. Significant negative correlation was observed between resilience levels and depression (r= -0.23), anxiety (r= -0.35), and stress (r= -0.24), suggesting that the probability of the caregiver burden increases with decline in the level of resilience. Conclusion: Based on the findings, we recommend that regular individual as well as group sessions should be conducted for the primary caregivers to strengthen their resilience so that they can not only Medical Science pISSN 2321–7359; eISSN 2321–7367 To Cite: Shukla RS, Ghogare AS, Patil PS.

Effective learning one of which is influenced by the use of teaching materials. Preliminary investigation data at SMPN 25 Padang show that there is no teaching material in the form of an e-module that can visualize the subject matter as a whole. Based on the results of the questionnaire, it is known that 67.16% of students have difficulty understanding the concepts of the respiratory system and the excretory system. This causes the low learning outcomes for students, so teaching materials are needed that can assist in visualizing the subject matter as a whole. This study aims to produce an e-module based on problem based learning using adobe flash professional CS6 on the material of the human respiratory and excretory systems for students of class VIII that is valid, practical, and effective. This type of research is the Plomp model development research which consists of three phase, namely the initial preliminary research phase, the development or prototyping phase, and the assessment phase. The research subjects are students of class VIII SMPN 25 Padang Academic Year 2021-2022. The research data were obtained from validity, practicality, and effectiveness tests. The validity test data was obtained through a validation sheet by lecturers as validators. Practical test data was obtained from the results of the questionnaire response analysis of teachers and students. Effectiveness test data were obtained from multiple choice question sheets for assessing cognitive competence, observation sheets for assessing affective competence and psychomotor competence, and essay question sheets for assessing students creative thinking skills. The results of validation by validators on the e-module based on problem-based learning show an average value of 86.35% (very valid). The results of the practicality assessment by science teachers showed an average of 90.87% (very practical) and the results of the practicality assessment by students obtained an average value of 89.25% (very practical). The results of the effectiveness test from the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor aspects of students showed that the problem based learning based e-module was very effective and the value of creative thinking skills obtained an average of 74.24 (creative). Thus, it can be concluded that the problem based learning based e-module developed is very valid, very practical, very effective, and can train creative thinking skills.",International Journal of Current Science Research and Review,2022.0,0,"{'url': 'https://ijcsrr.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/16-08-2022.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47191/ijcsrr/v5-i8-16?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47191/ijcsrr/v5-i8-16, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6107c06d96abdbd68f5c99db276616fabfb5dc08,Preliminary Findings of Usability Studies on an Ontology-Aware Taxon-by-Character Matrix Editor,"Taxonomic treatments start with the creation of taxon-by-character matrices. Systematics authors recognized data ambiguity issues in published phenotypic characters and are willing to adopt an ontology-aware authoring tool (Cui et al. 2022). To promote interoperable and reusable taxonomic treatments, we have developed two research prototypes:
 
 
 
 a web-based application, Character Recorder (http://chrecorder.lusites.xyz/login), to faciliate the use and addition of ontology terms by Carex systematist authors while building their matrices, and
 
 
 a mobile application, Conflict Resolver (Android, https://tinyurl.com/5cfatrz8), to identify potential conflicts among the terms added by the authors and facilitate the resolution of the conflicts. We have completed two usability studies on Character Recorder.
 
 
 
 a web-based application, Character Recorder (http://chrecorder.lusites.xyz/login), to faciliate the use and addition of ontology terms by Carex systematist authors while building their matrices, and
 a mobile application, Conflict Resolver (Android, https://tinyurl.com/5cfatrz8), to identify potential conflicts among the terms added by the authors and facilitate the resolution of the conflicts. We have completed two usability studies on Character Recorder.
 In the one-hour Student Usabiilty Study, 16 third-year biology students with a general introduction to Carex used Character Recorder and Excel to record a set of 11 given characters for two samples (shape of sheath summits = U-shaped/U shaped). In the three-day Expert Usability Study, 7 established Carex systematists and 1 graduate student with expert-level knowledge used Character Recorder to record characters for 1 sample each of Carex canesens and Carex rostrata as they would in their professional life, using real mounted specimens, microscope, reticles, and rulers. Experts activities were not timed but they spent roughly 1.5 days on recording the characters and the rest of time discussing features and improvements. 
 Features of Character Recorder have been reported in 2021 TDWG meeting and we included here only a few figures to highlight its interoperability and reusability features at the time of the usability studies (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 3). The Carex Ontology accompanying Character Recorder was created by extracting terms from Carex treatments of Flora of China and Flora of North America using Explorer of Taxon Concept (Cui et al. 2016) with subsequent manual edits. The design principle of Character Recorder is to encourage standardization and also leave the authors the freedom to do their work.
 While it took students an average of 6 minutes to recover all the given characters using Microsoft® Excel®, as opposed to 11 minutes using Character Recorder, the total number of unique meaning-bearing words used in their characters was 116 with Excel versus 30 with Character Recorder, showing the power of the latter in reducing synonyms and spelling variations. All students reported that they learned to use Character Recorder quickly and some even thought their use was as fast or faster than using Excel. All preferred Character Recorder to Excel for teaching students to record character data. Nearly all of the students found Character Recorder was more useful for recording clear and consistent data and all students agreed that participating in this study raised their awareness of data variation issues. 
 The expert group consisted of 3, 2, 1, 3 experts in age ranges 20-49, 50-59, 60-69, and >69, respectively. They each recorded over 100 characters for two or more samples. Detailed analysis of their characters is pending, but we have noticed color characters have more variations than other characters (Fig. 4). All experts reported that they learned to use Character Recorder quickly, and 6 out of 8 believed they would not need a tutorial the next time they used it. One out of 8 experts somewhat disliked the feature of reusing others' values (""Use This"" in Fig. 2) as it may undermine the objectivity and independence of an author. All experts used Recommended Set of Characters and they liked the term suggestion and illustration features shown in Figs 2, 3. All experts would recommend that their colleagues try Character Recorder and recommended that it be further developed and integrated into every taxonomist's toolbox. 
 Student and expert responses to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX, Hart and Staveland 1988) are summarized in Fig. 5, which suggests that, while Character Recorder may incur in a slightly higher cost, the performance it supports outweighs its cost, especially for students. 
 Every piece of the software prototypes and associated resources are open for anyone to access or further develop. We thank all student and expert participants and US National Science Foundation for their support in this research.

3d913024d0e43ea8369c7497161b13a1f61e932b,Volvulus of Colon Sigmoide in the General Surgery Department of Chu Gabriel Toure,"Introduction: Sigmoid colon volvulus is a medico-surgical emergency which represents a common cause of colonic occlusion, it is characterized by strangulation of the sigmoid loop around its meso colic axis producing low mechanical occlusion [1]. Apart from this form conventionally described, the volvulus of the sigmoid colon can occur along an organoaxial axis. This form has been highlighted in the literature thanks to the diagnostic contribution of multi-detector scanners [2]. Objective: To determine the hospital frequency of sigmoid colon volvulus; to write the clinical and para-clinical aspects of sigmoid colon volvulus; write down the different treatments used for the management of sigmoid colon volvulus. Material and methods: This was a retrospective and prospective study that took place from January 2008 to December 2020 in the General Surgery Department of Gabriel Touré. The retrospective phase ran from January 2008 to December 2019 and the prospective phase from January 2020 to December 2020. Results: From January 2008 to December 2020, we collected 320 cases of patients operated on for sigmoid colon volvulus out of 7989 surgical emergencies over a 12-year period, or 3.64%. In our study, the most represented age group was between 16 and 60 years old, i.e. 81.88%. The mean age was 42.6 ± 17.4 years with extremities of 16 and 90 years. The male sex was the most represented, 89% with a sex ratio of 8.41. The surgical history was found in 13.75% of our patients. The clinic was dominated by abdominal pain (100%), meteorism (100%), and gas and matter arrest (91.3%). The most common radiological image found in the ASP was the double jamb, i.e. 74.69% of cases. We found sigmoid necrosis in 18.13% of cases. We found an absence of necrosis in the majority of cases, i.e. How to cite this paper: Amadou, M., Ibrahima, D., Amadou, B., Boubacar, D.A., Bathio, T., Diassana, M., Yoro, S.B., Tani, K., Adama, D.A., Amadou, T., Zakari, S., Mamadou, D., Moussa, K., Hélène, S.O., Lassana, K., Madiassa, K., Souleymane, D., Moussa, S., Tientigui, D.B., Alhassane, T. and Adégné, T.

343e7d95d19421b84f2dfa598b66d318fd2409c0,Nutraceuticals: New perspective and approach to prevent dysmenorrhea,"

The term ""nutraceutical"" is derived from the words ""nutrition"" and ""pharmaceutical."" Nutraceuticals, in general, are foods or components of foods that have a significant role in influencing and maintaining optimal physiological function in humans. The nutraceutical market's worldwide expansion is being driven by current demographic and health trends. The first step toward achieving proper control and avoiding mensuration issues is nutritional medical therapy. Moderate weight reduction (7%), taking a proper diet as well as 150 minutes of physical exercise each week are among the lifestyle improvements. There are a variety of pharmacological therapies available for primary dysmenorrhea, but they all have negative effects. Poor food and lifestyle, on the other hand, cause micronutrient deficiencies in women, which play a crucial role in menstrual cycle problems. In this study, the effects of micronutrients and dietary supplements on the level of pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea are looked at.



The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of dietary and nutritional supplements with special emphasis on dysmenorrhea. This paper is about understanding and making sense of the details of menstrual pain and how a healthy diet can be used as a treatment to ease or stop menstrual pain.



Selection of data has been done by studying a combination of various research and review paper from different database like PubMed, NCBI, Various guidelines of obstetricians and gynecologists, and Web of Science from the year 1942-2021 by using keywords like "" pain"", ""mensuration"", ‘role of calcium in dysmenorrhea’, ""dietary supplement for dysmenorrhea"", ""role of magnesium in menstrual cramps"", ""nutritional requirement for treatment of dysmenorrhea"", ""soft tissue pain"", ""mensuration problems"", "" menstrual cramps"", ""effective treatment for dysmenorrhea"", ""herbal treatment for menstrual pain"", role of conventional treatment during menstruation pain"", ""effect of herbal treatment on menstrual pain"", ""self-care strategies for dysmenorrhea "", "" types of pain"", ""different therapy used to cure menstrual pain"".



Based on various papers and literature reviews, we have reached conclusions about various dietary supplements and herbs that can be used to avoid pain during menstruation, as well as their all-day nutritional requirements for different age groups and treatment efficacy.



According to current evidence, young women should be instructed in the proper use of dietary supplements, nutrition, and vitamins, as well as the inclusion of effective diet and lifestyle changes such as exercise and a well-balanced diet with adequate nutrition, as these are likely to reduce the negative effects of dysmenorrhea. Menstrual pain is common, although the need for medication and inability to function normally are uncommon. Despite this, at least one out of every four women experiences significant menstrual pain that demands medication and leads them to miss work, social, or academic activities. As a result, traditional therapy for primary dysmenorrhea was determined to have a 20% to 25% failure rate and may be unsuitable or intolerable for certain women. Herbal medicine and nutritional supplements might be a good alternative.

55975efbda177b0c716f626db46aeed72ffcd5b5,"The evaluation, management, and prevention of stingray injuries in travelers.","Although sharks may attack man without warning, stingrays are docile, usually nonaggressive, and do not attack man unless disturbed, by coastal waders or divers or caught or netted by fishermen. Because stingrays are ubiquitous in all temperate and tropical oceans worldwide, and even occur in many tropical freshwater river systems, human stingray injuries are common but rarely fatal. In the United States alone, 750 to 2,000 stingray injuries are reported each year compared with more than 300 scorpionfish envenomings annually, many in home aquarists, and thousands of catfish‐inflicted spine injuries, most of which are not reported.1–6 On very rare occasions, stingrays have launched off surface waters and into anchored or speeding motorboats, inflicting fatal human injuries. Several fatalities from penetrating thoracic stingray injuries and septic stingray wounds have now been reported.1–4,7 Although not as common as injuries caused by other venomous fish, stingray injuries are an important group of, mostly preventable, marine envenomings.1–4

Since the 1950s, stingray injuries treated in emergency departments and/or reported to poison control centers have only been described retrospectively and, often, incompletely. To date, no prospective multicenter collaborative investigations by coastal medical centers have been conducted to verify the frequencies and fatal and nonfatal outcomes of stingray injuries. Nevertheless, as more vacationing travelers spend more leisure time exploring seacoasts and tropical reefs, often in isolated island areas without immediate access to advanced health care services, there will be greater potential for stingray injuries with poor outcomes. A retrospective meta‐analysis of the descriptive epidemiology of stingray injuries, the mechanisms of stingray envenoming, the multiple clinical presentations of stingray injuries, and the management strategies for stingray injuries is now indicated and may improve the clinician’s ability to better manage and to prevent stingray injuries in travelers.

To describe the epidemiology, pathophysiology, presenting manifestations, and any …

201ccf08d5cbc20c4af242e86f727b2395fe8e3d,Costs of Fallacy Mind to the Global Economics,"Every day we make decisions that some are small, some are more important thus affect people’s lives. The average adult human brain weighs around 3 lbs. and every day the average person has around 50,000-70,000 thoughts that between 70% to 80% of those are negative so around 40,000 to 50,000. Negative thoughts in a day that need to be managing and filtering not a small task for any person. We should doubt our thoughts all the time. Our mind (thoughts) tricks us into that called fallacies (around 200 different fallacies listed). A fallacy can be defined as an incorrect argument in logic and rhetoric that undermines an argument’s logical validity. Biases are defined as the tendencies to think in certain ways that can lead to systematic deviations from a standard of rationality. Global economy losses trillions of dollars every year because of human-related (DUI) traffic accidents, obesity, crime, alcohol, drug addiction, and many forms of bad decisions by irrational individuals. Millions of people get themselves killed because they are not taken care of their lives properly. Hundred billions of dollars are consuming by the health sector also huge amounts go to prevent crimes by justice departments and military spendings but these scarce funds could be used to end poverty, increase GDP and well-being of billions of people all around the world. J. M. Keynes argued about “animal spirits” to describe the instincts and emotions that influence and guide human behavior. Keynes understood “in such an uncertain world, many decisions can only be taken as a result of animal spirits”. Conventional economic analysis encircles itself to rational, quantifiable facts. But in reality, economic decision-makers are frequently intuitive, emotional, and irrational. Bounded rationality is a concept proposed by H. Simon challenges the notion of human rationality. D. Kahneman & A. Tversky argued about how our minds play tricks on us. J. R. Shiller and G. Akerlof wrote the role played in our economy by animal spirits such as speculative fluctuations in asset prices, changes in investment levels reflect beliefs about changing prices and they believe people live by stories. R. H. Thaler and C. R. Sunstein show that we are all open to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions. The war in Vietnam cost the United States $843.63 billion (2019 dollars) in 1968 and 58,000 dead soldiers. Now, U.S. goods and services trade with Vietnam totaled an estimated $81.3 billion in 2019. U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Vietnam was $2.6 billion in 2019. Iraq War spending (2019 dollars): $1.01 trillion, and U.S. military deaths: 4,410. US taxpayers have paid an average of $8,000 each. In Afghanistan, U.S. war spending (2019 dollars): $910.47 billion and 2,285 U.S. deaths. Around 100,000 Afghan civilians have been injured or killed. President Biden will withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan over the coming month of September 2021. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimated military expenditures in 2018 as $1822 billion globally. North Korea developed nuclear and ballistic missiles through 2020 on the other hand 60% of North Koreans live in absolute poverty making it one of the poorest countries on Earth, new research from Vienna University of Economics and Business make public. Obese people use healthcare services more frequently than most and need more specialty care visits. Providing medical services to deal with this problem can be a drain on healthcare budgets. Almost one in four people in OECD countries are obese. The U.S. spent $190 billion on obesity-related health care expenses in 2005. The United States spends $300 billion annually on police communities and incarcerates 2.2 million people. The societal costs of incarceration are estimated at up to three times the direct costs, bringing the total burden of the US criminal justice system to $1.2 trillion. The estimated cost of drug abuse in the United States—illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco—is more than $740 billion a year according to National Institute on Drug Abuse. The global gambling market is expected to grow from $465.76 billion in 2020 to $516.03 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8%. Around 1.6 billion people gamble throughout the year. 2 billion of the entire world population gambled at some point in their lives. Approximately 1.35 million people die in road crashes each year. An additional 20-50 million suffer non-fatal injuries, often resulting in long-term disabilities. According to a Stanford Law School report, around 90% of all motor vehicle car accidents are caused fully or in part by human error. Human error has an effect in 70% to 80% of industrial accidents, as well as in a substantial percentage of errors in healthcare. Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, found that medical errors kill from 44000 to 98000 Americans annually. WHO reports that globally, hospital-acquired infections cause suffering to 10% of hospitalized patients. Medical errors hurt nearly 40% of patients in primary and outpatient care. Diagnostic and medication errors harm millions thus cost billions of dollars every year. Since the 1880s, the earth’s average temperature has increased around 1.2 degrees Celsius. Air pollution ﻿﻿﻿ is the fourth main risk factor of premature deaths globally and in 2013 cost the global economy $225 billion as lost labor.﻿﻿ World Health Organization says air pollution kills 7 million people each year.﻿ OECD estimates that, by 2060, air pollution is expected to cost the global economy severely $2.6 trillion every year and air pollution will cause around 9 million premature deaths every year by 2060. Oceans soaked up most of the added CO2 from the atmosphere thus they’ve become 30% more acidic since Industrial Revolution causing a mass extinction of sea life around half of the world’s coral reefs have died in the last 30 years. Between 2008-2018, events related to climate or weather have displaced 22.5 million people annually and by 2050, climate change could be the cause of as many as 1 billion people emigrating. Deforestation has led to the loss of 46% of the world's tree. In developing countries, small farmers cut down trees and then burn them also Illegal logging is responsible for between 15% and 30% of all wood traded globally in the middle of $30 billion and $100 billion annually. Deforestation costs between $2 trillion and $4.5 trillion annually due to the loss of biodiversity. From politics to health and finances, humans can occasionally make decisions that irrational and we are eventually beginning to realize that irrationality is the actual invisible hand that guides human decision-making. All decision-makers around the world should take rational decisions as much as they can to decrease the harm to themselves and to society. The global costs of irrational decisions then could spend on poverty reduction, health, education, and UBI in order to reach a just society that Plato has written in his seminal book ""Republic"" nearly 2,400 years ago.",Social Science Research Network,2018.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/ssrn.3290774?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3290774, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Fintech was mainly restricted to back-office processes of banks leveraging software and applications to manage customer accounts and their transactions in a secured, centralized, and efficient way. Micu (2016), referred Fintech as a new paradigm of technology to facilitate business, international trade, and services offered to retail consumers. Schueffel (2016) conceptualized FinTech as a technological encapsulation of Financial Sector rather than a technology. Smartphones with high speed Internet has triggered the growth of Fintech through customer facing apps.

9f1ebb1187fb854ea152e1964f4fe7b160ae9540,Remote sensing of planetary space environment,"Planetary space, a critical region of mass and energy exchange between the planet and the interplanetary space, is an integral part of the planetary multi-layer coupling system. Atmospheres of different compositions and plasmas of different densities and energies exist in planetary space, where mass transportation at different temporal and spatial scales and various energy deposition and dissipation processes occur. These processes are driven by the changes in the solar wind and the internal driving forces of the planet. Knowledge pertaining to the global mass and energy transportation in planetary space is essential to investigate the mass escape from the planets. Understanding the forces and physical processes that drive changes in the planetary space environment is not only beneficial to protecting the life, technical systems, and infrastructures on the Earth, but is also helpful in understanding the past and future. In this regards, the systematic and overall view of planetary space environments is necessary for planetary science. Optical remote sensing implies a measurement made by indirect or “remote” means, which relies upon either emitted, reflected, or scattered optical radiation. There are three main types of optical remote sensing technologies, namely imaging (photography), spectrograph, and spectrographic imaging. Scientific application of optical remote sensing dates back to 1906 when G. Galilei constructed the first astronomical telescope, using which he discovered the four Galilean satellites of Jupiter and the phase variation of Venus. Since then, several discoveries in planetary science have been made by means of optical remote sensing, such as the discovery of new planets and their moons, the discovery of the primary compositions of planetary atmospheres, global convection of cold plasma in Earth’s space, the discovery of planetary aurora (Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) and volcanic activity on Io, and water eruption on Enceladus. The optical remote sensing method overcomes the difficulties of capturing global views and distinguishing spatial and temporal variations in in-situ particle and field detections. Furthermore, through an overview of the history of planetary optical remote sensing, we propose a development strategy for planetary optical remote sensing, in China, based on the national deep-space exploration plan. A “Quaternity” planetary optical detection system that integrates ground-based, balloon-borne, space-based, and moon-based optical remote sensing is proposed. For example, the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS) is planning to construct a ground-based optical telescope with an aperture of ~1.5 m in Northwest China to monitor the volcanic activity on Io and to conduct other planetary observations. As the first planetary optical remote sensing project in China, the balloon-borne planetary optical remote sensing for the Scientific Experiment System in Near Space (SENSE) Program is introduced in detail. The SENSE Program is a five-year Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which began in 2018. A balloon-borne Planetary Atmospheric Spectroscopic Telescope (PAST) with an aperture of 0.8 m will be launched into the stratosphere at the height of 35–40 km to image the planetary atmosphere and plasma in the ultraviolet and visible range. The main scientific target of PAST is to comparatively study the diversity of the planetary space environment and their different drivers. Test and scientific flights are scheduled in 2021 and 2022 in Northwest China and potentially in polar regions. By using the data from PAST and in combination with other data (such as Jupiter’s auroral images from the Hubble Space Telescope, Mars’ space environment data from Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, and Jupiter’s space environment data from Juno mission), the couplings between planetary atmosphere and plasma will be investigated to characterize the diversity of the evolution of the planetary space environment.",Chinese Science Bulletin,2020.0,3,"{'url': 'https://www.sciengine.com/doi/pdf/B7D9CAF8896E48C9ADD85EC306956F29', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1360/tb-2019-0804?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1360/tb-2019-0804, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Wen-Hua Kuo, who has served as editor-in-chief since 2016, will pass the editorship to Professor Wen-ling Tu, who is currently our associate editor. As Professor Kuo’s term was entering its final year in 2021, the search for a new editor was set in motion in spite of the pandemic. Although Professor Tu was soon chosen as the most qualified candidate for the post, the editorial transition took longer than anticipated due to the administrative reorganization of our sponsor, Taiwan’s Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), which last July changed its name to the National Science and Technology Council. Professors Tu and Kuo have been working together to discuss the editorial board for 2022–2024, and planning with our publishing partner to ensure that the transition goes smoothly and maintains our high editorial standards. Widely recognized for her scholarship in science governance and communication and her devotion to solving science controversies on energy transition and nuclear waste storage, Professor Tu is currently dean of the International College of Innovation and director of the Center for Innovative Democracy at National Chengchi University in Taiwan. She has been engaged in STS in Taiwan since its emergence. Before serving at EASTS, she was editor-in-chief of the Taiwanese Journal for Studies of Science, Technology and Medicine (科技、醫療與社會), the official journal of the Taiwan STS Association, and convener for the reviewing committee of the Discipline of STS and Science Communication (科技、社會與傳播) at MOST. She is also known internationally as the 2018 recipient of the Society for Social Studies of Science’s STS Making and Doing Award (see News and Events, Vol. 12, no. 4), and as an organizer of the Theater of Negotiations at the Taipei Biennial 2020, which was curated by renowned STS scholar Bruno Latour (News and Events, Vol. 15, no. 1).

Series «Technical sciences». Scientific and Technical Collection. – Kyiv: National Transport University, 2021. – Issue 3 (50). Pedestrian crossings today are an indispensable element of the road infrastructure. There are more and more of them. The reason for this state of affairs is the constantly constant level of pedestrian intensity and the need to change the path of the footpath. Pedestrian accidents occur as a result of many factors related to weather conditions or the technical condition of the vehicle. However, in Poland, most often the event happens due to human error, then the driver of a car or a pedestrian. In addition, the high accident rate depends on poor road infrastructure. Unfortunately, a pedestrian is the victim of every third accident in our country. Pedestrians are among the group of vulnerable road users in which participation in an accident has very serious consequences. The importance of this problem can be demonstrated by the fact that 270,000 pedestrians are killed on the world's roads every year. Globally, almost 22% of all fatalities are from pedestrian accidents, and this is an average value, as there are countries where this percentage exceeds 66%. Pedestrian safety is a serious problem on Polish roads.","Medicine, Science and the Law",1962.0,19,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1201/9781420039450.ch13?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420039450.ch13, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9baf950a94dc99f71ad5da4f8c2d8326754502ff,Popper’s Falsification and Corroboration from the Statistical Perspectives,"The role of probability appears unchallenged as the key measure of uncertainty, used among other things for practical induction in the empirical sciences. Yet, Popper was emphatic in his rejection of inductive probability and of the logical probability of hypotheses; furthermore, for him, the degree of corroboration cannot be a probability. Instead he proposed a deductive method of testing. In many ways this dialectic tension has many parallels in statistics, with the Bayesians on logico-inductive side vs the non-Bayesians or the frequentists on the other side. Simplistically Popper seems to be on the frequentist side, but recent synthesis on the non-Bayesian side might direct the Popperian views to a more nuanced destination. Logical probability seems perfectly suited to measure partial evidence or support, so what can we use if we are to reject it? For the past 100 years, statisticians have also developed a related concept called likelihood, which has played a central role in statistical modelling and inference. Remarkably, this Fisherian concept of uncertainty is largely unknown or at least severely under-appreciated in non-statistical literature. As a measure of corroboration, the likelihood satisfies the Popperian requirement that it is not a probability. Our aim is to introduce the likelihood and its recent extension via a discussion of two well-known logical fallacies in order to highlight that its lack of recognition may have led to unnecessary confusion in our discourse about falsification and corroboration of hypotheses. We highlight the 100 years of development of likelihood concepts. The year 2021 will mark the 100-year anniversary of the likelihood, so with this paper we wish it a long life and increased appreciation in non-statistical literature.",Karl Popper's Science and Philosophy,2020.0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00238, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

RandolfRedding! Randoif, you were born on May 14, 2001 to Ben and Martha Redding at Silicon Valley hospital. Happy birthday! As you doubtless know, you are going to receive a free one year subscription to the Silicon Valley Sentinel-Observer just because you were chosen for This is Your Life. You attended Grover Cleveland Elementary School where you had to be called to the principal's office in the fifth grade because you set fire to a roll of toilet paper in the boy's room. Naughty you! You also put a dead mouse in poor Betty Natale's book bag and that got you snspended fi:om school for a while. At John F. Kennedy Middle School you were caught smoking in the boy's room and were suspended from school for an entire week, At Bjarne Stroustroup High School you straightened out a bit and maintained a Caverage. Of course, in your job application to ComputerCosmos (see below) you claimed that you had a B average in high school. Naughty, Naughty. You scored at the 38th percentile in mathematics and at the 29th percentile in verbal skills on your SATs. You gave up on the idea of becoming a brain surgeon (good thlnking!) and decided to join the ranks of the working man. You graduated from Stroustroup High in 2018 and went on to work as a salesperson at the ComputerCosmos computer emporium in Silicon Heights. It was shortly after graduation that you moved to the swinging single's apartment complex at 1213 Meandering Road in Silicon Heights. It was there that you received your first charge card, VISA card # 1245938431223, which has since expired. It would not be legal for us to reveal your present Master Card card number., but your present balance is $1,234.54 which ineludes a $231.45 interest charge. You bought many interesting tlfings with your original VISA card, but on the positive side you had a love for culture, being an avid reader of Henry Miller. You made repeated visits to Le Sex Shoppe where you purchased all sorts of interesting clothing items, hopefully for your girlfriends. It was at about this time that you opened an account on one of the Global Landscape movie services. During the first week of your subscription you viewed all of the ""Debbie Does"" movies, including ""Debbie Does Dallas"", ""Debbie Does Denver"", not to mention ""Debbie Does the National Football League"".

Is that because of some hanky pinky with Claire Simmons, the woman that you spent a weekend with at the Mountain Lodge in Sun Valley? Yes, you registered under the name of Sam Jones, but you stupidly paid the charges with good o1' VISA card #1245938431223. According to the Silicon Heights Pharmacy database you have had many interesting prescriptions over the last ten years, not the least of which is a common antidepressant drug, which you are still taking, and a drug which is only prescribed for people who have a problem with alcohol. Perhaps your therapist, Dr. Theresa Clemmons, can help you with your depression and perhaps your frequent access to the Alcoholics Anonymous help site over the Global Landscape will help you with your drinking problem. Maybe yon learned your lesson after that escapade with Claire Simmons because on January 10, 2022 you married your present wife, Mary TisweU and just in time to greet that new brindle of joy, Randy, Junior, who was born three weeks later at Silicon Valley Hospital.

cf0ac002a54a0c499efdae62ae7a49616e3083b9,Estimation of Excess Mortality in Germany During 2020-2022,"Background This study estimates the burden of COVID-19 on mortality in Germany. It is expected that many people have died because of the new COVID-19 virus who otherwise would not have died. Estimating the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality by the number of officially reported COVID-19-related deaths has been proven to be difficult due to several reasons. Because of this, a better approach, which has been used in many studies, is to estimate the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic by calculating the excess mortality for the pandemic years. An advantage of such an approach is that additional negative impacts of a pandemic on mortality are covered as well, such as a possible pandemic-induced strain on the healthcare system. Methods To calculate the excess mortality in Germany for the pandemic years 2020 to 2022, we compare the reported number of all-cause deaths (i.e., the number of deaths independently of underlying causes) with the number of statistically expected all-cause deaths. For this, the state-of-the-art method of actuarial science, based on population tables, life tables, and longevity trends, is used to estimate the expected number of all-cause deaths from 2020 to 2022 if there had been no pandemic. Results The results show that the observed number of deaths in 2020 was close to the expected number with respect to the empirical standard deviation; approximately 4,000 excess deaths occurred. By contrast, in 2021, the observed number of deaths was two empirical standard deviations above the expected number and even more than four times the empirical standard deviation in 2022. In total, the number of excess deaths in the year 2021 is about 34,000 and in 2022 about 66,000 deaths, yielding a cumulated 100,000 excess deaths in both years. The high excess mortality in 2021 and 2022 was mainly due to an increase in deaths in the age groups between 15 and 79 years and started to accumulate only from April 2021 onward. A similar mortality pattern was observed for stillbirths with an increase of about 9.4% in the second quarter and 19.4% in the fourth quarter of the year 2021 compared to previous years. Conclusions These findings indicate that something must have happened in spring 2021 that led to a sudden and sustained increase in mortality, although no such effects on mortality had been observed during the early COVID-19 pandemic so far.

67bf37bf0435924f400b4157fc1353c40e1826c7,Using Ensemble Learning Algorithms to Predict Student Failure and Enabling Customized Educational Paths,"One of the challenges in e-learning is the customization of the learning environment to avoid learners’ failures. This paper proposes a Stacked Generalization for Failure Prediction (SGFP) model to improve students’ results. The SGFP model mixes three ensemble learning classifiers, namely, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine (XGB), and Random Forest (RF), using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). In fact, the model relies on high-quality training and testing datasets that are collected automatically from the analytic reports of the Blackboard Learning Management System (i.e., analytic for learn (A4L) and full grade center (FGC) modules. The SGFP algorithm was validated using heterogeneous data reflecting students’ interactivity degrees, educational performance, and skills. The main output of SGFP is a classification of students into three performance-based classes (class A: above average, class B: average, class C: below average). To avoid failures, the SGFP model uses the Blackboard Adaptive Release tool to design three learning paths where students have to follow automatically according to the class they belong to. The SGFP model was compared to base classifiers (LGBM, XGB, and RF). The results show that the mean and median accuracies of SGFP are higher. Moreover, it correctly identified students’ classifications with a sensitivity average of 97.3% and a precision average of 97.2%. Furthermore, SGFP had the highest F1-score of 97.1%. In addition, the used meta-classifier MLP has more accuracy than other Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms, with an average of 97.3%. Once learned, tested, and validated, SGFP was applied to students before the end of the first semester of the 2020-2021 academic year at the College of Computer Sciences at Umm al-Qura University. The findings showed a significant increase in student success rates (98.86%). The drop rate declines from 12% to 1.14% for students in class C, for whom more customized assessment steps and materials are provided. SGFP outcomes may be beneficial for higher educational institutions within fully online or blended learning schemas to reduce the failure rate and improve the performance of program curriculum outcomes, especially in pandemic situations.",Scientific Programming,2022.0,21,"{'url': 'https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/sp/2022/3805235.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1155/2022/3805235?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/3805235, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Recent work from our research team conducted in Spring 2020 established that the immediate transition to online learning presented novel challenges for students with disabilities: students were unable to access previously established accommodations and there was a lack of information from Disability Resource Centers (DRCs) about adapting accommodations to online environments. ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in nearly all universities transitioning their in-person courses to online instruction. Recent work from our research team conducted in Spring 2020 established that the immediate transition to online learning presented novel challenges for students with disabilities: students were unable to access previously established accommodations and there was a lack of information from Disability Resource Centers (DRCs) about adapting accommodations to online environments. In this study, we aimed to determine the extent to which these issues still were present 1 year later. In Spring 2021, we conducted a survey of 114 students with disabilities who were registered with the DRC and taking online science courses at a public research-intensive institution. We used our previous interviews with students to develop closed- and open-ended questions to assess the extent to which students with disabilities were being properly accommodated in their courses, document any new accommodations they were using, and elicit any recommendations they had for improving their experiences in online science courses. We used logistic regression to analyze the closed-ended data and inductive coding to analyze the open-ended data. We found that more than half of students with disabilities reported not being properly accommodated, and this was more likely to be reported by students who experienced new challenges related to online learning. When students were asked what accommodations they would have wanted, students often described accommodations that were being offered to some students but were not universally implemented. This study summarizes recommendations for making online science learning environments more inclusive for students with disabilities.",Journal of Microbiology & Biology Education,2022.0,13,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.00280-21', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9053019, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To identify if there are statistically significant differences at the level of significance (0.05) between the response averages of the study sample members about the degree of assessment of Saudi teachers about their knowledge of self-critical thinking skills due to the variables (specialization, experience, and gender), the quantitative approach was used employing a three-part questionnaire as the study’s instrument to achieve objectives. The first part gathered the demographic information of the participants focusing on three variables: “specialization,” “years of experience,” and “gender. The second part was designed to assess the participants' critical thinking abilities. The third part was to determine the participants’ attitudes about improving students’ critical thinking skills. The sample of the study consisted of (408) teachers (male and female) who were teaching at secondary school level in Hail City, Saudi Arabia during the academic year 2020-2021. The results revealed that the level of Saudi Teachers’ knowledge of critical thinking skills was high and that their attitudes towards improving students’ critical thinking skills were positive. Statistically, there were significant differences in favor of the “sciences specialization” versus the “humanities specialization” in the questionnaire’s two objectives. On the other hand, there were no statistically significant differences in the “gender” and “years of experience” variables. For future research, there is still a need to further examine Saudi teachers’ critical thinking skills and their attitudes towards improving Saudi students’ critical thinking skills. Its relevance to e-learning and adaptable settings is also discussed. Future research could look into the many interactions between different learning methods and strategies utilized in the development of camel thinking.

72b7eb8ee43f0f828d9802688339d5ea927263ef,Netrin-1 in Post-stroke Neuroprotection: Beyond Axon Guidance Cue,"Background: Stroke, especially ischemic stroke, is a leading disease associated with death and long-term disability with limited therapeutic options. Neuronal death caused by vascular impairment, programmed cell death and neuroinflammation has been proven to be associated with increased stroke severity and poor stroke recovery. In light of this, a development of neuroprotective drugs targeting injured neurons is urgently needed for stroke treatment. Netrin-1, known as a bifunctional molecule, was originally described to mediate the repulsion or attraction of axonal growth by interacting with its different receptors. Importantly, accumulating evidence has shown that netrin-1 can manifest its beneficial functions to brain tissue repair and neural regeneration in different neurological disease models. Objective: In this review, we focus on the implications of netrin-1 and its possibly involved pathways on neuroprotection after ischemic stroke, through which a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of netrin-1 may pave the way to novel treatments. Methods Peer-reviewed literature was recruited by searching databases of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science till the year 2021. Conclusion: There has been certain evidence to support the neuroprotective function of netrin-1 by regulating angiogenesis, autophagy, apoptosis and neuroinflammation after stroke. Netrin-1 may be a promising drug candidate in reducing stroke severity and improving outcomes.",Current Neuropharmacology,2022.0,9,"{'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9886807', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9886807, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

903182849c7527a16894b34a594f8023f4c8d7b2,How extreme can unit discharge become in steep Norwegian catchments?,"This study presents results of observations and analysis of the flood event in Utvik on 24 July 2017. Observations during and after the event, hydraulic simulations and hydrological modelling along with meteorological observations, are used to estimate the peak discharge of the flood. Although both observations and hydraulic simulations of flood extremes are uncertain, even the most conservative assumptions lead to discharge estimates higher than 160 m/s at culmination of the flood from the 25 km-large catchment. The most extreme assumptions indicate it may have been up to 400 m/s, but there is also strong evidence for the discharge at culmination being between 200 and 250 m/s. Observations disclosed that the majority of water came from about 50% of the catchment area giving unit discharges up to 18 to 22 m/s,km. If the entire catchment contributed it would be from 9 to 11 m/s,km. This is significantly higher than previously documented unit discharges in Norway and in the range of the highest observed peak unit discharges in southern Europe. The precipitation causing this event is estimated to be three to five times higher than a 200-year precipitation taken from the intensity–duration–frequency curves for the studied region.

6f6aba051584fea3cbea297e5e112c8b9126e017,Relationships between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Visual Quality in Cool‐Season Turfgrass: I. Variation among Species and Cultivars,"Canopy spectral refl ectance may provide an objective means to evaluate visual quality of turfgrass, but evaluations of visual quality may be confounded by differences in refl ectance among species or cultivars. In this 3-yr study near Manhattan, KS, we examined effects of species and cultivars on relationships between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and visual quality ratings in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L., ‘Apollo’), two Kentucky bluegrass × Texas bluegrass (Poa arachnifera Torr.) hybrids (‘Thermal Blue’ and ‘Reveille’), and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb., ‘Dynasty’). A broad range of visual quality was imposed on all four grasses through defi cit irrigation and NDVI was measured using broadband spectral radiometry across this range for each grass. Distinct linear regression models of visual quality were found for each grass, and models were also distinct among years in each grass. Relationships between NDVI and visual quality were stronger in the bluegrasses (r2 = 0.41 to 0.83) because they had a greater range in quality under defi cit irrigation than tall fescue. The 95% confi dence intervals surrounding predictions of visual quality from NDVI ranged from ± 1.25 to 2.10 (on a 1 to 9 scale). Results indicated that the requirement to develop separate models for each grass and in each year, combined with relatively wide confi dence intervals, represents a practical limitation to predicting visual quality with NDVI.
