40ec2d5d5f1b3233a48a5c292dfb7d9219f94f79,CHALLENGES OF AN E-LEARNING PLATFORM FOR TEACHING CREATIVITY,"As Ken Robinson noted, ""children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065"". How many of today's ""professions for the future"" will still exist in 2025? We don't know. We don't know how the future will look like, yet we claim to educate our children to face its challenges. Under these circumstances, an important ethical question raises: ""to what extent the modern School really fulfills its mission to prepare the students for the future?""
In our opinion, the main risk of the modern education is to create people that are unable to keep pace with the fast changing world where they live in.
In this paper, we argue that a systematic education for creativity appears to be the only solution to provide our students with the minimal tools to cope with the uncertainties of the future. And we suggest that an open access e-learning platform dedicated to teaching creativity might be the most efficient way to solve this problem on a large scale.
However, this is not an easy task. In this paper, we describe some of the challenges we face in the implementation of the Leonardo da Vinci project ""TECRINO - Teaching creativity in engineering"", whose main objective is to develop the appropriate educational content and to setup a Moodle platform for teaching creativity.
Among these challenges, we count the fuzzyness of the definition of some essential concepts like ""creative thinking skills"" , and the lack of simple and easy to use creativity assessment tools.
We believe that the modest attainment reported here is the essential firt step on the long road of a systematic education for creativity.",11th International Conference eLearning and Software for Education,2015.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.12753/2066-026x-15-055?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.12753/2066-026x-15-055, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As per IDC report, it is estimated that by the year 2025, 175 zettabytes of data will be generated and major portion of this data will be produced by the e-commerce giants. In a country like India, which is the fifth largest economy in the world, the share of e-commerce is 58.97 billion USD in the economy. In the growing area of e-commerce, there is dire need to collect, clean, process, analyse, evaluate and publish Indian consumer's attitude regarding cyber security, privacy and compliance readiness. Therefore, in this article, an effort has been made to apply multi-criteria decision analysis along with Likert scale to accomplish the above said task. We are confident that this effort will be taken as an important exercise between e-commerce and Indian consumers, to measure the cyber security concerns.

6e42544f1d4a21f81bb1e1989d6a1d480becee0b,Preface,"On behalf of the Program Committee, we are delighted to present the Proceedings of the 1st Microarchitectural Security Conference (µASC 2025). The µASC conference fills a gap in the security research landscape, focusing on the advancement our understanding of the security of microarchitectures of all kinds and on all layers. Our goal this year was to attract high-quality research from academia and industry through various formats accommodating the different needs of the researchers. For this reason, we accepted three types of submissions: papers, posters, and talks.
Although it was µASC’s first year, we received 22 valid submissions. We assigned 3 reviewers to each submission, resulting in 66 reviews overall. Papers reviews were conducted as double-blind reviews, for posters and talks, the authors were able to choose between single-blind and double-blind peer review. We received 7 paper submissions, out of which the program committee accepted 6 papers, resulting in an acceptance rate of 86%. We received 9 talk submissions, out of which the program committee accepted 8 talks, resulting in an acceptance rate of 89%. We accepted all 6 poster submissions.
We thank all members of the µASC Steering Committee for their hard work on laying the foundation for this new conference. We would also like to express our deep gratitude to them for volunteering as the first Program Committee as well, for their reviewing effort, for discussions (more than 80 comments for 22 submissions), and for reviewing revisions of shepherded submissions. We appreciate the support from our sponsor Google as well as our host institutions.
Finally, we thank the authors who submitted their work and presented their contributions, as well as the attendees who participated in the conference. µASC was held on campus at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. With about 80 participants, the conference’s first year was already much larger than we anticipated and it created a unique opportunity to network, discuss, engage, and socialize with other researchers and practitioners interested in all kinds of microarchitectures. We look forward to future years and future contributions.",Proceedings of the Microarchitecture Security Conference,2025.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.46586/uasc.2025.000?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.46586/uasc.2025.000, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0e86b960a66ff7e65329c9faa751f579b52bfc64,The posterity of Zadeh's 50-year-old paper,"This article was commissioned by the 22nd IEEE International Conference of Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE) to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Lotfi Zadeh's seminal 1965 paper on fuzzy sets. In addition to Lotfi's original paper, this note itemizes 100 citations of books and papers deemed “important (significant, seminal, etc.)” by 20 of the 21 living IEEE CIS Fuzzy Systems pioneers. Each of the 20 contributors supplied 5 citations, and Lotfi's paper makes the overall list a tidy 101, as in “Fuzzy Sets 101”. This note is not a survey in any real sense of the word, but the contributors did offer short remarks to indicate the reason for inclusion (e.g., historical, topical, seminal, etc.) of each citation. Citation statistics are easy to find and notoriously erroneous, so we refrain from reporting them - almost. The exception is that according to Google scholar on April 9, 2015, Lotfi's 1965 paper has been cited 55,479 times.",IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems,2015.0,0,0,"{'url': 'https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01290103/file/bezdek_15501.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'other-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2015.7337858?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2015.7337858, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b2d441e45760b7654a5400834bb7e1bf3d36061b,Temporal and Spatial Classification of Active IPv6 Addresses,"There is striking volume of World-Wide Web activity on IPv6 today. In early 2015, one large Content Distribution Network handles 50 billion IPv6 requests per day from hundreds of millions of IPv6 client addresses; billions of unique client addresses are observed per month. Address counts, however, obscure the number of hosts with IPv6 connectivity to the global Internet. There are numerous address assignment and subnetting options in use; privacy addresses and dynamic subnet pools significantly inflate the number of active IPv6 addresses. As the IPv6 address space is vast, it is infeasible to comprehensively probe every possible unicast IPv6 address. Thus, to survey the characteristics of IPv6 addressing, we perform a year-long passive measurement study, analyzing the IPv6 addresses gleaned from activity logs for all clients accessing a global CDN. The goal of our work is to develop flexible classification and measurement methods for IPv6, motivated by the fact that its addresses are not merely more numerous; they are different in kind. We introduce the notion of classifying addresses and prefixes in two ways: (1) temporally, according to their instances of activity to discern which addresses can be considered stable; (2) spatially, according to the density or sparsity of aggregates in which active addresses reside.

bb895139c33b52a4f6c6cb54b8069dab86dab770,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,"It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 21st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD). Theannual ACM SIGKDD conference is the premier international forum for data science, data mining, knowledge discovery and big data. It brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to share their ideas, research results and experiences. 
 
KDD-2015 features 4 plenary keynote presentations, 12 invited talks, 228 paper presentations, a discussion panel, a poster session, 14 workshops, 12 tutorials, 27 exhibition booths, the KDD Cup competition, and a banquet at the Dockside Pavilion at the Sydney Darling Harbour. As always, KDD-2015 attracted presenters and delegates from around the world. It is with great pleasure that we bring this international conference for the first time to the southern hemisphere. 
 
This year we again had a strong set of submissions. There were 819 submissions to the Research Track, of which 160 papers were accepted. There were 189 submissions to the Industry & Government Track, of which 68 papers were accepted. All papers submitted to the Research Track and to the Industry & Government Tracks were subjected to a rigorous review process. They were initially screened by the Chairs of the respective tracks, and a small number of papers that did not comply with the formatting requirements or which violated the dual submission policy were summarily rejected. At least three reviewers and a metareviewer were assigned to all remaining papers based on the results of a bidding process. The authors were able to read the reviews and provide a response. The meta-reviewers then had an opportunity to consider all reviews and author responses. This then initiated a discussion during which all reviewers of a paper had the opportunity to read each other's reviews and the author responses and to update their reviews as appropriate. In a few cases, the meta-reviewers added another reviewer at this stage to gain expert opinion on specific issues. The meta-reviewers then made recommendations on acceptance or rejection to the track chairs. The track chairs then assessed the meta-reviews, reviews, author responses and discussions to make a final decision. In a few cases, they also solicited further expert reviews and meta-reviews to resolve specific questions. Thus, all papers were assessed by at least four and up to seven discipline experts. All accepted papers were presented both as a 20-minute talk and as a poster. 
 
The Industry & Government Invited Talk Track features 12 talks from world renowned experts who have played a significant role in developing and deploying large-scale data mining applications and systems in their respective fields with clearly measurable and meaningful impact. We trust that this opportunity for the KDD community to hear directly from senior leaders in industry and government will inspire new advances and broader interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers, industry and government counterparts. Featured topics in this year's Industry & Government Invited Talk Track include applications in cloud intelligence, personal finance, insurance, fraud, marketing, advertising, and telecommunications. Additionally, we have focused on key enabling BigData infrastructure for KDD technologies with talks on highly-scalable and open source solutions that are quickly becoming mainstream.

ead6da550f14275f4d230f3c01f7e5aac11c8039,The impacts of project based learning on self-directed learning and professional skill attainment: A comparison of project based learning to traditional engineering education,"Based upon a successful implementation of an upper-division project based learning (PBL) curriculum, an integrated first/second year PBL experience was designed and implemented. The integrated courses were physics 1, statics, design, and professionalism. The curriculum has been delivered from 2012 to 2015. This work in progress paper describes the design process, the trajectory of the program as it continuously improved, data collection methods, and initial results. Two of the members of this research team were members of the team that adapted the Aalborg (Denmark) model of PBL to an upper division 100% PBL curriculum. The model evolved into an ABET accredited program that is based on the solution of complex industry problems for the last four semesters of a bachelors degree. The results were used as the basis for the design of this lower division PBL program. The lower division program evolved from 2012 to 2015. Upon conclusion of the lower division experience, survey instruments were administered to students. Tools specific to self-directed learning and professional development were employed. The instruments are the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and professional development and professional expectations instruments designed by the authors of this paper.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2015.0,27,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344028?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344028, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f271bcafd1aa76c7286616b3c0f105458ea5ac2c,Role of ICT-enabled virtual laboratories in biotechnology education: Case studies on blended and remote learning,"Virtual labs are popularized as a visual education tool that offers diverse analysis of experiments through different components like graphics mediated animations, mathematically modeled simulations, user-interactive emulations, remote-triggered experiments and the use of augmented perception haptic devices. With the advances in ICT-based education, virtual labs have become a novel platform that helps users to engage in their proactive learning process. Our goal was to analyze the effective role of biotechnology virtual labs in improving academic performance of students and complementing classroom education. We tested the adaptability, perceived usefulness and ease of use of biotechnology virtual labs on different user groups in sciences and engineering. This study focuses mainly on the student and teacher groups from different universities across India. Feedback data was collected via a direct approach using organized workshops conducted in the year 2014-2015. 85% of participants suggested perceived usefulness of biotechnology virtual labs helped them to improve their academic performance compared to a traditional classroom scenario. Most users indicated the learning materials provided by virtual lab system were easy to understand, thus suggesting the better adaptability of ICT-enabled techniques amongst different users. This augments the role of virtual labs for remote learners all over the world. For India, such learning methods have helped overcome limitations seen in classroom-based education such as equipment accessibility, location and other economic issues. Through these studies, we construe the usage of virtual labs as a next-gen interactive textbook and as a media-rich learning source of distance and blended education.",International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning,2015.0,21,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICL.2015.7318149?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICL.2015.7318149, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

cdd8b0bffedc7ae721116ba02636817567cca2ac,Evaluating flipped classrooms with respect to threshold concepts learning in undergraduate engineering,"This paper reports on the initial findings from a two year (2015-2016) investigation of the impact of the flipped classroom on student learning of threshold concepts (TCs) in a large introductory undergraduate engineering course at a New Zealand university. As part of the flipped class intervention trialed over a three-week period, a series of short themed video lectures were developed as a replacement for the traditional weekly lectures. The weekly practical lab session were redesigned to incorporate small-group problem solving tasks and assessment. Data from student surveys, interviews, class observations, and video analytics were collected and analyzed. Findings revealed that students were familiar with online videos as a learning resource; they had positive past experiences with using them and were willing to participate in a flipped classroom. However, most students did not watch all assigned weekly videos, including ones crucial to their TC learning. There is indication they thought learning strategies involving interactions with real persons to be more useful to their learning. This suggests that current strategies for motivating students to access and engage with the prepared videos need to be revised to maximize students' learning opportunities.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2015.0,6,0,"{'url': 'https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstreams/2c4d459c-b6f8-44cd-b56d-43578db51981/download', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344139?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344139, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

658021384d3931ae73f911a5d4db1457e6eef13d,Optimal dosimeter deployment into a smart city IoT platform for wideband EMF exposure assessment,"LEXNET project, funded by the European Commission, is introducing new concepts for the assessment of the population EMF exposure. It also aims at evaluating the capability of future technologies to reduce this EMF exposure. The platform presented in this paper is an original tool for a continuous measurement of the multi-band downlink Electric Field strength at a scale of a city, relying on the SmartSantander sensor network that was developed in a previous project. The testbed integrates a new equipment to capture the E-field strength, i.e. connected dosimeters. The work that is reported here focuses on the deployment of those dosimeters in the city of Santander. The presented methodology uses both simulation and measurement to achieve an optimal design, i.e. a dosimeter deployment that provides relevant exposure statistics and allows for the creation of exposure maps. Results on the pre-deployment simulations are given in this document, while the complete design optimization will be demonstrated later in Year 2015.",European Conference on Networks and Communications,2015.0,5,0,"{'url': 'https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7259549/file/7259561.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'other-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194131?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194131, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In 2012 it projected to end the analog broadcasting in the end of year 2015. Presently our country is in that transition process and studying the possibility to implement SFN networks (Single Frequency Networks) for the ATSC Digital Television standard. Some options that are recommended to implement ATSC SFN networks are: Distributed Transmitters (DTxTs) and Digital On-Channel Repeaters (DOCRs). It is also recommended that the ATSC receivers have a robust equalizer able to recover the signal over long and strong echoes, and improve the design of receiving antennas. In this paper, we propose a planning of laboratory tests and field trials for ATSC operating in SFN in Mexico City, whose main objective is to evaluate the performance parameters for good reception in some of the existing commercial ATSC receivers in Mexico and, based on results, make recommendations for the optimal operating parameters of ATSC SFN networks.",IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications,2015.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/LATINCOM.2015.7430140?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/LATINCOM.2015.7430140, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Kits like these can expand access to hands-on experiences for online courses and to budget-strapped campuses. Although students like these kits, no previous studies compared student learning outcomes on assignments using these new kits with previous laboratory equipment. During the 2014-2015 academic year, we conducted a quasi-experiment to compare students' achievement of learning outcomes. Half of the laboratory sections in each semester used the existing equipment, while the other sections used the new kit.

There are many synergies and connections between these two disciplines. However, there have been very limited efforts to connect the two important disciplines. On the other hand, due to lack of mature techniques in privacy-preserving IR, concerns about information privacy and security have become serious obstacles that prevent valuable user data to be used in IR research such as studies on query logs, social media, tweets, and medical record retrieval. We propose this privacy-preserving IR workshop to connect the two disciplines of information retrieval and information privacy and security. We look forward to spurring research that aims to bring together the research fields of IR and privacy/security.

Purpose of this tutorial is to contribute to this learning process. We address medicine and healthcare; there the expertise of KDD scholars is needed and familiarity with medical research basics is a prerequisite.

Using ELTRAN techniques, a substrate could be prepared enabling any fab to simply integrate a monolithic 3D device without the need to change the current frontline fab process. This flow is further simplified and could be integrated with the game changing monolithic 3D flow introduced last year which leverages the emerging precision bonders, such as EVG's Gemini® XT FB. This flow provides a natural path for product innovation and an unparalleled competitive edge. In addition, this game-changer breakthrough offers a very cost competitive flow.",IEEE SOI-3D-Subthreshold Microelectronics Technology Unified Conference,2015.0,7,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/S3S.2015.7333537?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/S3S.2015.7333537, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As the Internet continuously grows, there have been challenges in keeping up with the demands on the DNS service. Recently, ICANN announced the introduction of new generic Top-level Domains (gTLDs). Using packet traces collected from a large edge network, we analyze the usage of TLDs between 2008 and 2015. We observe changes in usage of TLDs, and analyze the adoption of the new gTLDs announced by ICANN. We find that while there were no changes in the appearance of most frequently used TLDs, the presence of the new gTLDs in the datasets is growing. The number of different late new gTLDs appearing also doubled or tripled each year, implying that more and more people are starting to use these new gTLDs.",2015 IEEE 40th Local Computer Networks Conference Workshops (LCN Workshops),2015.0,7,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/LCNW.2015.7365915?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/LCNW.2015.7365915, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The zero-day attack period (ZDAP) is the period from the release of malware/exploit until a patch becomes available. IDS/IPS cannot effectively block zero-day attacks because they use pattern-based signatures in general. This paper proposes a Prophetic Defender (PD) by which ZDAP can be minimized. Prior to actual attack, hackers scan networks to identify hosts with vulnerable ports. If this port scanning can be detected early, zero-day attacks will become detectable. PD architecture makes use of a honeypot-based pseudo server deployed to detect malicious port scans. A port-scanning honeypot was operated by us in 6 years from 2009 to 2015. By analyzing the 6-year port-scanning log data, we understand that PD is effective for detecting and blocking zero-day attacks.

ee71855053a82eb7b45e5fee7e1a4698ca98d143,The role of collaborative inquiry in transforming faculty perspectives on use of reflection in engineering education,"During the 2014-2015 academic year, engineering faculty members and students at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) met monthly in a collaborative inquiry dialogue group to discuss the role of reflection in transforming engineering education. This project is part of the larger Consortium to Promote Reflection in Engineering Education (CPREE) headed by the University of Washington. In this paper we describe the activities of the Cal Poly group involved with CPREE and how these activities have transformed the thinking and actions of participants. Collaborative inquiry dialogue involves self-organizing individuals into a small group to address a compelling question through repeated cycles of experimentation and reflection on the results of that experimentation. In this context, the faculty members involved (including the authors of this paper) have been meeting to discuss how use of reflection in the classroom and/or in a collaborative inquiry dialogue amongst colleagues might lead to transformation in engineering education practice and outcomes. The dialogue group serves as a safe container that allows for the possibility of transformational insights by participants - insights that change their view of themselves, the world, and their relationship to it. Using a qualitative self-report methodology in the tradition of an action research paradigm, we (the authors) reflected on what we believed we had gained from the collaborative inquiry dialogues. Broadly we have noticed that participation in the collaborative inquiry dialogue has led us to reconsider what reflection is and what it could be, to develop a greater appreciation for the role of reflective practices in engineering education, and to better recognize when reflection is occurring (and when it might not be) such that reflective behaviors can be encouraged and practiced. We also began to challenge assumptions we had made about our teaching practices and have noted that the collaborative inquiry provides an environment in which development of new thinking is possible.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2015.0,5,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344183?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344183, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

85eff4b99eb1cd247ef1de44c8649fc14ec401cb,Proceedings of the 16th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing,"On behalf of the Technical Program Committee, we would like to welcome you to ACM MobiHoc 2015 in Hangzhou, China. 
 
ACM MobiHoc is the premier international symposium dedicated to addressing challenges emerging from wireless networking and computing. The highly selective technical program has traditionally brought together a unique blend of researchers and practitioners, thereby influencing the direction of a wide range of wireless networking research areas. We hope that you will find the conference intellectually stimulating. 
 
We are delighted to report that this year's program continues the tradition of excellence set by this conference over the years. We received 250 submissions, which has made it extremely challenging to select only 37 papers for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. At such a selective acceptance rate (14.8%) many of the papers that we could not accept are of high quality and we are certain that many of them will appear in the near future at other top-tier conferences. 
 
The paper selection process was handled by the Technical Program Committee (TPC). The TPC included 65 excellent members with expertise spanning all the major areas relevant to the conference scope. In particular, the TPC was composed of members from 16 countries and included 11 members from research labs and industry. 
 
The 250 submitted papers went through a first phase of reviews followed by a very active online discussion phase. Then, several papers went through a second review phase. The reviews were provided by the TPC members and, when needed, a few reviews were provided by external expert reviewers. At the end of this process and based on the results of the online discussion, 12 papers were accepted and 46 papers were further discussed at the TPC meeting that was held on Feb. 28, 2015 at Columbia University in New York. Following the discussions at the meeting, 25 additional papers were accepted. Ten of the accepted papers were assigned shepherds who volunteered to assist the authors during the process of preparing the final version. The work of the TPC was outstanding and we thank all the members for the time and efforts they dedicated to the paper selection process and to attending the meeting. These efforts make this wonderful conference possible. 
 
We are pleased with the strong technical program of the conference, represented by the papers in these proceedings. The conference program covers a wide range of topics, including routing, scheduling, algorithms, performance evaluation, dynamic spectrum access, cellular networks, sensor networks, mobile applications and crowdsensing, security, and wireless systems. 
 
This year's program is preceded by a set of seven workshops. It continues the tradition of having keynote talks from outstanding leaders in the field, and it includes a poster/demo session. The keynote speakers are Prof. Ness B. Shroff, the Ohio Eminent Scholar in Networking and Communications at The Ohio State University, Prof. Wen Gao, Vice President of the NSF of China, and Prof. Andrea Goldsmith, the Stephen Harris Professor in the School of Engineering, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.",ACM Interational Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing,2015.0,3,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/2746285?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/2746285, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

41f5f33b78069d2f889648bbdf220ab33012d836,Using POGIL Activities to Teach CS Principles to Diverse Students (Abstract Only),"As part of the new AAC&U TIDES initiative (TIDES: Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM), Westminster College has created a new computer science course for non-majors and paired it with a biology course as a first-year Learning Community. The new CS0 course relies heavily on culturally sensitive POGIL activities to be welcoming of all students, shifting to a more equitable, multicultural approach to CS curriculum and instruction. Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) is a student-centered learning approach that 1) assigns students to work in self-managed learning teams, 2) on specially designed guided inquiry materials, 3) while the instructor facilitates the development of process skills [1]. By requiring students to derive CS concepts for themselves while working together in learning teams, POGIL activities allow diverse student voices to be heard. They also provide a framework for instructors to act as ""guides on the side"" rather than ""sage on the stage"" for a large portion of class time. These CS Principles POGIL activities are among the first POGIL activities in any discipline to be deliberately designed to be culturally sensitive. In Fall 2015, CS instructors at four partner institutions will adopt these POGIL activities in their CS0 courses.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2015.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/2676723.2691909?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/2676723.2691909, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

370ca3f120cc60ba839c86808babbe5d9245e4e0,Profiling Japanese EST students' vocabulary ability using the New General Service List Test (NGSLT) and the New Academic Word List Test (NAWLT),"Understanding the vocabulary profiles of students is an important point for improving classroom-based pedagogy as well as materials development based on students' abilities and needs in ESP (English for Specific Purposes). As the second phase of a longitudinal research to assess Japanese university students' vocabulary competency, the researchers collected data on the performance of second and third-year students majoring in science and engineering on the New General Service List Test (NGSLT) and the New Academic Word List Test (NAWLT) developed by Phil Bennett and Tim Stoeckel in 2015 using words from the New General Service List 1.01 (NGSL 1.01) and the New Academic Word List (NAWL) developed by Charles Browne, Brent Culligan and Joseph Phillips in 2014. The NGSL 1.01 consists of 2,801 of the most frequently-appearing words in general use, and is a revision of the original General Service List (about 2,000 words) which was compiled by Michael West in 1953. The NWAL consists of 963 frequently-appearing words in academic text, and is a revision of the original Academic Word List (570 words) which was compiled by Averil Coxhead in 2000. Both the NGSLT and NAWLT are diagnostic tests of written receptive knowledge of the New General Service List and the New Academic Word List respectively. The NGSLT and NAWLT use the same specifications as the Vocabulary Size Test (VST) which was developed by Paul Nation and David Beglar in 2007, and have relatively good test reliability. This paper introduces the background about the tests, the participants in the study, and the data collection method. It also interprets the results of the collected scores, and discusses the implications of the results between departments and years. In future studies, the researchers hope to find ways to perceive the vocabulary abilities of students in their particular ESP fields. By doing so, they can be better informed providers of instruction and create materials tailored to students' particular needs.",International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems,2015.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICAMECHS.2015.7287103?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAMECHS.2015.7287103, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d6316e803d2e7f16a968a56a72d4390948df4909,"Engineering accreditation and professional competence in Ireland and Brazil: Similarities, differences and convergence in a global context","Context: The Brazil's `Ciência sem Fronteiras' (CsF) initiative has led to a phenomenal number of students from universities in Brazil experiencing engineering education in different parts of the world. Ireland has been very successful on a per capita basis of attracting CsF students with over 3,443 attending typically for a full academic year in the period 2013-2015. Purpose: While there are many benefits of the CsF initiative to all stakeholders, there are some important issues that have emerged. These include the direct relevance and usefulness of the engineering education experience gained while abroad. Credits gained in Ireland through the European Credits Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) are not necessarily recognised as part of the students' home degree programme in Brazil. This paper seeks to identify why this is the case and to propose some potential actions to enhance the mutual recognition of engineering education activities. Approach: The associated accreditation of engineering undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and routes to achieving legally recognised professional competence in Ireland and Brazil require some analysis and reflection. This paper outlines the current approaches to engineering education in both countries for degree and masters programmes, i.e. Bologna Cycles 1 and 2. It includes the alternative views on `inputs' such as the appropriate number of contact hours, and `outputs', such as the identification and attainment of learning outcomes and competences. Outcomes: The paper provides greater clarity on the similarities and differences between engineering education programmes in the two countries. The different roles that the governments and the relevant professional registration bodies take in directing the higher education institutions' engineering education programmes are also contrasted. Conclusions: The paper concludes with recommendations to facilitate improved mutual understanding and recognition between Ireland and Brazil in the context of facilitating global professional engineering practice.",International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning,2015.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICL.2015.7318146?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICL.2015.7318146, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e5dd0b78c8aaa933bf98d732780fe919b20d8ad9,Proceedings of the 46th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,"Welcome to SIGCSE 2015, the 46th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education. This year's symposium presents the latest advances in computer science education in a variety of formats: papers, posters, panels, special sessions, workshops, birds of a feather meetings, and, new this year, demonstrations and lightning talks. This year's symposium theme is ""Keep Connected. Keep Committed. Keep Computing."" We are asking our attendees to consider how they can use the conference to keep connected to each other and the field, to keep committed to the cause of computing education, and most fundamentally, to keep computing and to demonstrate to all our students how exciting this field truly is. 
 
We are delighted to have Jessica Hodgins of Carnegie Mellon University and Disney Research giving SIGCSE 2015's opening plenary address on Thursday. Her work at Carnegie Mellon and Disney Research will demonstrate what new and exciting things will keep us computing in the coming years. Keith Hampton of Rutgers University is speaking at our Saturday luncheon. His work in social media demonstrates how keeping us connected is an important part of building strong relationships. Finally, it is our pleasure to announce the recipients of the two annual SIGCSE awards, the recipients of which demonstrate keeping committed to the field of computing education and to the SIGCSE organization and community. Frank Young of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology will receive the SIGCSE Award for Lifetime Service to the Computer Science Education Community, and will speak at our First Timer's Lunch on Thursday. (SIGCSE First Timers will receive their lunch for free. SIGCSE Old Timers are encouraged to purchase a ticket, join us for lunch, meet some First Timers, and recognize Frank's contributions.) Mark Allen Weiss of Florida International University is the recipient of the SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education. Mark will give the plenary address on Friday. 
 
As noted above, we are very excited to be introducing two new tracks for SIGCSE 2015. A Demos track will be presented in the exhibit hall during breaks, and a session dedicated to Lightning Talks will take place on Friday afternoon at 3:45pm. 
 
Symposium statistics are presented in the following table. This year's program includes the usual wide selection of events, including the Evening Reception on Thursday and the ACM SIGCSE Student Research Competition, as well as another puzzle challenge. Our exhibit hall features a number of exhibitors showcasing the latest in hardware, software tools, textbooks and educational programs and research.

cd64d573b6e1701da363118f130ae9f48838d9bc,Reliable LED lighting technologies key factors and procurement guidance,"Lighting systems have the ability to transform the economic and educational infrastructure of disadvantaged communities, and eradicating “light poverty” has become one of the primary goals of the International Year of Light 2015. Solid-state lighting (SSL) technology, based on light-emitting diode (LED) light sources, has emerged as the next generation of lighting technology, with a current global market penetration of roughly 5%. This paper will report on recent research on understanding SSL lighting system reliability (failure modes, environmental stressors, electrical power quality); discuss the implications of SSL technology reliability for providing lighting services; and suggest practical approaches to ensure SSL reliability to benefit humanity. Among the key findings from this work is that LED sources can be extremely reliable, withstanding a broad range of environmental stresses without failure. Nonetheless, SSL lighting systems can have a negative impact on electrical power reliability, as well as on the affordability of lighting services, without attention to the quality of the accompanying power infrastructure. It is therefore critical to ensure that the performance of the power supply electronics used in lighting systems is matched to the quality of the power source, when evaluating energy efficient lighting choices.",IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference,2015.0,2,0,"{'url': 'https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1358568', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/GHTC.2015.7343972?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/GHTC.2015.7343972, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This innovative suite of software and hardware was initially designed for supporting the operations of multiple small satellites, but during its development, it evolved into a comprehensive system of systems that is capable of providing nearly all operations functions to support an integrated system of objects to be monitored and controlled, called nodes. These nodes are not limited to spacecraft, but can be almost any type of vehicle or electronic entity that has communication connectivity with the distributed COSMOS system. Even the vehicles themselves can operate COSMOS as their onboard controlling software. HSFL built a 55-kg satellite called Hiakasat that is due to launch on the ORS-4 mission in 2015. This satellite uses COSMOS for its onboard flight software, which integrates seamlessly with the COSMOS system that is being used to operate the mission on the ground. COSMOS is currently being used to monitor research ship gathering data, and even controlling rovers on simulated lunar missions. This innovative nodal architecture will allow a fully integrated system that can combine satellites with UAVs, submersible, ships, and other robotic craft.",International Conference on Recent Advances in Space Technologies,2015.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/RAST.2015.7208374?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/RAST.2015.7208374, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This year's technical program covers a wide and rich range of topics in mobile systems. The research themes include wearable computing, privacy and security, gaming, wireless networks, and more. 
 
We are delighted to anchor the technical program with keynote talks by Dr. Krishan Sabnani and Dr. Deborah Estrin. Drs. Sabnani and Estrin have been leading researchers in Internet design, wireless networks, and sensing for over twenty years. In addition to the keynotes, we have an exciting technical program that includes 29 full-length technical papers chosen by the technical program committee (TPC). 
 
This year, we had a record number of 219 submissions. To reduce the number of reviews each TPC member had to write, we augmented the TPC with an external review committee (ERC) of 30 experts. Most ERC members reviewed seven papers during the initial round of the review process. 
 
Our review process consisted of three rounds. In the first round, all submissions received three reviews, each written by a member of the TPC or ERC. If a reviewer recommended that a paper be accepted, the paper advanced to the second round. In the second round, papers received two or more additional reviews. At the end of the second round, reviewers discussed each remaining paper online to determine whether it should advance to the third round of decisions. The third round of decisions occurred during an all-day face-to-face meeting of the TPC. By the conclusion of this meeting, the TPC had identified the 29 papers in the program. Finally, all accepted papers were shepherded by a TPC member to ensure that the final manuscripts met the standards of the committee. We also took strict precautions throughout the review process to avoid conflicts of interest.","ACM SIGMOBILE International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services",2015.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/2742647?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/2742647, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

61207d431b06a9ffbdab96378f679c4c6bbe6736,Applying feedback to stock trading: Exploring a new field of research,"Nowadays, feedback control is everywhere and, affects everything. Recently, a novel idea of applying, feedback control to stock trading is proposed. Some, interesting results are published in recent IEEE/IFAC, control conferences. Different from current statistical or, artificial neural network based approaches, this opens a new, research field in analytical strategies for stock trading. In, this paper we follow the scheme of “Simultaneous Long-, Short feedback control” and carry out a new study. In our, study, instead of one feedback gain for both long and short, trading, different trading gains are applied. Based on recent, stock prices over one year (from 2014/3/27 to 2015/3/26), we show our selected simulation results for two stocks. One, is the Apple Incorporated stock. The trend of its price over, the year is increasing. The other is the NASDAQ-100 index, and the trend of its price is decreasing.

9803f4bbaefdc7ecab849df71d67aa95d02d52e8,Project Sanitarium: Gaming TB - A Serious Game for a Serious Problem,"Collaborative projects between Industry and Academia provide excellent opportunities for learning. Throughout the academic year 2014-2015 undergraduates from the School of Arts, Media and Computer Games at Abertay University worked with academics from the Infection Group at the University of St Andrews and industry partners Microsoft and DeltaDNA. The result was a serious game prototype that utilized game design techniques and technology to demystify and educate players about the diagnosis and treatment of one of the world's oldest and deadliest diseases, Tuberculosis (TB). Project Sanitarium is a game incorporating a mathematical model that is based on data from real-world drug trials. This paper discusses the project design and development, demonstrating how the project builds on the successful collaborative pedagogical model developed by academic staff at Abertay University. The aim of the model is to provide undergraduates with workplace simulation, wider industry collaboration and access to academic expertise to solve challenging and complex problems.",International Conference on Games and Virtual Worlds for Serious Applications,2015.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/VS-GAMES.2015.7295782?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/VS-GAMES.2015.7295782, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

UIST is the premier forum for the presentation of research innovations in the software and technology of human-computer interfaces. Sponsored by ACM's special interest groups on computer-human interaction (SIGCHI) and computer graphics (SIGGRAPH), UIST brings together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas including graphical & web user interfaces, tangible & ubiquitous computing, virtual & augmented reality, multimedia, new input & output devices, fabrication, wearable computing and CSCW. 
 
UIST 2015 received 297 technical paper submissions. After a thorough review process, the 39-member program committee accepted 70 papers (23.6%). Each anonymous submission that entered the full review process was first reviewed by three external reviewers, and a meta-review was provided by a program committee member. If, after these four reviews, the submission was deemed to pass a rebuttal threshold, we asked the authors to submit a short rebuttal addressing the reviewers' concerns. A second member of the program committee was then asked to examine the paper, rebuttal, and reviews, and to provide their own meta-review. The program committee met in person in Berkeley, California, USA on June 25th and 26th, 2015, to select which papers to invite for the program. Submissions were accepted only after the authors provided a final revision addressing the committee's comments. 
 
In addition to papers, our program includes two papers from the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction journal (TOCHI), as well as 22 posters, 45 demonstrations, and 8 student presentations in the eleventh annual Doctoral Symposium. Our program also features the seventh annual Student Innovation Contest. Teams from all over the world will compete in this year's contest, which focuses on blurring the lines between art and engineering and creating tools for robotic storytelling. UIST 2015 will feature two keynote presentations. The opening keynote will be given by Ramesh Raskar (MIT Media Lab) on extreme computational imaging. Blaise Aguera Y Arcas from Google will deliver the closing keynote on machine intelligence. 
 
We welcome you to Charlotte, a city full of southern hospitality. We hope that you will find the technical program interesting and thought-provoking. We also hope that UIST 2015 will provide you with enjoyable opportunities to engage with fellow researchers from both industry and academia, from institutions around the world.",ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology,2015.0,8,0,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/action/showFmPdf?doi=10.1145%2F2807442', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/2807442?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/2807442, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

089d0e71d516145c745428587d21b66e7514c25f,The clustering of high schools based on national and school examinations: A case study at Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Province,"The purpose of Indonesian National Examination for High School Students is to measure and assess students' knowledge and competence in particular subjects. The result is also going to be used as one of consideration for mapping Indonesia's national education quality. Aside from National Examination (NE), each school also conducts School Examination (SE). Both examinations are supposed to represent quality of education since the examinations measure the competence of the same students. However, the results of both examinations are not always linear [1]. In fact, the need of NE in Indonesian education is still being pro and cons among society. In order to identify whether NE and SE could be used to represent the quality of educations in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Province, this paper describes the analysis of NE and SE score by performing data mining technique using Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm towards NE score and SE score independently. Furthermore, the clusters were analyzed using univariate Anova, Spearman correlation, and crosstabulation. The data used in this research are NE and SE scores of Natural Science Department and Social Science Department of all high schools in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Province from academic year 2011/2012 to 2014/2015. The results of cluster analysis are three different clusters of NE in Natural Science Department, three different clusters of NE in Social Science Department, three different clusters of SE in Natural Science Department, and three different clusters of SE in Social Science Department for each year. The clusters are significantly separated. There is an opposite direction relationship between clusters of NE and SE. The relationship is weak which means there is no guarantee that a school which belongs to cluster-i of NE will be in the cluster-i of SE. Both for NE and SE memberships, only few members migrated from one cluster to another across years. The number of schools having the same cluster of NE and SE in each department varies from year to year, but generally less than 22%. The migrations of NE and SE cluster members from higher cluster to lower one and vice versa also vary. In addition, there is inconsistency clustering based on NE and SE. Since SE is not standardized and indeed is a formative test, there might be subjective aspects involved in grading the students. Therefore, if the government intends to map Indonesia's national education quality, national examination is more suitable than school examination for this purpose.",International Conference on Data and Software Engineering,2015.0,8,0,"{'url': 'http://repository.usd.ac.id/4038/1/2275_paperIcodse2015%2B-%2BPaulina%2BRosa%2Betal.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICODSE.2015.7437003?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICODSE.2015.7437003, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The analysis based upon the database of European Communication Monitor (ECM) 2007-2015 which is the largest study on strategic communication worldwide. The paper focuses on the development of communication channels, online communication and social media, furthermore tends to give an overall picture about the rapidly growing role of social media as a tool among European communication practitioners. This electronic document is a ""live"" template and already defines the components of your paper [title, text, heads, etc.] in its style sheet. In the frame of our paper we give an overview about the trends and long term features - such as digitalization, infocommunication, and social media - on communication management. What we can follow as clear trends during the 2007-2015 periods are as bellow: development of communication channels/instruments; coping with the digital evolution and the social web become the most important (strategic) issues for communication management; overall trend the interactive communication and online communities, and emerging interactive channels: social media, networks and online videos. There are phenomena which appear in a particular year and become a constant element of the tools by today, and there are new elements in every year. The importance of printed media is radically reduced, and replaced by online media. With their help will be the stakeholders, the media and the pubic available. Next to the online communication and online media, the forging ahead of social media (social networks, blogs, etc.) is the most important source of changes. The importance of to be present in social media is gradually becoming more and more obvious to companies. Social media means a real dialogue, and it requires substantial resources. As the World Wide Web becomes more and more influential, the global media become the most important tools of the global communication management on reaching the public.",IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications,2015.0,6,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/COGINFOCOM.2015.7390596?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/COGINFOCOM.2015.7390596, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c003ee7c2e4f28256eb445caf77ece001f021e74,Proceedings of the 39th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,"It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 34th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2015), held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, on May 31 -- June 4, 2015, in conjunction with the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data. Since the first edition of the symposium in 1982, the PODS papers are distinguished by a rigorous approach to widely diverse problems in data management, often bringing to bear techniques from a variety of different areas, including computational logic, finite model theory, computational complexity, algorithm design and analysis, programming languages, and artificial intelligence. The PODS Symposia study data management challenges in a variety of application contexts, including more recently probabilistic data, streaming data, graph data, information retrieval, ontology and semantic web, and data-driven processes and systems. PODS has a tradition of being the premier international conference on the theoretical and foundational aspects of mdata management, and the interested reader is referred to the PODS web pages at http://www.sigmod.org/thepods- pages/ for information on the history of this conference series. 
 
This year's symposium continues this tradition, but in addition the PODS Executive Committee decided to broaden the scope of PODS, and to explicitly invite for submission papers providing original, substantial contributions in one or more of the following categories: a) deep theoretical exploration of topical areas central to data management; b) new formal frameworks that aim at providing the basis for deeper theoretical investigation of important emerging issues in data management; and c) validation of theoretical approaches from the lens of practical applicability in data management. This volume contains the proceedings of PODS 2015, which include an abstract for the keynote address by Michael I. Johnson (University of California, Berkeley), papers based on two invited tutorials by Todd J. Green (LogicBlox, USA) and Graham Cormode (University of Warwick, UK), and 25 contributions that were selected by the Program Committee for presentation at the symposium. 
 
This year, PODS experimented for the first time with two submission cycles, where the first cycle allowed also for papers to be revised and resubmitted. For the first cycle, 29 papers were submitted, 4 of which were directly selected for inclusion in the proceedings, and 7 were invited for a resubmission after a revision. The quality of most of the revised papers increased substantially with respect to the first submission, and 6 of those in the end were selected for the proceedings. For the second cycle, 51 papers were submitted, 15 of which were selected, resulting in 25 papers selected overall from a total number of 80 submissions. Most of the 25 accepted papers are extended abstracts. While all submissions have been reviewed by at least four Program Committee members, they have not been formally referred. It is expected that much of the research described in these papers will be published in a more polished and detailed form in scientific journals. 
 
With respect to the three categories mentioned above, of the 80 submissions (resp., 25 accepted papers), 47 (resp., 19) were classified by the authors in category (a), 28 (resp., 5) in category (b), and only 6 (resp., 3) in category (c). The categories are non-exclusive, and classification was not mandatory; indeed, several papers were classified in more than one category, and for 13 (resp., 3) submissions, no category was specified. 
 
An important task for the Program Committee has been the selection of the PODS 2015 Best Paper Award. The committee selected the paper ""Parallel-Correctness and Transferability for Conjunctive Queries"" by Tom J. Ameloot, Gaetano Geck, Bas Ketsman, Frank Neven and Thomas Schwentick 
 
On behalf of the committee, we would like to extend our sincere congratulations to the authors. Since 2008, PODS assigns the ACM PODS Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award to a paper or a small number of papers published in the PODS proceedings ten years prior that had the most impact over the intervening decade. This year's committee, consisting of Dan Suciu (chair), Foto Afrati, and Frank Neven, selected the following two papers. Our warmest congratulations to their authors!

cf09fd5240dca36f5d2526ff6321f91891333abd,A Novel Framework for Analysis of Global Network Neutrality Based on Packet Loss Rate,"Network neutrality is a policy made by the government. It emphasizes that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should treat all users equally, regardless of users' behavior, as long as they are legal. In this sense, it aims to build a fair and healthy network. Packet Loss Rate (PLR) is an important metric to evaluate a network's condition. In this paper, we compare PLR of two different kinds of tests, which are ""speedtest"" and ""bittorrent"", to judge network neutrality of ISPs. The difference of PLR of two tests is used to evaluate the level of network neutrality violations. We propose a general framework for analysis of network neutrality. First, by transforming the well-known Mathis model, we build a model that uses public data, collected by the network neutrality bot (Neubot), to estimate the PLR of countries all over the world. Second, a composite function model, named PECF, is proposed for fitting to get the lower limit of PLR (L-PLR). When the value of PLR is L-PLR, the frequencies of PLR of two tests differ most and a network neutrality violation appears. By mathematical inference, we draw the conclusion that ISPs violate network neutrality when PLR is larger than 0.10. Third, based on this conclusion, we concentrate on the case when PLR is larger than 0.10 to study network neutrality violations. We use R-PLR (Ranged PLR) to describe PLR within a certain range. By comparing the PLR of ""speedtest"" with that of ""bittorrent"" within a certain R-PLR, we further determine the level of network neutrality violation in time and space. Network neutrality violation is more likely to happen under network peaks. The geographical distribution of PLR shows China (CN) and South Africa (ZA) suffer the most severe network neutrality violations among the eight regions studied. Finally, we present the histogram of PLR worldwide from year 2012 to 2015, which shows a relationship between network development and user demand.",International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data,2015.0,5,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CCBD.2015.10?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CCBD.2015.10, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9dd316db2e367a1aa7bf0de0b98e1aed1e8df7df,A web tool for assessing the energy use of buildings in Greece: First results from real life application,"Nowadays, cities are key to meet sustainability objectives in the European Union. Almost 75% of European habitants live in cities and the majority of cities authorities have committed to increase energy efficiency by improving buildings, equipment and facilities' performance. Actually, about 35% of the EU's buildings are over 50 years old and by improving the energy efficiency of buildings, the total EU energy consumption can be reduced by 5% to 6% and lower CO2 emissions by about 5%. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to present an online web tool, for improving the energy performance of existing buildings in Greece based on the actual energy use. The application is able to collect real energy consumption data and provide, with a user friendly way, a toolset which calculates energy savings from a list of improvement scenarios. The online software calculates automatically the economic viability of the chosen actions. The web tool has been tested in different buildings in Greece and it is developed using open source software and programming languages such as PHP and MySQL. The application has been developed by the Decision Support Systems Laboratory (DSS), of the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). The web tool has been used from the students of NTUA for the academic year 2014-2015, resulting in a number of completed case studies. The main outcomes from the 1st year of the web tool's real life application are summarised in the paper, offering useful results about the energy building capacity in the capital of Greece.","International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications",2015.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IISA.2015.7387977?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IISA.2015.7387977, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

47d167a65f007a0148bc1958c241df3d20e7f943,ENGAGE: A Game-based Learning Environment for Middle School Computational Thinking,"We present ENGAGE, a game-based learning environment for teaching computational thinking to middle school students. This project has dual aims: introducing computational thinking practices to students at a young age, and improving computational thinking attitudes among underrepresented students. In pursuit of these two goals, the ENGAGE team has mapped the learning objectives of the AP CS Principles course to the middle school level, and then built an immersive game experience upon that foundation. Students choose computer scientist avatars to represent themselves, and then play in pairs as they investigate a data-related mystery in an underwater research station, solving computational thinking challenges along the way. ENGAGE is currently being implemented as part of a quarterly elective in four middle schools in North Carolina. During the elective, students spend a total of ten classroom sessions playing the game, supplemented by ""unplugged"" activities that reinforce concepts learned in the game environment. We plan to expand to more middle schools in the 2015-2016 school year. In this demo, members of the SIGCSE community will be able to experience the ENGAGE game for themselves and learn more about its development and future directions. We will also discuss our success in recruiting and teaching the ENGAGE curriculum to middle school teachers who had no prior computer science experience, and the success of those middle school teachers in implementing ENGAGE within their classrooms.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2015.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/2676723.2691876?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/2676723.2691876, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4fd60a21ea7810dd45f57193073be0e4940c48ae,Decoding CS Principles: A Curriculum from Code.org (Abstract Only),"Code.org is developing a complete curriculum and professional development program for the new (AP) Computer Science Principles course. In this hands-on workshop, modeled after the professional development program, participants will get access to, and interact with the new curricular materials for this course: daily lesson plans, instructional guides, assessments, and custom-built software tools woven throughout. Code.org's CS Principles curriculum engages students by having them invent and create their own solutions to some of the great problems in computing upon which many CS principles are based. For example, the course begins by asking students to invent their own bit-sending device to send a single bit of information from one place to another. The curriculum employs a variety of instructional strategies, plugged and unplugged, to build a classroom experience that is engaging and emphasizes accessibility for both the students and instructors. The curriculum also emphasizes student preparation for the AP Performance Tasks by including model tasks at the conclusion of each unit of study. Participants will experience a snapshot of the professional development program, engaging with lessons from the curriculum as they would in a realistic classroom context (i.e. diving into the materials and planning to teach the lesson rather than just talking about it). Participants will hear from high school teachers who have taught the lessons in their classrooms during the 2014-15 field-testing year.

Unfortunately, wheat crop is always under attack by diseases in which 100 diseases are caused by pathogens and others are due to weeds and different parasites. Mostly rust diseases are air-borne and soil-borne. Foliar rust diseases; yellow/stripe rust, brown/leaf rust, powdery mildew and tan spot infect different parts of plants thus taking high toll of crop yield. This study focused on selected fields of Chakwal district while comparing the disease incidence data for six years (2010-2015). Variation in Climatic Data including Temperature, precipitation and humidity were analyzed for past six years because these variations are responsible for development of rust diseases. Mycotoxin risk assessment tool was used to assess the risk of Fusarium mycotoxins in wheat. Hotspot tool assesses clustering of high and low values thus used to identify hot and cold spots of rust diseases (leaf and stripe rust) in selected fields. Standard deviational ellipses showed the extent of variation of diseases exhibiting the directional trend for past six years. The results demonstrated in the form of maps showed shift of diseases from one region to another depending on the climatic variation.

b6abd946998b87677cf0cf0b3ad72ba257de3b8b,Power supply of a rural off-grid health center — A case study,"Presently, more than 7 million Haitians have no access to power nor basic energy related services. Available generation capacity of Haiti reaches 212 MW, which is insufficient to meet the estimated peak demand of more than 500 MW in the whole country. This deficit severely impacts basic essential facilities such as health care centers. The IEEE Student Branch PES Chapter at Georgia Tech established a project to design and implement a microgrid to supply power to a recently established health center in the mountains of Thoman, Haiti. Several combinations of power generating units were evaluated on an economic basis, including: a standalone diesel generator (DG), photovoltaic (PV) panels with batteries, and PV panels with batteries and a DG. Key parameters including power rating, daily energy production, maximum annual capacity shortage, etc., were also incorporated into the economic evaluation. This paper outlines the preliminary microgrid design steps, assessment of topology alternatives, site visit, detailed design and the fundraising process. Only commercial off-the-shelf parts were considered for device selection. To verify the preliminary design, a site visit was conducted in February 2015.

afc7bc947ea7dbb5b30348992a901c711b56483c,The Evolving Process to Add Preservation Support for New Formats at Harvard Library,"In 2000 Harvard Library began populating the Digital Repository Service (DRS), its digital preservation repository, with digitized text, images and audio. Over the years the Library continued to add preservation support to the DRS for new formats including born digital websites, PDF documents and email. Library collections however continued to grow and diversify to include a wide range of formats not supported by the DRS, including video and a variety of born-digital formats. In 2013 the Library began to bridge that preservation support gap by refining the process of how new formats are supported in the DRS. This paper describes the new process, which is a more consistent workflow and includes external expertise; as well as analysis tools that could be used by other institutions to broaden the range of digital formats that they are able to preserve. Introduction Over the last decade the collections at Harvard Library have diversified to include content in many different analog and digital formats. While preservation solutions exist for the more “traditional” analog and digital formats at Harvard, much of the media-based collections and born-digital material is at risk. The media collections, on VHS, mini-DV, U-matic video tapes, and many other carrier formats are at risk primarily because of media degradation and because much of the playback technology is now obsolete. The born-digital material is at similar risk of permanent loss for many reasons, but primarily because of format obsolescence, lost or corrupt bits, and lack of metadata and documentation needed to interpret the bits. Curators and collection managers at Harvard have requested that many of these media and born-digital formats be supported by the Library’s digital preservation repository, the Digital Repository Service (DRS). Support for new formats has been added to the DRS on an almost continuous basis since it was launched in 2000, but not fast enough to keep up with all of the demands (see Figure 1). To prevent permanent loss, the Library needed to speed up the process for adding support for new formats to the DRS. This problem is not unique to Harvard. This is a reflection of the Information Age we live in where content now routinely comes in many different formats, from a variety of creators. If collecting institutions everywhere do not already have this problem, they will soon need to determine how to go beyond preserving wellunderstood digitized content to include the more complex media and born-digital formats. Figure 1. This graph shows the percentage of requests for DRS support for various formats made by Harvard curators and collection managers since 2004 for which there still was not preservation support in 2014. Almost a quarter of the requests have been for video formats, while there is a long tail of requests to support many other formats. What is a Supported Format in the DRS? All content preserved in the DRS conforms to one of twenty content models, for example Still Image, Audio, Document and Email Message. Each content model prescribes preferred and accepted formats, valid relationships between the object’s files and to other objects, associated metadata schemas, delivery applications and associated preservation plans. Two content models allow files in any format Opaque and Opaque Container. The main difference between the two is that the files of Opaque Container objects are aggregated into compressed zip files while the files of Opaque objects are left as separate files. Although these two content models allow for any file format to be deposited to the DRS, it is not considered that the DRS supports all formats because these files receive only bit-level preservation. Their disposition as opaque is considered to be temporary, until sometime in the future when the formats can be fully supported directly or as a result of a migration. A format is “supported” by the DRS when preservation staff are reasonably confident that material in this format can be used now and that it can be made usable on an ongoing basis through preservation interventions. It requires policy and strategy decisions, the provision of guidelines and often tool development and enhancements. Supported formats can be deposited to the DRS, can be managed within a DRS administrative interface and can be delivered for use by researchers through Library-maintained APIs and delivery tools. 12 © 2015 Society for Imaging Science and Technology Specifically it requires the provision of specifications to collection managers and DRS depositors on the formats that are preferred and acceptable; content creation guidelines, for example, do not use encryption; and instructions on metadata or documentation that should accompany the content. All of this necessarily needs to be backed up by research and analysis. It also requires that the DRS tools accurately understand the new format and support any technical metadata schemas or elements that are adopted for the format. The DRS deposit and management tools must accept and understand the format. Most importantly, discovery and delivery systems must exist for the format; otherwise the content cannot be used by researchers. Before this project, it often took a great deal of time to add new formats to the DRS for several reasons. All of the analysis and development work was done by existing in-house preservation and IT staff who were also working on other projects and ongoing operations concurrently. Because the format support work was intermittent as time allowed, some time was lost to refamiliarization with the work, and the overall completion time was longer than if it had been uninterrupted. If preservation staff were unfamiliar with the formats or associated metadata, time would need to be spent on research as a first step before any other progress could be made. In addition, the overall process for adding new formats was somewhat ad-hoc and largely designed from scratch each time new formats were added. New Approach To make significant headway on adding preservation support for the most requested formats, a three-year project to fast-track support was launched with the support of the Arcadia Foundation. The formats were scoped to include video, office formats (word processing, spreadsheets and presentations), 2D vector formats including CAD, Adobe DNG raw camera images and 3D formats. A few formats that had not been formally requested were included for strategic reasons: disk images and image stacks. To support all these formats within three years the Library’s format support process needed to be transformed into a routine that was much faster and could easily be repeated. At a high-level the approach was to separate the preliminary analysis tasks from the software development work into two different sub-projects because they required different knowledge and skills. For any format, the analysis could be done as soon as expertise was available so that the specifications were already waiting when developer resources became available. In this way the analysis and implementation could be staggered in a way that was more efficient than trying to line up the staff resources needed for all of the analysis and development at one time. Another significant change was that external consultants with specialized format expertise were sought to help preservation staff with the analysis. Besides temporarily increasing the pool of preservation expertise, it had several other benefits. If a consultant could be identified who already had the right format expertise, there was no lag time needed for the up-front format research. Also, having to specify to a consultant the analysis tasks and desired deliverables required preservation staff to clearly define the overall analysis framework in a way that could be repeated for other formats. And most importantly the analysis work for different formats could be done in parallel (provided that multiple different consultants were used), so that the elapsed time was shorter. As a result of these changes the overall methodology for adding support for new formats was made more consistent and efficient. Results An immediate result of this project is that the Library is able to make substantial progress in addressing the backlog of format support requests. By adding support for the video and born-digital formats described earlier, sixty-four percent of the preservation support requests will be addressed by the end of this three-year project. Many of these formats, such as CAD and 3D object models, are very complex and few if any institutions are confident preserving content in these formats [1]. The Library will share its format, metadata and tool decisions on its public website so that this information will be available to other institutions. In addition, because the workflow and analysis tools that were developed might also be of interest to other institutions, those are described here. Workflow At an operational level the Library now has a clear and repeatable workflow for adding support for new formats to the DRS. Table 1 lists the workflow’s analysis and implementation tasks. In general the tasks are sequential but they are discrete enough that they can be distributed among internal staff and external consultants. The first task is to decide which tasks will be done internally or by consultants or by a combination, depending on in-house expertise and the ability to identify external experts. Table 2 shows how the analysis tasks were distributed among internal staff and consultants for each format group.

The programming languages Java, C/C++, Python and Prolog are supported. In a code magnet lab the student is presented with a sequence of possible code magnets that can be arranged using drag-and-drop to create the desired method. Magnets for control statements can nest other magnets, including nested control statements. The completed method is compiled and subject to unit testing. Test results guide students towards a correct solution; multiple submissions are allowed. Since there is no keyboard entry when using code magnet labs, the labs can be completed using laptops, desktops, tablets and other mobile devices. This workshop is a shorter version of the half-day workshop presented with support from three NSF grants. Participants will experience using existing labs and learn to build their own code magnet lab for Java, Python, C or Prolog (participant's choice). Significant stipends averaging about $1000 will be available for after-workshop activities where the participant develops and tests multiple code magnet labs for his/her own courses in the 2014-2015 academic year.

a4f55a6d9c7201be44c1b384f3e61805823b4a90,Possibilities to quantify the road traffic on the national road network and motorways in Romania,"Abstract As a result of the economic crisis of 2009-2010, the road traffic on the national road network, for the period 2011-2014, decreased considerably. Thus, the evolution coefficients, for the period 2020-2025, registered a trend of decrease in road traffic. Based on the analysis of the results of the automatic traffic records, it was found that the average daily average traffic increased by about 4.7% in 2016 compared to 2015 (the year of the last general circulation census) and is in continuous growth, one of the reasons being removal of car registration tax. In 2015, for the development of evolution coefficients and the rates of evolution of traffic on the national road network, the linear regression method was used which took into account both the evolution of road traffic reported in 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010, as well as the evolution of road traffic on the traffic counters network for the period 2010-2015. The paper analyzes aspects of the efficiency of the method used until the present and the need to develop coefficients and rates of evolution based on more complex methods, based on several economic and social indicators, including the projected evolution of GDP.",Proceedings of the International Conference on Applied Statistics,2019.0,0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/icas-2019-0036', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2478/icas-2019-0036?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2478/icas-2019-0036, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

00dbdc4827cf3feae58f5c874f282440ffd0657c,Status of the assessment phase of the ESA M3 mission candidate LOFT,"LOFT (Large Observatory For x-ray Timing) is one of four candidates for the M3 slot (launch in 2024, with the option of a launch in 2022) of ESAs Cosmic Vision 2015 – 2025 Plan, and as such it is currently undergoing an initial assessment phase lasting one year. The objective of the assessment phase is to provide the information required to enable the down selection process, in particular: the space segment definition for meeting the assigned science objectives; consideration of and initial definition of the implementation schedule; an estimate of the mission Cost at Completion (CaC); an evaluation of the technology readiness evaluation and risk assessment. The assessment phase is divided into two interleaved components: (i) A payload assessment study, performed by teams funded by member states, which is primarily intended for design, definition and programmatic/cost evaluation of the payload, and (ii) A system industrial study, which has essentially the same objectives for the space segment of the mission. This paper provides an overview of the status of the LOFT assessment phase, both for payload and platform. The initial focus is on the payload design status, providing the reader with an understanding of the main features of the design. Then the space segment assessment study status is presented, with an overview of the principal challenges presented by the LOFT payload and mission requirements, and a presentation of the expected solutions. Overall the mission is expected to enable cutting-edge science, is technically feasible, and should remain within the required CaC for an M3 candidate.",Other Conferences,2012.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1117/12.925976?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1117/12.925976, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3fa6ec547617c5a2c8a7ab48f57f177e0cedc0b7,My Fifteen Year Journey of Deploying FPGA Accelerated Solutions,"While FPGAs have been investigated for accelerating computing workloads in academia for many decades, industry started adopting FPGAs as an accelerator only in the last decade, but even those deployments have been fairly limited. This talk describes my journey over 15 years of building and deploying FPGA accelerated solutions. In my career, I have led the integration of FPGAs with CPUs in a variety of ways, each seeking the right mix of efficiency, capability, and cost. The first phase of the journey begins at Intel in 2008 in building the first solutions with socketed FPGAs attached to Xeon CPUs using FSB and QPI coherent buses. These coherently attached FPGAs enabled various new use cases beyond the PCIe attached FPGA accelerators leading to projections of wide scale deployment of FPGAs in the data center. Intel's acquisition of Altera in 2015 kicked off the second phase where we integrated a FPGA die with a Xeon die to produce a multi-chip package that dropped into a Xeon socket. This was introduced in the market targeting communication workloads. We formed Megh Computing in 2017 to enable a FPGA accelerated edge platform for analytics workloads in the enterprise which resulted in solutions for video surveillance. The talk will discuss the various challenges and breakthroughs in deploying FPGA accelerators from the edge to the datacenter, where I see the market headed in the near future and identify promising directions and tough problems the FPGA research community need to tackle to realize the potential of reconfigurable computing.",Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Arrays,2024.0,0,0,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3626202.3644813', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3626202.3644813?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3626202.3644813, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3465e2b594089c13a474f1991069cae26681247e,Staying Ahead of the Curve: Early Prediction of Academic Probation among First-Year CS Students,"Application processes in higher education, particu-larly in fields like Computer Science (CS), have become more competitive in recent years. Additionally, at the University of California, Irvine (U CI), 57 % of students who were admitted and enrolled in the CS program between Fall 2011 and Fall 2015 failed to maintain satisfactory academic standing and entered academic probation. Of these probation students, 41 % entered probation during their first year. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using machine learning tools to identify the academic probation status of first-year CS students at an early stage, with the ultimate aim of providing timely support to those who are at the greatest risk of entering academic probation. We trained various classifiers on a dataset containing demo-graphic and academic performance variables for CS students at U CI, and performed feature analysis to identify the most influential variables. Since it is our priority to identify students who enter academic probation, our focus was on maximizing recall. The best-performing classifiers were Linear Support Vector Machines (recall of 0.838) and Logistic Regression (recall of 0.812). Our feature analysis revealed that ethnicity, student region, and having taken the Advanced Placement CS exam had a greater impact on the classification task than GPA and summer course enrollment. Future work could focus on expanding the dataset to include academic data available after enrollment to improve our current results. Our findings could also be applied to assess their impact in strategies for student retention in CS. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential for machine learning tools to assist in identifying at-risk students in CS, and highlights the importance of considering a range of demographic and academic variables in this process.",2023 3rd International Conference on Applied Artificial Intelligence (ICAPAI),2023.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICAPAI58366.2023.10194020?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAPAI58366.2023.10194020, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b1c39ddad9eb72d7ba59b65ef8d5f43c7c850927,Predicting the stock market index using GRU for the year 2020,"Predicting the behavior of the stock exchange is crucial, since it ranks as one of the foremost frequently studied fields nowadays. It is challenging to forecast the financial sector that requires a careful analysis of historical trends. The precision of conventional methods for predicting changes in stock prices was insufficient. In order to anticipate the values of stocks, deep learning becomes particularly popular technique. Deep Learning is a particularly popular method for anticipating stock prices because of the efficiency in patterns that are not linear. Recurrent neural networks were used to increase prediction accuracy since share price movements are dependent on sequence of time. Within Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), their pivotal strength lies in their adeptness at managing sequential data and grasping offered a distinct challenge as well as a chance to investigate sophisticated forecasting algorithms. Nonlinear stock price movements cannot be accurately predicted by traditional data analytics approaches. Owing to its effectiveness in capturing intricate, nonlinear patterns within time-series data, deep learning stands out as the predominant method employed for predicting stock prices. A 25% drop in global stock prices and a 30% reduction in G20 countries market prices were recorded in March 2020. Many businesses experience significant losses, and it may be very challenging for them to recover. While many stockholders suffered losses, several businesses managed to continue making money throughout this period. whether the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model, exhibits superior predictive capabilities for significant fluctuations in stock prices during the year 2020 compared to the LSTM model. This research involves a comparative analysis between GRU and LSTM using diverse stock indices, with historical data sourced from the Yahoo Finance API. Notably, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values demonstrate that GRU outperforms LSTM in forecasting accuracy. The MAPE values for our proposed approach are 1.09, 1.36, 1.43, 0.89, 1.52, and 1.76 for NSE, BSE, Dow Jones, NYSE, S&P, and NASDAQ form January 2015 to March 2020.",Educational Sciences International Conference,2024.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ESIC60604.2024.10481534?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ESIC60604.2024.10481534, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fba7545df4d6bc2b12787863236fbc72e2c7caee,Academic Success Skills in First-Year Chemical Engineers: A Before and After Look at the Pandemic,"The introductory chemical engineering course for first-year undergraduate students at the University of Rochester includes workshops focused on building success skills to help students persist academically in the major. The instructor of these workshops has administered Landis' Academic Success Skills Survey during the fall semester since 2015, including Fall 2020, to better understand how the workshop activities and assignments contribute to students' academic success as future chemical engineers. In this Innovative Practice Full Paper, we compare students' pre-post course results related to self-perceived improvements in their academic success skills between the Fall 2019 semester (a regular in-person semester) and the Fall 2020 semester (a hybrid remote/socially-distanced semester). In Fall 2020, students' normalized gains in overall perception of their success skills were larger, students perceived more statistically significant improvements on individual success skills, students attributed more of their improvements to the course itself, and students' opinion of the University remained constant compared to Fall 2019 (i.e., the hybrid semester did not result in a more negative attitude about the University). Students also self-reported feeling a sense of community with their peers and faculty in the course, which indicates that the course may have been a vital cornerstone not only to students' overall academic careers in chemical engineering, but also to their resilience in the face of a uniquely challenging semester during a global pandemic. Based on these results, we offer detailed descriptions of the activities and assignments of the workshops for other first-year engineering instructors to consider for their own courses moving forward.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2021.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637473?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637473, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It was deployed in late 2012, became the fastest supercomputer in the world and was retired on August 2, 2019. With Titan’s mission complete, this paper provides a first-order examination of the usage of its critical resources (CPU, Memory, GPU, and I/O) over a five-year production period (2015–2019). In particular, we show quantitatively that the majority of CPU time was spent on the large-scale jobs, which is consistent with the policy of driving ground-breaking science through leadership computing. We also corroborate the general observation of the low CPU-memory usage with 95% jobs utilizing only 15% or less available memory. Additionally, we correlate the increase of total job submissions and the decrease of GPU-enabled jobs during 2016 with the GPU reliability issue which impacted the large-scale runs. We further show the surprising read/write ratio over the five-year period, which contradicts the general mindset of the large-scale simulation machines being “write-heavy”. This understanding will have potential impact on how we design our next-generation large-scale storage systems.

6d00e2ea8409eb241f7761203fe3869fd4b0aaa4,Understanding similarities and differences in students across first-year computing majors,"In November 2014, Michigan Technological University's departments of computer science (CS) and electrical and computer engineering (ECE) were selected to participate in NCWIT's Extension Services for Undergraduate Programs (ES-UP). ES-UP, supported by NSF and Google, is designed to help departments develop strategies to recruit and retain women in computing and engineering majors. Both departments have enrolled a low number of women in their programs and have had lower retention rates than other departments on campus. As part of the ES-UP initiatives, we surveyed our first-year students in Fall 2015 and followed up with a second survey in January 2016. The goal of the initial survey was to learn what attracted students to their major while the second focused on their experiences during their first semester. Examination of the students across the four majors in the two departments in separate colleges provides a unique perspective on students' attraction to and persistence in computing-related majors.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2016.0,9,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757695?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757695, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

40b8cc89515c73090291fb8c6f42a97c58ef67e5,Enhancing the mathematics capability of first-year information technology students at a University of Technology in South Africa,"First-year IT students enrolled in the Higher Certificate in Information and Communication Technology programme at the UoT where this study was conducted are expected to have passed either Mathematics or Mathematics Literacy in their final matric examinations. However, the mathematics performance of many first-year IT freshmen enrolled in the HCINCT programme in 2015 was lower than the mathematical capabilities of current 11-to 12-year-old pupils attending Grade 6 in a South African primary school. This claim was based on the researcher’s analysis of the students’ pre-test and post-test scores. This study investigated the efficacy of the enhancement of the mathematics capability intervention programme known as the Higher Certificate in Information and Communication Technology. The main research question of the study was: What is the effect of the intervention programme on the mathematical knowledge of IT students upon entry into the HCINCT programme? The intervention was administered in 2015 to 147 information technology freshmen through class tutorials in the subject of Quantitative Techniques. Quantitative methods instruments were used to collect analyse and present data. To find answers to the main research question, hypotheses were constructed based on historical data. The null hypothesis (Ho) claimed that there was no statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the groups before and after the mathematics capability intervention (the treatment). A paired sampled t-test method befitted the nature of the hypotheses and the data collected. The descriptive statistics results suggested that there is a strong probability that the students’ mathematical capabilities increased by chance.","International Conference on Research in Business, Management and Finance",2019.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.33422/icrbmf.2019.07.1015?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.33422/icrbmf.2019.07.1015, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8ee7f88533dc9e68af756a268f94c5704df07ea5,Improving Student Engagement and Performance in Computing Final Year Projects,"There has been a seismic shift in the UK higher education landscape during the last decade. This has been driven by the formation of the Office for Students (OfS) and the introduction of the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), where the emphasis has been on programmes offering students higher value when it comes to employability, retention and overall student experience. One of the critical challenges that impacts student experience is being able to enhance student engagement within a learning environment. Final year individual projects, which are generally unstructured in nature, is a significant contributor to programmes of study, yet remains an area where this problem is exacerbated. In an attempt to address this issue, our earlier work lays the foundation for a teaching & learning framework covering computing final year projects. In this paper, we present an extension to the framework and its implementation in 2016/17 following its first trial run within a Computer Science department at a UK university in 2015/16. We discuss the two implementations in practice and provide operational guidance. A large-scale longitudinal empirical study considering the performance of 625 final year undergraduate students over a period of five years is presented to ascertain the effectiveness of the framework. The study finds a consistent and significant positive impact on both student performance and engagement as a result of the original framework and further gains from the enhancements.","International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering",2019.0,0,0,"{'url': 'https://repository.uel.ac.uk/download/6fbd48f5a14052f50eeb941e612db74db3a8e26234fca0b32bd63af4a55f7911/1403764/Improving%20Student%20Engagement%20and%20Performance%20in%20Computing%20Final%20Year%20Projects%20Accepted%20Arish.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/TALE48000.2019.9225860?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/TALE48000.2019.9225860, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6fd96f5472682a15c33f525620fec627ee5bd120,What do first-year engineers and others consider cheating?,"This paper reports student responses to a short survey presented within the first few weeks to a variety of first-term students including both engineers and non-engineers. Survey results for first-year engineering students from 2014 (NEng2014 = 85) have previously been reported [1] and were included in this analysis. In 2015, an additional one hundred and seven engineering students (NEng2015 = 103), thirty-eight nursing students (NNur = 38), and sixty-four biology students (NBio = 63) completed the same survey. The purpose of this survey was to build a dialog between faculty and students regarding ethical classroom behavior and to gain further insight into student attitudes regarding activities that may or may not be considered cheating. Students were anonymously asked to rank their level of agreement with eleven statements related to working with others on assignments, using solution materials for homework, and appropriate behavior for exams including the use of technology. After analysis indicated that the two engineering groups were not statistically different, the 2014 engineering group was combined with the 2015 engineering group. The results of these student surveys have been used to guide continuous improvement of the engineering program and will inform efforts to address ethical topics for future discussions campus-wide.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2016.0,3,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757435?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757435, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Despite the relatively advanced state of FinTech investment services in Indonesia, it falls short in comparison to the advancements observed in several other countries (Africa, Malaysia, China, and the United States). Projections indicate a substantial 10% growth in the FinTech sector in Africa in the year 2025. Previous studies have identified key financial factors, such as Financial Literacy, Financial Knowledge, and Financial Risk, as well as the significant issue of E-Trust, which collectively influence individuals' decisions to engage with investment FinTech. This research employed quantitative methods. The data involved a total of 420 respondents. The study reveals that Financial Risk holds a modest influence of 14.8% on the actual use of FinTech, underscoring the need for improvement in addressing financial risk. The hedonism factor emerges as a crucial element in FinTech investment, emphasizing the importance of enhancing users' awareness regarding pertinent aspects such as Financial Literacy, Financial Risk, and E-Trust. Surprisingly, in terms of Perceived Benefits, users do not predominantly consider perceived benefits when utilizing FinTech. This discovery holds valuable insights for supporting the advancement of the FinTech application industry.",International Conference on Smart Computing and Communication,2024.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICSCC62041.2024.10690617?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCC62041.2024.10690617, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c7d3cbcdb2db8acb877da2fee9ee2d45efc67b6e,TransVOD: Transformer-Based Visual Object Detection for Self-Driving Cars,"Detection of the objects using various models and technologies is performed within the domain of computer vision. This has an application in the medical industry, automation, and self-driving car industries, among many others. It is predicted that by the year 2025 there will be over 8 million self-driving cars running on roads. According to studies, by 2050 almost all cars and public transportation will be automated. Object detection is an essential and one of the most important tasks for self-driving cars. It allows the vehicle to sense and navigate their environment in a safe and efficient manner. This involves identifying and locating a variety of things in the car's field of vision including traffic lights, road signals, pedestrians and other cars. The goal of this research is to investigate and evaluate the issues that arise when autonomous automobiles use their visual subsystem to identify things. This paper proposes a unique custom Detection Transformer model for visual object detection in autonomous vehicles, specifically addressing the limitations of pre-trained models such as reduced accuracy for small objects and slower processing times. The study incorporates a self-attention mechanism that occurs after the DETR backbone has extracted features. Using an attention mechanism in the model will enhance the DETR's performance on the custom dataset. The proposed model achieves a 20% improvement in accuracy for detecting small objects compared to pre-trained models and can detect up to 100 objects per second with over 90% accuracy.

The mission will fly a single, wide field of view telescope mounted on top of a Ball Configurable Platform (BCP) bus to take near infrared images of hundreds of millions of galaxies and other astronomical phenomena over its two-year mission. SPHEREx is currently in phase C and recently completed its Systems Integration Review (SIR) in November of 2023 with hardware currently being built and tested for assembly, integration, and test (AI&T) in 2024. The mission is expected to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket out of Vandenberg, CA no earlier than February 2025.SPHEREx is a small, class C mission without the unique set of systems engineering personnel dedicated to verification and validation (V&V) tracking and execution that many larger, class A or B missions have. Maintaining accurate and insightful metrics despite unavoidable schedule changes requires time and resources the project lacks. These challenges motivated the Project Systems Engineering (PSE) team to investigate ways to streamline V&V tracking, leading to the development of a suite of automation tools that perform tasks and create visualizations and metrics that otherwise would have been done manually or not at all. This paper will discuss where and how the project has implemented automation as well as the impacts this has had on the ongoing Phase C work. The integration of these tools with commonly used software products (such as Microsoft Project and DOORS Next Generation) and how it allows the team to synchronize the project schedule with V&V activities and output useful information regarding current status and schedule dependencies will also be included.",IEEE Aerospace Conference,2024.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521298?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521298, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The students wanted more out of the class, and the lecture model was, frankly, boring for all of us. This began a four-year long project to convert the three major programming courses from standard lecture to a variation on project based learning. In each course, the project would be slowly introduced and appropriately scaffolded, with each new skill tied to the text and lectures. At the end of the term, students presented their work, as a written and oral report, to faculty and staff they did not know. While this project started out as a grand experiment, students were overwhelmingly positive about not only the project, but how much they learned that wasn/t in the text or lectures, and just as important, how much they learned about themselves. The growth in student confidence was clear. The poster will display information about two current projects, typical student artifacts, and an assortment of student comments from their final presentations. We will also discuss how the project idea was scaffolded to balance formal and informal student learning in the classroom.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2018.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3159450.3162245?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3159450.3162245, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It focuses on health-related risk behaviors, chronic conditions, and the use of preventive services. In study, we utilized a CSV dataset from Kaggle for the year 2015, containing 253,680 survey responses to the BRFSS2015. The dataset comprises 21 feature variables derived from questions posed to participants or calculated from their responses. The target variable, Diabetes binary, categorizes individuals as having either no diabetes (0) or prediabetes/diabetes (1). The dataset is imbalanced, reflecting real-world distributions of health conditions. We utilized a range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, gradient boosting machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, feed-forward neural networks, and Ada Boost, to predict diabetes status based on the provided features. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices were employed to assess model performance across different algorithms. Through this analysis, our goal is to offer insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques in predicting diabetes and highlight the significance of feature selection and model evaluation in healthcare applications.",2024 International Conference on Advances in Computing Research on Science Engineering and Technology (ACROSET),2024.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ACROSET62108.2024.10743921?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ACROSET62108.2024.10743921, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d905366406e61407bd8e900a18a9590f592f5ce0,Grit and first-year retention in engineering,"Recently “grit” has been defined by psychologists as a personal attribute that correlates with persistence through difficulties. We present our preliminary findings on grit and engineering students in this work-in-progress paper. We administered the Grit Scale in a first-year engineering design project course in a large public university in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 (n = 475). Using binary logistic regression, we showed that grit alone was not a significant predictor of retention in engineering. For future work, we will include two-year retention data and also consider moderating variables such as gender and ethnicity to determine whether their interaction with grit tells a different story. If the moderating variables reveal that grit is more important in retaining students with certain attributes, the Grit Scale may be useful in identifying at-risk students. If not, however, we will need to reconsider the Grit Scale when it is applied to engineering students.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2016.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757583?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757583, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5c63e14502f84a26999b7668c65224ec0e328f14,An Effective Framework for Enhancing Student Engagement and Performance in Final Year Projects,"Over the years, there have been many factors that have influenced the landscape of higher education within the UK. These factors include the rise in tuition fees, the introduction of the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) and the formation of Office for Students. Although student performance plays a vital part, another significantly influential key performance indicator that impacts these factors is student experience, which is influenced by positive or negative feedback and engagement. Despite student engagement forming a key part of the learning environment, it is still perceived as one of the weakest aspects when it comes to enhancing the student experience. In this paper, we present the implementation of an innovative, holistic teaching & learning framework for the final year project module trialed within the Department of Engineering and Computing at the University of East London. This project module had been running in different forms since the inception of the undergraduate programmes within the department, however it generally yielded poor and inconsistent evaluation, student experience and engagement. The framework was introduced during the academic year 2015/16, where its evaluation has shown a positive impact on student engagement, performance and experience, compared to the previous year.",IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference,2019.0,3,1,"{'url': 'https://repository.uel.ac.uk/download/e3c40197ea7e1fde765407cdf59ea0bd74883d83e1585775d1a9d3a9fa07ebed/1004976/An%20Effective%20Framework%20for%20Enhancing%20Student-%20Final.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725253?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725253, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4ebe6eedaf94767eb6c3c59c903cb6fee56c1a33,Drive Dash: Vehicle Crash Insights Reporting System,"The United States grapples with significant road safety challenges due to high traffic volumes and frequent accidents. In 2020, Forbes reported that there were 35,766 fatal car accidents in the U.S. Also, 1,593,390 crashes caused injuries, and 3,621,681 led to property damage. In total, there were 5,250,837 collisions that year, showing a significant problem with vehicle accidents in America. Drive Dash is an advanced system designed to learn from past crash data in Baltimore. It analyzes hotspots for crashes involving both trucks and regular vehicles. This system has an easy-to-use interface made with React for users, and it runs on Python with a containerized MongoDB backend. For hotspot analysis, the system looked at 170,000 records from 2015 to 2021, using methods like density estimation and clustering. The results showed that Gaithersburg had the highest number of crashes at 14.2%, totaling 22,685. In Derwood, medium truck crashes accounted for 13.7% (238), while heavy truck crashes in Silver Spring reached 17.2% (236). Drive Dash combines MongoDB with ReactJS for quick data access. It identifies areas with frequent vehicle and truck crashes, aiding city planners in improving infrastructure and helping travelers steer clear of these hazardous spots. This study serves as a vital tool for civic planners to pinpoint trouble areas for better road safety measures, ultimately making traveling safer for everyone.",2024 International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Advanced Applications (ICISAA),2024.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICISAA62385.2024.10828724?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISAA62385.2024.10828724, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Data collected over a five-year period (2015–2023) from an educational institution was employed to analyze and predict student performance using three key techniques: ID3, C4.5, and Random Forest. The results indicated that C4.5 achieved higher accuracy compared to the other techniques. The decision tree constructed by C4.5 was efficiently pruned, making it more effective. Furthermore, the performance of the J48 model, which is an implementation of C4.5 in Weka, outperformed both ID3 and Random Forest. The study reveals that employing the C4.5 algorithm for data mining consistently yields superior results in predicting and improving undergraduate student performance compared to alternative methods. It underscores the efficacy of utilizing data mining techniques to enhance educational outcomes in higher education. It highlights how C4.5 algorithm can achieve faster and more accurate results, emphasizing the potential for enhancing educational outcomes.","2024 International Mobile, Intelligent, and Ubiquitous Computing Conference (MIUCC)",2024.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/MIUCC62295.2024.10783600?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/MIUCC62295.2024.10783600, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f9e7c0daf9b5005e3de05559dee7af556406a71c,Short-Term Load Forecasting Employing Recurrent Neural Networks,"This research paper explores the domain of Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) through the application of Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models. Focused on the west region of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the study employs a dataset spanning 2012–2015, enriched with new features such as day of the month, month of the year, and a detailed holiday classification. The dataset also incorporates hourly temperature, humidity, time of the day, day of the week, and hourly load values, offering a comprehensive perspective for load forecasting. Through meticulous hyperparameter tuning, LSTM and GRU models are optimized to find their best architecture. Four evaluation metrics have been employed to assess the performance of our models, namely, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination or R Squared (R2). With the identified optimal hyperparameters and look-back window, the obtained values for MAE, RMSE, MAPE and R2 for the LSTM model are 8.94, 12.24, 0.80 and 0.9973, respectively. The GRU model also achieves good performance with MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2 of 10.72, 14.48, 0.96, and 0.9962, respectively. Our research shows that the accuracy of STLF on the dataset has been improved by adding new features and fine-tuning the LSTM and GRU models, with the LSTM model achieving the best performance.",International Conference on Smart Communications and Networking,2024.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/SmartNets61466.2024.10577742?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartNets61466.2024.10577742, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a1a031c7652139564ffc7a650c9293fa349afd1d,"Machine learning Model, predicting South Korea precipitation","The risks arising from precipitation are immediate and broad. The Korea Meteorological Administration also carries out predictions and observations on precipitation in Korea. Still, the results are inaccurate due to cases where precipitation in the north is not well matched or incorrect observations are made due to difficulties in identifying the surface. We intend to construct accurate precipitation data by analyzing a machine-learning model. If highly influential precipitation data are properly secured, it is expected that it will benefit greatly from more accurate analysis of health effects.After collecting and refining data from 2015 to 2023 for about 50 detailed variables related to temperature, river, and snow using Google Earth Engine data, which is the input of the model, ASOS (Automated Synchronous Observing System) data from the Korea Meteorological Administration are collected in the same manner as in the relevant year and combined based on GeoID. Among many ASOS data parameters, precipitation data were used and provided as ground truth for the model. Random Forest, XGB (Extreme Gradient Boosting), which is known to be effective with those data, is used and the best performance model is chosen as the final model.The R2 of the model using XGB was about 0.8.When the additional hyperparameter was not used, the R2 of the model using XGB was the best at 0.8 which is a high value compared to the others",IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine,2024.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822089?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822089, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Depicting the Yearly Hot Topics, using Language Processing","The Sustainable Development Goals have become indispensable for the international agenda since their official launch in 2015. Corroborated, the publication of the yearly SDG reports represents a candid focal point for the gained progress, as long as a clear depiction of the global challenges, resources, and knowledge. Thus, in the 2016-2023 period, eight annual reports have been published, containing more than 500 content pages. Starting from those, we aim to design an explorative analysis framework, through the computation of several language processing techniques from the family of text mining, and sentiment analysis. Our objective will be to identify the top-level hot topics of every year, while also pinpointing certain temporal dynamics in terms of new or recurrent subjects, international threats, or social-economic discourse elements. Deep-diving into the methodological instruments, the analysis will be based on a mix of techniques, starting from the illustration of the most common terms and collocations. Afterward, we will apply the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency algorithm to highlight the importance of several words relative to the entire collection of documents, with a focus on the evolutive dimension. Going forward, we will evaluate the sentiment scores for each report, to assess whether in certain moments the general tone of the conversation has switched to a more negative or positive valence. Throughout the applicative section, we will present the results through several graphical visualisations meant to better profile the connections between concepts. Finally, we consider the current approach to be valuable for understanding the general evolutions in terms of sustainable development, creating a summative and computational-based exploration of the progress generated worldwide in the last decade.",Proceedings of the International Conference on Economics and Social Sciences,2024.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.24818/icess/2024/049?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.24818/icess/2024/049, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5697991bad61027b117618654068f11558da4c83,Education in IT as means of implementing strategy for development of Russian IT industry up to 2025,"This paper has been created with the purpose to analyze the challenges that the Russian IT sector faces with an emphasis on the role to be played by the educational system to help bridge the technological gap. At present, Russia has a well-developed economy of the twentieth century. It largely consists in the extraction and export of mineral resources. The twenty first century calls for an innovation economy. It is intellect-intensive with a high added value. Information technologies are at the heart of such an economy. The Russian government has adopted a Strategy for the development of the IT sector, but there are challenges to deal with. The biggest challenge, however, is a shortage of highly qualified IT professionals. The authors have put the shortage at 130 000 - to 280 000 IT people within a five-year timeframe, which is in line with most of the other assessments. It's worth noting that IT people will be hard to import, even though Russia is in second place world-wide in attracting labor migrants. Europe has a sharper shortage and enjoys a higher standard of living, so Russia will find it hard to compete. In other words, Russia can bridge the shortage only by graduating more IT professionals. The first steps in this direction have been taken, i.e. Innopolis University, Technopark Mail.ru, but it's not enough. The good work must continue, otherwise modernization will dry up.",International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning,2014.0,1,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/icl.2014.7017787?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/icl.2014.7017787, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a887c8680330239fa8d28f5b40712c2fba513435,Analysis of Factors Influencing The Use of QRIS Through Mobile Banking in Jakarta and Tangerang,"The growth of Indonesia’s payment via mobile phones has increased lately. In 2019, QRIS was launched by Bank Indonesia and it has been used to make payments using every application that utilizes the QRIS system. By the year of 2025, Bank Indonesia expects to focus on digital finance, including banking digitalization. However, the number of QRIS transactions are still less than other payment methods. Therefore, in order to better understand users’ acceptance of QRIS as a payment method through mobile banking applications, this research is conducted. This study uses the TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) with other independent variables using a quantitative method by distributing questionnaires to people that uses QRIS on mobile banking applications in Jakarta and Tangerang with 355 respondents. The data was examined using the Partial Least Square (PLS) approach of the Structural Equation Model (SEM) using the analytical tool SMART PLS. The findings in this study show that perceived compatibility affects both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Effort expectancy affects perceived ease of use, all three factors of perceived security, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use affects attitude toward using, and attitude toward using affects behavioral intention to use. However, social influence does not affect both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. The result of this study may give the QRIS payment system room for improvements to be more impactful in their users’ daily lives therefore they are able to influence other people to use QRIS as a payment system.",2023 6th International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Networks (ISCON),2023.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ISCON57294.2023.10111978?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCON57294.2023.10111978, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The three-year (2015-2017) time series data for both ambient air pollutant concentrations and COPD hospitalizations in Chengdu are approved for the study. The big data statistic analysis shows that Air Quality Index (AQI) exceeded the lighted air polluted level in Chengdu region are mainly attributed to particulate matters (i.e., PM2.5 and PM10). The time series study for consecutive ambient air pollutant concentrations reveal that AQI, PM2.5, and PM10 are significantly positive correlated, especially when the number of consecutive polluted days is greater than nine days. The daily COPD hospitalizations for every 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10 indicate that consecutive ambient air pollution can lead to an appearance of an elevation of COPD admissions, and also present that dynamic responses before and after the peak admission are different. Support Vector Regression (SVR) is then used to describe the dynamics of COPD hospitalizations to consecutive ambient air pollution.

8e51b4d27b0afdaaf4b3cf5f5574db92179e09be,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) implementation in the Design of Single Pilot
 Operations Commercial Airplanes","This research aims to present, identify, and propose the implementation
 of AI technology in aviation decision-making, as well as examine how AI can
 affect the transition from multi-crew to eMCO and SiPO, based on the
 rationale that the single-pilot human operator having accessible data in a
 timely and naturally interactive fashion could enhance natural decision
 making (NDM) (Klein, 2008; Orasanu & Fischer, 1997).According to the
 industrial roadmaps, the first certification of assistance for pilots is
 anticipated to occur in the year 2025, and this will be followed by a
 gradual transition to full autonomy sometime around the year 2035. The
 progression of events in the field of commercial air transport can be broken
 down into three distinct stages:•First step: crew assistance/ augmentation
 (2022-2025)•Second step: human/ machine collaboration (2025-2030)•Third
 step: autonomous commercial air transport (2035+)There have been identified
 two different operational concepts:Extended Minimum-Crew Operations (eMCOs),
 formerly known as ""Reduced Crew Operations,"" in which single-pilot
 operations are permitted during the cruise phase of the flight with a level
 of safety similar to that of today's two-pilot operations (to be implemented
 beginning in the year 2025).Single-Pilot Operations (SiPOs), in which, at a
 later stage, end-to-end single-pilot operations might be allowed, also based
 on a level of safety equivalent to today's two-pilot operations, to be
 implemented as of the year 2030. Single-Pilot Operations (SiPOs), in which,
 at a later stage, end-to-end single-pilot operations might be allowed.The
 proposed artificial intelligence aviation decision-making research in
 cockpit design and users' experience was constructed by first surveying the
 current literature about Artificial Intelligence (AI). The findings point to
 the difficulties artificial intelligence poses, including its limitations
 and users' resistance, in shifting from multi-crew operations to e-MCO and
 SiPO. This resistance to change should be considered when designing any
 potential upgrades to the AI cockpit design or user interactions. However,
 the existing commercially available  AI technology may be ready to serve
 some low-impact or non-time-critical applications (for example, weather in
 destination and alternate airports update during the cruise phase) in this
 transitional period to eMCOs and SiPOs, which would postpone the necessity
 for a complete flight deck redesign at this time (Stanton & Harris,
 2015). The utilization of AI for the administration of systems and the
 retrieval of information has the potential to improve both the perception
 (Level 1 SA) and comprehension (Level 2 SA) of pilots (Endsley, 1995).
 Therefore, the single-pilot human operator in the NDM cockpit environment
 who has data accessible promptly and in a naturally engaging fashion would
 be able to make judgments that are more fulfilling and closer to optimums in
 the NDM environment (Klein, 2008; Orasanu & Fischer, 1997).",International Conference on Intelligent Human Systems Integration,2023.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.54941/ahfe1002910?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.54941/ahfe1002910, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Rubin Observatory is preparing to execute the most ambitious astronomical survey ever attempted, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Currently the final phase of construction is under way in the Chilean Andes, with the Observatory’s ten-year science mission scheduled to begin in 2025. Rubin’s 8.4-meter telescope will nightly scan the southern hemisphere collecting imagery in the wavelength range 320–1050 nm covering the entire observable sky every 4 nights using a 3.2 gigapixel camera, the largest imaging device ever built for astronomy. Automated detection and classification of celestial objects will be performed by sophisticated algorithms on high-resolution images to progressively produce an astronomical catalog eventually composed of 20 billion galaxies and 17 billion stars and their associated physical properties.In this article we present an overview of the system currently being constructed to perform data distribution as well as the annual campaigns which reprocess the entire image dataset collected since the beginning of the survey. These processing campaigns will utilize computing and storage resources provided by three Rubin data facilities (one in the US and two in Europe). Each year a Data Release will be produced and disseminated to science collaborations for use in studies comprising four main science pillars: probing dark matter and dark energy, taking inventory of solar system objects, exploring the transient optical sky and mapping the Milky Way.Also presented is the method by which we leverage some of the common tools and best practices used for management of large-scale distributed data processing projects in the high energy physics and astronomy communities.

The deep neural network has been widely acknowledged as being in a golden age and advancing with the advent of new technologies. It is slowly becoming the leader of the technological world in artificial intelligence. The models which are built by machine learning algorithms with great accuracy help in every sector of human evolution. Image and audio processing is done through many algorithms to intensify its behavioral pattern. The development of modern art is largely dependent on the painters who are developing the style. The Deep Dream algorithm can also do the artistic creation of the image and audio. The deep dream algorithm which googles engineer Alexander Mordvintsevin built in the year 2015. It enhances the patterns in the multimedia through algorithmic pareidolia. It creates a dream-like effect. It gives a new vision of hallucinations to images. This could be used in the health sector for the purpose of detecting diseases and defects through scans of the patients. It is redefining lower-definition multimedia to higher-definition multimedia. Previous model were able to only generate one of the multimedia format. Proposed system will be able to create multimedia based on DeepDream and link different formats together so that they appear to be generated together.,"2023 International Conference on Advances in Electronics, Communication, Computing and Intelligent Information Systems (ICAECIS)",2023.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICAECIS58353.2023.10170138?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAECIS58353.2023.10170138, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The rapid urbanization of Bangalore poses significant challenges for urban planning and development. In this research paper, we explore the use of geo-spatial analysis to monitor and predict urban growth over time. We use historical data to train a cellular automata model, and the model’s parameters are obtained via the use of a genetic algorithm. We then simulate and predict future growth patterns for the city, up to 2025, taking 2017 as the base year. By adjusting the parameters of the model, we explore different growth scenarios and their potential impacts on the city. The paper emphasizes the importance of sustainable urban development, including good public infrastructure and considerations such as flood risk and proximity to public transportation.

In this paper, we firstly investigated and analyzed, we chose the number of the elderly population, the ""elderly model 9037"", the constant level of Chinese household consumption and the degree of self-reliance of the elderly as the variables of the model of the demand for elderly service beds. By reviewing the number of elderly population and the number of labor employment in China from 2009-2018 using polynomial fitting to reasonably predict the values of the two variables for each year from 2019-2025, substituting them into the model of demand for senior care service beds to derive the values of the demand for senior care service beds. Secondly, the model of balance of payments and revenues is established to consider the costs and revenues, and the amount of revenues and expenditures is calculated according to the different types of elderly people. The potential revenue in different years is calculated to quantify the size of the market opportunity.

5ecc3e4e11fe7849c6997548827df7047c01e51e,Reflective Structuration of Knowledge Building Practices in Grade 5 Science: A Two-Year Design-Based Research,"This study was conducted in two Grade 5 classes (A and B) taught by the same teacher in two successive school years. Each year students studied human body systems over a whole school year using Knowledge Forum (KF). Both classes worked with an idea-centered, principle-based framework of knowledge building; students in class B (year 2) particularly engaged in reflective structuration to co-construct structures of inquiry as their work unfolded. Qualitative analyses of rich classroom data elaborated the reflective structuration process in class B. The analyses of student online discourse showed that compared to class A in year 1, class B made more purposeful and sustained contributions to understanding various human body systems and developed more sophisticated explanations. Introduction Despite the advances made in understanding the social and cognitive interactions in collaborative inquiry and knowledge building, the field of computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) still faces the challenge of how to bring sustained inquiry and collaborative knowledge building to classrooms so as to transform educational practices (Stahl & Hesse, 2009; cf. NRC, 2012). Beyond understanding the specific social and cognitive processes of idea development, research on knowledge building and collaborative learning needs a social practices perspective, to incorporate a larger focus on the social practices enacted by students and their teacher to sustain and channel their cognitive and social moves for long-term productivity (Hakkarainen, 2009; Stahl & Hesse, 2009). In real-world knowledge building practices, participants continually build on and advance the knowledge assets of their community by generating and identifying promising ideas and improving the ideas through sustained inquiry and discourse; by formulating deeper problems as solutions are developed; and by assuming leadership and responsibility at the highest levels instead of relying on the leader to tell them what to do (Amar, 2002; Dunbar, 1997; Sawyer, 2007). They do not simply enact repeated procedures but continually create and adapt their social practices as their knowledge is advanced (Knorr Cetina, 2001, Zhang et al., 2009). To address the dynamic nature of social practices for knowledge building in classrooms, a principle-based, as opposed to procedure-based approach to inquiry is needed (Scardamalia, 2002). Drawing upon the Knowledge Building pedagogy (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006), a renowned inquiry-based program to cultivate authentic knowledge-creating practices, we explored how students and teachers worked with a set of principles to co-design their classroom practices and chart the unfolding course of inquiry (Zhang et al., 2011). This line of research has led to the discovery of an important socio-epistemic mechanism enabling sustained practices of knowledge building: reflective structuration by which knowledge building communities co-construct, adapt, and use collective structures to guide their collaborative deepening work on ideas (Zhang, 2012). Different from many other inquiry-based learning programs (e.g. project-based learning) in which students are required to work on predefined tasks/problems using step-by-step procedures and scripts, Knowledge Building adopts an idea-centered and principle-based approach to classroom design. Guided by a set of knowledge building principles (e.g. epistemic agency, authentic problems and real ideas, improvable ideas, collective cognitive responsibility) (Scardamalia, 2002; Zhang et al., 2011), students and their teachers co-construct and reconstruct the flow of inquiry as their work proceeds. A conceptual as well as practical challenge arises pertaining to how the idea-centered, open-ended actions/interactions are translated into coherent, supportive, long-term classroom practices without extensive teacher pre-scripting. We identify reflective structuration as a potential solution to this challenge, and elaborate this concept based on social practice theories (Giddens, 1984; Sewell, 1992). The key to understanding how knowledge building as a social practice can be possibly sustained lies in the dynamic relationship between human agency and social structures that presuppose each other. Social practices become organized and sustained over time because of their relatively stable structures. Such structures both constrain and enable human agency. Actors appropriate existing structures which are historically formed in their institutional contexts, use the structures to plan and guide their ongoing actions, and reflexively monitor what is going on. The actors’ agency is reflected in their capability to reinterpret, modify, reorganize, and recreate the structures, influencing future practices by themselves and by other members (Sewell, 1992). In line with the social practice theories, our empirical analysis of productive CSCL 2017 Proceedings 644 © ISLS knowledge building communities revealed that members engage in dual-level construction driven by their agency: as members contribute content-specific questions and ideas to build knowledge, they co-construct collective structures of knowledge practices to guide and support their collaboration and contribution (Tao et al., 2015, 2016). The collective structures serve as shared frames of knowledge building activities signifying structural properties of inquiry, including the epistemic objects/issues to be investigated as the focus of unfolding strands of practices (epistemic structure) (Knorr Cetina, 2001), productive ways to conduct research and discourse (pragmatic structure), and who should work with whom in what roles (participatory structure) (Zhang, 2012). Students use such co-constructed structures to monitor and regulate their joint inquiry and position their roles and contributions. Our prior exploratory studies have analyzed how students generated and adapted epistemic and pragmatic structures to guide their knowledge building (Tao et al., 2015, 2016; Zhang et al., 2015). The current study further examines the processes and impacts of reflective structuration more systematically through a two-year designbased study, with students in year 2 engaging in reflective structuration more intentionally to frame/reframe shared areas/objects of inquiry for unfolding inquiry practices. Our research questions ask: How did the teacher and her students implement reflective structuration? Did the reflective structuration design in year 2 leverage sustained knowledge building practices among students?

43711d5a1f4982a69d6f4691158d1738ceaa4fc4,First-Year Program Enhancements at Liberty University,"Liberty University’s School of Engineering and Computational Sciences was established in 2007 and currently offers undergraduate programs in Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Science (with four cognates), as well as a graduate program in Cyber Security. The First Year Engineering program has recently completed the third year of an ongoing initiative to transform it from a ‘make or break’ mindset to one more focused on preparing the incoming students for success in their engineering programs, which is the focus of this ‘work-in-progress’ report. A number of new active learning pedagogies have been implemented in the Introduction to Engineering course to provide a greater focus on critical thinking, metacognition, and acquisition of effective student learning skills. Additionally, a number of student success initiatives have been instituted and additional initiatives are planned for the future. The results, while not yet up to the levels typically cited at the First Year Engineering Experience annual conference, have nonetheless been encouraging and are discussed in this report. Index Terms – First-year engineering, Design Your Own Plan, Master student, Cooperative learning HISTORY OF ENGINEERING PROGRAMS AT LIBERTY The School of Engineering and Computational Sciences (SoECS) at Liberty University was established in 2007, initially offering four engineering programs serving an incoming freshman class of 44 students. The first Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering, and Industrial & Systems Engineering graduates received their degrees in 2011, with the first Computer Engineering graduates following in 2012. Although the Software Engineering program was subsequently dropped, the Electrical and Industrial & Systems Engineering programs received ABET accreditation in 2012, followed by Computer Engineering in 2013. The Mechanical Engineering program was started in 2014 and is on track to have its first graduates in 2018, with ABET accreditation to follow. Civil Engineering is tentatively planned for startup in the 2018-19 school year. Incoming freshman class size has grown steadily, reaching a peak enrollment of 249 declared engineering majors in the 2015-2016 school year. From its inception, the entry point for the engineering programs at the SoECS has been ENGR 110, Introduction to Engineering and Problem Solving. This course introduces engineering neophytes to the principles of problem solving, critical thinking, programming concepts, engineering ethics, and the engineering design process. Students enrolled in the course must function at a precalculus or higher level of mathematics, which may be satisfied by concurrent enrollment. There are currently no restrictions to students declaring engineering as their major. This initial program setup assumed that students entering their freshman year of college were adequately prepared for the rigors of the engineering programs. However, over the ensuing years, it became obvious that this was not the case, as evidenced by high freshman to sophomore attrition rates and low graduation rates. This lead to a decision by the Dean of the SoECS to appoint a first-year programs coordinator (JLL) and challenged him with improving freshman to sophomore persistence rates. The first order of business was to get ‘plugged in’ to the First Year Engineering Experience (FYEE) movement, starting with attendance at the 6 Annual FYEE Conference hosted by Texas A&M University. It was at this conference that the coordinator first met Ray Landis and became aware of the importance of preparing students for success in their engineering education. Exposure to the variety of pedagogies and program initiatives being employed across a broad spectrum of engineering schools led to a number of changes being implemented to the Introduction to Engineering course in the Fall 2014 term, with additional changes to program infrastructure, teaching pedagogies, and student success initiatives in the subsequent terms. TEACHING PEDAGOGIES IMPLEMENTED Significant changes to teaching resources and pedagogies implemented in the first-year engineering programs over the past three years include: • Adoption of Studying Engineering: A Road Map to a Rewarding Career. Ray Landis’ seminal work [1] was established as a foundational text in the Introduction to Engineering course. In-class discussions and out-ofclass reflective writings serve to instill and reinforce the attributes of a master learner into the engineering students. • Addition of the ‘Design Your Own Plan’ project: Development of an individual success plan serves as the culminating student development activity in Introduction to Engineering course. This project focuses on the student’s educational and professional goals and the",2017 FYEE Conference Proceedings,2017.0,1,0,"{'url': 'https://peer.asee.org/29411.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18260/1-2--29411?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--29411, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Educational data mining aims to discover hidden knowledge and patterns about student performance. This paper proposes a student performance prediction model by applying two classification algorithms: KNN and Naïve Bayes on educational data set of secondary schools, collected from the ministry of education in Gaza Strip for 2015 year. The main objective of such classification may help the ministry of education to improve the performance due to early prediction of student performance. Teachers also can take the proper evaluation to improve student learning. The experimental results show that Naïve Bayes is better than KNN by receiving the highest accuracy value of 93.6%.",2017 8th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT),2017.0,125,11,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICITECH.2017.8079967?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITECH.2017.8079967, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

dbd847569fe22efa2c5e79a77fc369f913127fb9,Computing Challenges for the Einstein Telescope project,"The discovery of gravitational waves, first observed in September 2015 following the merger of a binary black hole system, has already revolutionised our understanding of the Universe. This was further enhanced in August 2017, when the coalescence of a binary neutron star system was observed both with gravitational waves and a variety of electromagnetic counterparts; this joint observation marked the beginning of gravitational multimessenger astronomy. The Einstein Telescope, a proposed next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave observatory, will dramatically increase the sensitivity to sources: the number of observations of gravitational waves is expected to increase from roughly 100 per year to roughly 100’000 per year, and signals may be visible for hours at a time, given the low frequency cutoff of the planned instrument. This increase in the number of observed events, and the duration with which they are observed, is hugely beneficial to the scientific goals of the community but poses a number of significant computing challenges. Moreover, the currently used computing algorithms do not scale to this new environment, both in terms of the amount of resources required and the speed with which each signal must be characterised. This contribution will discuss the Einstein Telescope's computing challenges, and the activities that are underway to prepare for them. Available computing resources and technologies will greatly evolve in the years ahead, and those working to develop the Einstein Telescope data analysis algorithms will need to take this into account. It will also be important to factor into the initial development of the experiment's computing model the availability of huge parallel HPC systems and ubiquitous Cloud computing; the design of the model will also, for the first time, include the environmental impact as one of the optimisation metrics.",EPJ Web of Conferences,2023.0,3,0,"{'url': 'https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2024/05/epjconf_chep2024_04015.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11103, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c9c203896657e297c1efb9279ac88cb0c106094a,Exploration of Various Machine Learning Techniques for Identifying and Mitigating DDoS Attacks,"This study is conducted as a result of some of the key observations documented in a recent study published by IEEE, titled ""Threat Actors’ Tenacity to Disrupt: Examination of Major Cybersecurity incidents"" where some of the key findings therein that study describes how DDoS attack together with other attack techniques were used by threat actors to disrupt public and private enterprises on multiple occasions. In this study, there is a focus on DDoS attacks and exploration of how various machine learning techniques may be leveraged to identify and mitigate them. Real world examples of major DDoS attacks that happened and reported or announced to the public were examined and it was found that in the last seven years, there has been an increase in the use of DDoS attacks to cause major disruptions to organizations. In a total of over 700 major cybersecurity incidents that we analyzed from 2015 to 2022, evidence of DDoS attacks were found every year. Hence, in that subset of dataset we examined, there was an increase from 8 to 31 major DDoS attacks from 2021 to 2022 which is an estimate of 288 percent increase. Due to the volume of network traffic analysis involved in the detection of DDoS events which more often may be very difficult for humans to manually or efficiently analyze, the validation of the importance of utilizing AI technologies such machine learning algorithms as effective capabilities for the detection of DDoS attacks and DDoS mitigation are assessed in this study. Identification of specific machine learning algorithms that may be used for the detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks were looked into. Given that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the mitigation of DDoS attacks, this study echoes the leveraging of the CIS Benchmarks and also encourages organizations to adopt referencing one of the NIST frameworks that was released to the public on January 26, 2023 titled ""AI Risk Management Framework"" as guidelines in ensuring multiple layers of controls in handling DDoS attacks.","Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust",2023.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/PST58708.2023.10320151?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/PST58708.2023.10320151, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b966bf7fb7b93dc4698d8658d9bcba5bcd96bb4d,An Effective Machine Learning based Heart Disease Diagnosis Analysis,"Heart disease has been the prime cause of death for many decades. In 2015, research was conducted to go through studies conducted in high-income areas. The studies were limited to those performed till May of that year. They were reviewed for data pulling. A strong correlation between social reclusion/ detachment and cardiac condition was found. Possible solutions were found to be educational campaigns & other communicative exercises. Further, it was understood via a separate study that faster diagnosis can help in starting the rehabilitation process much more efficiently with more chances of recovery. MLP or Multilayer Perceptrons were one of the ways to conduct such tests for early diagnosis/detection. In 2016, the correlation between sugar industries and coronary heart disease was studied in detail. Further such studies figured out the association of cause. In this paper, we are associating and basing our predictions on symptoms. In the same year (2016), a data prediction system based on data mining was sourced. With vast data present, applying ML to predict cardiac conditions became more manageable. Even in 2017, heart disease was the leading cause of death which took more than 1500000 lives. Recently, researchers have been looking into stress echocardiography & cell therapy both focusing on prediction & recovery respectively. Here in this paper, we are using some traditional ML techniques and applying hybridization to add to the process of fast prediction.","2023 International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Technology and Networking (CICTN)",2023.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/cictn57981.2023.10141082?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/cictn57981.2023.10141082, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c0c177bb82ff1e58ce0b1f6bdbaf9b678c0963c9,Digital Transformation of Tax and Accounting Processes,"The world today is changing rapidly in many ways. Fundamental changes that differ country by country are visible also in the area of taxes and accounting. New activities whose adoption is enabled due to the great development of technologies in fact exert pressure on individual economic subjects′ actions in many areas. This is visible also in supporting activities like tax and accounting processing. Setting of business processes has to be therefore changed quite often as a reaction to the frequent changes in legislation regulating these areas. Legislation in these two areas, taken from the Czech accounting units′ point of view, changes so often. Even if these changes of the legislative framework can be described as more frequent in the area of taxation (great change at least twice a year, often in the area of income taxes), this year the great change happened also in the area of accounting. In association with the adoption of the New accounting act started to be influenced set accounting processes of accounting units concerned. New accounting act should come into force since January 1, 2025. The aim of this contribution is to identify and, through the analysis of the development of digitalization tools, assess the possibilities of selected accounting units in the area of digital transformation of tax and accounting processes.

However, e-commerce can shift the demand for labor through the reduction of conventional or retail employment and increase the demand for labor in the fields of Information, Communication, Technology, and knowledge (ICTD) which has the potential to increase unemployment. However, there has been no empirical research that discussed the impact of e-commerce on the shifting demand for labor in Indonesia. The purpose of this research is to find out the description and the factors that influence the demand for ICTD and conventional labor in Indonesia year 2015 - 2017. The statistical method used is panel data regression. This study proves that shifts in labor demand have occurred in Indonesia. E-commerce has a positive and significant effect on the demand for ICTD labor and negative and significant effect on the demand for conventional labor. Based on this research, the government needs to prepare public access facilities to be able to take advantage of e-commerce.",International Conference on Orange Technologies,2019.0,1,0,"{'url': 'https://download.atlantis-press.com/article/125918464.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2991/icot-19.2019.41?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2991/icot-19.2019.41, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

67bc2766c80364878d0cd83f81d83ef996cfb706,Leadership and cooperation in Google Docs based group work,"This paper examines how Google Docs is used and affects group work in the classroom. Methodologically, the study applies video ethnography and focus group interviews with pupils in two first year classes at a Danish upper secondary school. Google Docs is a widely used digital tool at Danish upper secondary schools and has been associated with “considerable potential […] to serve as a platform for collaborative work” (Chu & Kennedy, 2011). However, contrary to these assumptions this case revealed that actual written collaboration on Google Docs was minimal. Instead, in all the examined groups, a leader was identified that dominated the groups' work and writing. Theoretically, the paper take inspiration from Networked Learning and its critical approach towards usage of digital technologies in education. This includes acknowledging that, increasingly, learning combines digital and non-digital forms, and that, generally, technology play an active role in learning (Hodgson & McConnell, 2019; Fawns, 2018). Also, perspectives on affordances (Gibson, 1979; boyd, 2014), socio-material interactions (Sørensen, 2009), and leadership (Goffman, 1981) provide insights into the group work analysis. Video ethnographic method enables a detailed analysis of the group members’ oral as well as written interactions in Google Docs, thus paying “attention to the whole ecology“ of the group work settings (Bhatt, de Roock & Adams, 2015). The aim is to analyse the socio-material interactions in the groups, specifically the interactions between the pupils and Google Docs. This includes 1) how the pupils use Google Docs in relation to their group work, including how they combine oral and written communication, 2) how different leadership roles emerge, and 3) how the hybrid learning spaces (Ellis & Goodyear, 2016) afforded by the material surroundings in the group work settings seem to promote or inhibit collaboration within the groups. In specific, the case discusses how Google Docs configures space in a way that seems to afford cooperation (i.e. divided work among the group members with each person responsible for solving a different portion of the problem) rather than collaboration (i.e. coordinated, synchronous work activity on a shared problem). The final part of the paper will touch upon some didactical implications of the findings in the study.",Networked Learning Conference,2024.0,0,0,"{'url': 'https://journals.aau.dk/index.php/nlc/article/download/8641/6921', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.54337/nlc.v12.8641?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.54337/nlc.v12.8641, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

95ca4a35ae074a86fd42f2f62bc8badefc0afef1,Towards Sustainable Deep Learning for Wireless Fingerprinting Localization,"Location based services, already popular with end users, are now inevitably becoming part of new wireless infrastructures and emerging business processes. The increasingly popular Deep Learning (DL) artificial intelligence methods perform very well in wireless fingerprinting localization based on extensive indoor radio measurement data. However, with the increasing complexity these methods become computationally very intensive and energy hungry, both for their training and subsequent operation. Considering only mobile users, estimated to exceed 7.4 billion by the end of 2025, and assuming that the networks serving these users will need to perform only one localization per user per hour on average, the machine learning models used for the calculation would need to perform 65×1012 predictions per year. Add to this equation tens of billions of other connected devices and applications that rely heavily on more frequent location updates, and it becomes apparent that localization will contribute significantly to carbon emissions unless more energy-efficient models are developed and used. This motivated our work on a new DL-based architecture for indoor localization that is more energy efficient compared to related state-of-the-art approaches while showing only marginal performance degradation. A detailed performance evaluation shows that the proposed model produces only 58% of the carbon footprint while maintaining 98.7% of the overall performance compared to state of the art model external to our group. Additionally, we elaborate on a methodology to calculate the complexity of the DL model and thus the CO2 footprint during its training and operation.",ICC 2022 - IEEE International Conference on Communications,2022.0,6,1,"{'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09071', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09071, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d577251c4baec04e813593ff832378868d470de3,"Analyzing Bitcoin Blockchain Data: Insights, Coefficients and Model Adequacy","The investigation examines the analysis of data derived from the Bitcoin blockchain with the aim of uncovering noteworthy facts pertaining to its behavior. The present research used regression analysis as a methodological framework to investigate the relationship that exists between the median confirmation time, the logarithm of the number of transactions that occur in a block, and the average transaction cost. This was done in order to determine whether or not there is a correlation between these three variables. The model's coefficients 0, 1, and 2 provide insightful information regarding the influence that these factors have on the confirmation times experienced by users of the Bitcoin network. Nevertheless, the study demonstrates that the chosen indicators, when examined in isolation, do not provide a comprehensive rationale for the observed variations in confirmation durations during the entire year of 2015. This observation implies the existence of uncontrolled variables that have not been taken into consideration. Further investigation is required to determine these variables and enhance the model's explanatory power.

522106b4765c34c6f663403a5fea68e0801fb852,A real-time autonomous highway accident detection model based on big data processing and computational intelligence,"Due to increasing urban population and growing number of motor vehicles, traffic congestion is becoming a major problem of the 21st century. One of the main reasons behind traffic congestion is accidents which can not only result in casualties and losses for the participants, but also in wasted and lost time for the others that are stuck behind the wheels. Early detection of an accident can save lives, provides quicker road openings, hence decreases wasted time and resources, and increases efficiency. In this study, we propose a preliminary real-time autonomous accident-detection system based on computational intelligence techniques. Istanbul City traffic-flow data for the year 2015 from various sensor locations are populated using big data processing methodologies. The extracted features are then fed into a nearest neighbor model, a regression tree, and a feed-forward neural network model. For the output, the possibility of an occurrence of an accident is predicted. The results indicate that even though the number of false alarms dominates the real accident cases, the system can still provide useful information that can be used for status verification and early reaction to possible accidents.",2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2016.0,69,4,"{'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09227', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09227, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Solid waste management is a grave concern for Bangladesh. By 2025 waste generation per capita will be 0.75 kg/capita/day, and the total amount of waste will reach 21.07 million tons per year. Our proposed deep learning-based waste detection approach is to detect and locate solid waste in real-time images in the context of Bangladesh. One of the main concerns was to train our model with a proper dataset that could detect many items accurately. So we collected our dataset from several open sources, and one-third of the images used in this research are our own collected images, and we fully annotated these data. Our system can detect 12 types of waste like paper, plastic, polythene, glass, metal, bio, e-waste, etc. Our best classification accuracy rate is 73%, and the F1 score is 0.729.","Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference",2022.0,5,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/UEMCON54665.2022.9965643?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/UEMCON54665.2022.9965643, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) is used in many consumer IoE devices now because it offers the lowest average power for a radio that can communicate directly to a mobile device [1]. The BLE standard requires that the IoE device continuously advertises, which initiates the connection to a mobile device. Sub-1s advertisement intervals are common to minimize latency. However, this continuous advertising results in a typical minimum average power of 10's of μW at low duty-cycles. This leads to the quoted 1-year lifetimes of event-driven IoE devices (e.g. tracking tags, ibeacons) that operate from coin-cell batteries.

Last year the workshop was held virtually in Lyon, France. The workshop series aims to investigate the Web and Web applications’ role in establishing smart city (SC) promises. The workshop series aim to investigate the role of the Web and of Web applications in SC growth. This year, the workshop focuses on the role of the web in social coherence. cities appear to play a crucial role in securing humanity against social threats and generating sustainable and circular cities. In this regard, cities attempt to secure social sustainability and coherence (e.g., deal with affordable energy, poverty, hunger, equal opportunities in education, jobs, and health, etc.) and enhance their performance to become friendlier and able to host their increasing populations. Additionally, new types of business appear (e.g., for smart energy), while the co-existence of autonomous things and people generate another challenge that cities have started phasing.

4852844eb7202466bb11d6d32fee6b92aa958854,Enhancing Predictive Accuracy: Assessing the Effectiveness of SVM in Predicting Medical Student Performance,"The high cost of pursuing a medical education necessitates effectively monitoring and evaluating medical students' performance. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a prediction system for medical students’ national exam scores using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The dataset consisted of grades from first and second-year medical students at Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta, specifically from the 2014 and 2015 classes, to predict the final year exam score. The methodology involved data acquisition, data preprocessing, and classification and prediction of student performance. Remarkably, the SVM model achieved an accuracy rate of 95.48%. The findings highlight the substantial potential of SVM for accurately predicting medical student performance. The prediction system can enable educational institutions to proactively identify students needing additional support or intervention. This early intervention can help improve academic progress and enhance the overall quality of medical education. Future research efforts should focus on improving the prediction system's practicality and effectiveness by incorporating additional factors. This study successfully developed and evaluated a prediction system for medical student performance using the SVM algorithm. The high accuracy achieved by the SVM model emphasises its potential as a valuable tool for medical education institutions. By leveraging machine learning, educational institutions can provide targeted support to students, leading to improved learning outcomes and advancements in medical education.",E3S Web of Conferences,2023.0,0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2023/102/e3sconf_icimece2023_02028.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1051/e3sconf/202346502028?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202346502028, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

44f7c800d25386b46651e7cd962316a47d2a443b,Programming: predicting student success early in CS1. a re-validation and replication study,"This paper describes a large, multi-institutional revalidation study conducted in the academic year 2015-16. Six hundred and ninety-two students participated in this study, from 11 institutions (ten institutions in Ireland and one in Denmark). The primary goal was to validate and further develop an existing computational prediction model called Predict Student Success (PreSS). In doing so, this study addressed a call from the 2015 ITiCSE working group (the second ”Grand Challenge”), to ”systematically analyse and verify previous studies using data from multiple contexts to tease out tacit factors that contribute to previously observed outcomes”. PreSS was developed and validated in a longitudinal study conducted over a three year period (twelve years previous from 2004-06). PreSS could predict with near 80% accuracy, how a student would likely perform on an introductory programming module. Notably this could be achieved at a very early stage in the module. This paper describes a revalidation of the original PreSS model on a significantly larger multi-institutional data set twelve years after its initial development and looks at recent research on additional factors that may improve the model. The work involved the development of a fully automated end-to-end tool, which can predict student success early in CS1, with an accuracy of 71%. This paper describes, in detail the PreSS model, recent research, pilot studies and the re-validation and replication study of the PreSS model.",Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,2018.0,50,3,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3197091.3197101?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3197091.3197101, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Some sources predict the number of tens and hundreds billion connected devices for the year 2020–2025. One of the most popular standard machine-to-machine application layer protocols to interconnect the things and applications to the Internet of Things is Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol. Quality of service (QoS) deal with network performance elements like latency, error rate and uptime. MQTT provides three levels of QoS. Usage time of IoT devices is constrained by its most critical resource - battery. This paper deals with the estimation of energy consumption in transferring data using lightweight MQTT protocol over it different QoS levels.

9dbab0974c4ad4b6623f95a581bf246ba53d52f7,"Inspection, Measurement and Interpretation of Club Convergence of Water Use Efficiency in China from 2003 to 2015","Based on Quah’s (1997) analysis framework about distribution dynamics and using the extended Markov chain model and the spatial Markov chain model, this paper studies the phenomenon of club convergence of total water use, agricultural water use and industrial water use in 31 provinces of mainland China from 2003 to 2015. Firstly, it manages to inspect the club convergence of three types of water use efficiency, then measures the degree of club convergence based on the constructed club convergence index, and finally explains the phenomenon of this kind of club convergence in view of space. The results are as follows. (1) The phenomenon of club convergence exists among the three types of water use. While its convergence degree eases with time, it is still very obvious. For example, the probability that areas with low industrial water use efficiency remain low after 5 year lengths is 0.808, while that is 0.918 when it comes to high-level areas, so it is urgent that the regional water use efficiency effort should be coordinated. (2) The degree of club convergence of industrial water use efficiency is the highest among the three ones, followed by the total water use and then the agricultural water use. More seriously, some areas remain low-level for a long time and they are caught in a “low-level trap”, which should be taken great consideration by the government. (3) The phenomenon of club convergence is influenced by spatial factors. On the one hand, when the water use efficiency among areas is different, the local areas tend to be influenced by the adjacent areas to some extent. Simple to say, high-level adjacent areas have positive impact while low-level ones are opposite. On the other hand, there exists a characteristic of agglomeration no matter it is among high-level districts or lowlevel districts in spatial distribution, so spatial spillover effect follows among different clubs. However, the positive spillover effect in high level clubs is much larger than that in low level clubs, which incurs greater difference between high-low-level clubs so as to promote the phenomenon of club convergence. This is particularly evident in the club convergence of industrial water use in China.

aa96944f002e97690a05006490b25c5887cfcb56,An Overview of the Development of a GPU with Integrated HBM on Silicon Interposer,"In recent years, the 2.5D IC (Integrated Circuit) package with TSV (Through Silicon Vias) has become important for high-bandwidth and high-performance applications. It is well known that 2.5D technology requires significant innovation in the areas of process technology, packaging, design, thermals, and test solutions leading to several hundred new technologies in a single product. With these complex material sets and process steps combined with new design requirements, methods, and components, a significant amount of research and engineering development is required to bring a successful product to market. After an 8 year development, in July of 2015 AMD reported it began shipment of a new generation of AMD Radeon Fury graphics cards, based on the development of the ""Fiji"" GPU and the first generation of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM1). This announcement is the next major step in an era for 2.5D IC package technology which will be used in a wide variety of applications. Given the scope of this undertaking many collaborations were required. This paper provides an overview of the collaboration between AMD and ASE. It chronicles the work from initial proof of concept to technology feasibility to product development to production ramp and ultimately high volume production. Details of several functional prototypes are outlined including warpage characterization, stress reduction, materials selection methodologies, and the use of finite element analysis (FEA) and advanced Warpage Metrology Analyzer (WMA) for optimization. The result is a reliable 2.5D process flow with >99% assembly yield for a 1011mm2 interposer with 5 dies attached in a 300+W 55x55mm2 package.",Electronic Components and Technology Conference,2016.0,100,3,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ECTC.2016.348?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2016.348, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

1dba5786120b9a63a1eb2793c8de82199a7fcbf6,The Prediction of Municipal Water Demand in Iraq: A Case Study of Baghdad Governorate,"Accurate prediction of short-term water demand plays an important role for water suppliers as well as for government's water plan. This paper aims to predict a municipal water demand for an upcoming year based on previous water consumption in Baghdad city. We have investigated various signal processing approaches to address the noisy time series data of water consumption, while a new methodology for short-term prediction of municipal water consumption has been proposed. This would enable us to forecast the short-term municipal water demand using different windows and multi-stages of hybrid univariate singular spectrum analysis and autoregressive model (SSA-AR model). First, different windows and multi-stages of SSA are utilised to analyse and clean the original water time series from noise. Then, the autoregressive (AR) model is employed to predict water demand based on the treated water consumption time series. In this study, monthly water consumption data from (2006-2015) for Al-Wehda treatment plant in Baghdad city, Iraq is selected to assess the model. The findings show that (SSA-AR model) can predict water demand with high accuracy from high noisy raw data.",International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering,2019.0,77,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/DeSE.2019.00058?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/DeSE.2019.00058, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

By the year 2025, it is projected that there will be a need for 380,000 caregivers. One of Caregivers' compulsory tasks consists in checking diapers every 2 hours both during the day and at night. It becomes even more burdensome when they must also do this around or after midnight, depriving them of quality sleep. The use of excretion detector devices may provide a solution to this problem. However, there are sanitary limitations to the recovery and reuse of such devices. Additionally, there is obvious discomfort that comes with attaching a large device to a diaper. To address this challenge, the disposability, and ultra-thinness of the device presented in this study are paramount.

022307dce8fbd454dafaed27c7974d474dce98d1,Load Balancing in Cloud Computing Environment,"Cloud computing has many advantages over traditional computing like scalability, elasticity, accessibility. Due to these advantages, it has gained popularity in the Information Technology industry. The popularity of cloud computing has forced all organizations (including Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) to move their businesses from traditional computing to cloud computing. This transition has increased cloud-based services worldwide. The worldwide cloud market is set to surpass $330 billion USD in the year 2020 and is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 17.5% from 2020 to 2025. The growth in cloud adoption has resulted in a high surge of network traffic. Failure to handle this enormous traffic may result in reduced system performance, inefficient resource utilization, server outage. One of the solutions for these problems is cloud load balancers. The cloud load balancers improve system performance by distributing load among all available resources.The research work is carried out to build a new general load balancing algorithm and also extends the ability of another algorithm in the natural phenomena based category. Finally, the two new proposed algorithms are tested under the clustering environments.Popular algorithms like Throttled, Active Monitoring, etc. in the category general Load Balancing have drawbacks of longer search time and inefficient resource utilization. To decrease search time and improve resource utilization an algorithm named Capacity Based Load Balancing (CBLB) is proposed in the general category. The algorithm is implemented and analyzed using CloudSim simulator and Amazon Web Services (AWS) real cloud environments. In both environments, the performance is examined for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous setups. In both setups, the performance parameters makespan, average response time, and throughput are considered for the analysis of the results. The proposed algorithm is compared with the popular Throttled algorithm. Besides, the adaptability of the algorithm is tested for the varied number of Datacenters (DCs), a varied number of Virtual Machines (VMs), and varied capacity VMs. The CPU utilization of the algorithms is also checked by using the cloud watch of AWS to ensure effective utilization of resources. The proposed algorithm has shown better performance than the Throttled in both simulation and real cloud environments for all the parameters.The proposed CBLB algorithm is used to enhance the popular natural phenomena-based Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The performance of the enhanced ABC algorithm named ABC_CBLB is compared with the basic ABC algorithm. The experiments are carried out for homogeneous and heterogeneous setups in both CloudSim and AWS platforms. The performance is tested for the varied number of DCs and varied number of VM. In these experiments in addition to the parameters makespan, average response time, throughput, and CPU utilization, the average waiting time is considered. Under all variations and environments, ABC_CBLB has shown an improved performance compared to the basic ABC algorithm.Clustering is a technique that improves performance and resource utilization. Clustering allows parallel execution of cloudlets which in turn reduces total execution time and improves throughput. Hence, an attempt has been made to use clusters to improve the performance of the proposed CBLB and ABC_CBLB algorithms. The popular K-mean clustering algorithm is used to perform clustering. Clustered CBLB and ABC_CBLB are compared with the Throttled and ABC (both with and without a cluster). All the algorithms have shown significant improvement with the usage of a cluster in comparison to a non-clustered environment. The implementation of the algorithms is done in the CloudSim simulator. The simulation results are analyzed for the parameters makespan, throughput, and average response time. The optimal cluster number was identified by taking readings for different k-values of the K-mean. Additionally, the identified k-value was verified using the Elbow method. Further, the performance is also verified for the changed number of VMs. In addition to this, the performance of ABC_CBLB with clustering is compared with the existing algorithms Load Balancing based on Bayes and Clustering (LB_BC) and Load Balancing Resource Clustering (LB_RC).The proposed algorithms CBLB and ABC_CBLB have shown an improvement over the existing popular algorithms in both simulation and real cloud implementations. An attempt to use the clustering technique with these algorithms has also shown an improvement in the performance over existing algorithms.","2022 IEEE International Conference for Women in Innovation, Technology & Entrepreneurship (ICWITE)",2022.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICWITE57052.2022.10176241?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWITE57052.2022.10176241, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

617aeb7523e26c04b8d9308e8fcc727c50f35c58,Cassava Leaf Disease Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Cassava is a plant that is widely found in Indonesia with various benefits. One of the benefits of cassava is as a substitute for rice. According to data from the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency in 2015, cassava production in Indonesia was 21,801,415 tons a year. Lampung Province is the largest producer of cassava in Indonesia. In 2016, its production decreased due to disease attacking the cassava plant. One of the deep learning methods currently being developed is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This network is built with the assumption that the input used is an image. This technique can make the image learning function more efficient to implement. Therefore, this study will take advantage of the advantages of CNN, namely being able to classify an object intended for image data so that the CNN model will be used as an introduction to the four types of healthy cassava leaf and cassava leaf diseases that can be found in Indonesia. By using the Tensorflow library, the results of model trials and evaluations of cassava leaf images show an accuracy of 0.8538 for training and 0.7496 for data validation. So it can be concluded that the implementation of Deep Learning with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method can detect cassava leaf disease images.",International Conference on Science in Information Technology,2020.0,32,3,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICSITech49800.2020.9392051?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSITech49800.2020.9392051, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

377d767fe4bf529e3937fc6e8c46e6867e946265,Why are Android Apps Removed From Google Play? A Large-Scale Empirical Study,"To ensure the quality and trustworthiness of the apps within its app market (i.e., Google Play), Google has released a series of policies to regulate app developers. As a result, policy-violating apps (e.g., malware, low-quality apps, etc.) have been removed by Google Play periodically. In reality, we have found that the number of removed apps are actually much more than what we have expected, as almost half of all the apps have been removed or replaced from Google Play during a two year period from 2015 to 2017. However, despite the significant number of removed apps, there are almost no study on the characterization of these removed apps. To this end, this paper takes the first step to understand why Android apps are removed from Google Play, aiming at observing promising insights for both market maintainers and app developers towards building a better app ecosystem. By leveraging two app sets crawled from Google Play in 2015 (over 1.5 million) and 2017 (over 2.1 million), we have identified a set of over 790K removed apps, which are then thoroughly investigated in various aspects. The experimental results have revealed various interesting findings, as well as insights for future research directions.",IEEE Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories,2018.0,64,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3196398.3196412?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3196398.3196412, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0d595853110c799d61d2262f957639b1b849b992,Electric Vehicle Impact Assessment on Distribution Network of Phuentsholing,"This project studies the effects of charging electric vehicles on Phuentsholing's distribution network at various penetration levels. In the DIgSILENT power factory, an existing network was modeled and an analysis was performed for the aggregated domestic load with EV load based on two potential scenarios: low and high levels of uptake of EVs. The charging pattern of an electric vehicle may vary depending on the user's preferences. Two sub-EV charging scenarios (all EV charging at the same time and 50% of EV charging at the same time) were studied to analyze the impact. The scenarios are being formulated in consultation with the distribution engineers. Voltage stability and transformer loading are two significant areas that were assessed. The result indicated a technical violation in the year 2025 under high uptake when all EVs charged at the same time. Further, a worse case was observed in the year 2030, with high uptake, when all EVs charged at the same time. Low voltage issues and transformer overloading were the main causes of network instability. Random quick charger loads on distribution feeders contribute to load unbalance at the feeder level, whereas home chargers cause phase unbalance and voltage dips at the household level. These findings suggest that high EV penetration has a considerable impact on the optimal operation of a distribution system. A mitigation strategy for voltage correction and transformer loading has been presented based on the simulation results","International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications",2022.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/SKIMA57145.2022.10029476?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/SKIMA57145.2022.10029476, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is expected that SG can link directly the museum content with target user groups and can fulfill their educational needs. This paper aims to present a systematic mapping study on modern museum gaming technologies and applications. More specifically, focus is given on the use of Serious Games (SGs) by the visitors during exhibition navigation and exploration of museum's cultural and educational content. Major analysis criteria and review findings include game goals, purpose of use, scope, user acceptance and educational effectiveness. A pool of 48 quality literature publications were set under examination. It was found that most solutions were game-based than play-based and that both genres had educational benefits on offer. Also, the frequency of relevant publications per year was increasing from year 2009 up to 2015. Regarding scope, studied applications were split almost equally among education, culture and arts, while the overwhelming majority were targeted to the general public and not teachers, students or parents specifically.

3abd40f05f302d0bfa37e9ae860d089096d3aff0,PreSS: Predicting Student Success Early in CS1. A Pilot International Replication and Generalization Study,"This work piloted an international replication and generalization study on an existing prediction model called PreSS. PreSS has been developed and validated over nearly two decades and can predict student performance in CS1 with nearly 71% accuracy, at a very early stage in the learning module. Motivated by a prior validation study and its competitive modelling accuracy, we chose PreSS for such an international replication and generalization study. The study took place in two countries, with two institutions in Ireland and one institution in the US, totalling 472 students throughout the academic year 2020-21. In doing so, this study addressed a call from the 2015 ITiCSE working group for the educational data mining and learning analytics community: systematically analyse and verify previous studies using data from multiple contexts to tease out tacit factors that contribute to previously observed outcomes. This pilot study achieved 90% accuracy, which is higher than the prior work's. This encouraging finding sets the foundations for a larger scale international study. This paper describes in detail the pilot replication and generalization study and our progress on the larger scale study which is taking place across six continents.",Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,2022.0,7,0,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3502718.3524755', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3502718.3524755?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3502718.3524755, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c3346688b4d3c3e3258f292244327063e748a555,Devanagari Handwritten Character Recognition using CNN as Feature Extractor,"This paper proposes the use of Convolutional Neural Networks as feature extractor for extraction of features from handwritten Devanagari characters. For classification, classifiers employed are SVM (Linear, Polynomial and RBF), KNN, RF, DT, MLP and XGB. Use of CNN model for feature extraction eliminates the need of handcrafted features by traditional pattern recognition methods. XGB Classifier, which is a very recent technique, has also been explored (which has not been done previously to the best of our knowledge). The experiments with these eight techniques have been done on the DHCD dataset proposed in year 2015.

8c2e5fcb2252e44b3a96aece6c5ae28044e60065,Personalized Diabetes Care System in the Cloud with Predictive Technology for the Medical Sector: A Study,"According to recent research, approximately 3.9 million people who are at the age of 18 years old and above are diagnosed with diabetes in Malaysia. This means that there will be 1 adult in 5 who is diagnosed with diabetes. The prevalence rate has increased from 13.4% in the year 2015 to 18.3% in the year 2019. This research aims to raise awareness for fellow Malaysians about diabetes and provide additional functionality for personal care and healthcare professionals to better manage their resources as healthcare resources are extremely scarce especially during the pandemic. The proposed solution will include a workout live stream plan and diet suggestion as well as manage any enquiries to any user or diabetes patient with the use of Artificial Intelligence Chat Bot to provide a simple yet informational solution. The system will also utilize predictive analysis models to predict the trend and probability of patient developing diabetes thus, providing visualization through charts to provide insights about their personal health or diabetes trend for both patients and medical professionals to better manage their time and resources. Several surveys associated with the proposed system were undertaken as part of this research. Research findings suggest that the proposed system is necessary for both diabetics and the medical sector.",2022 3rd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC),2022.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICOSEC54921.2022.9951925?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSEC54921.2022.9951925, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a3fdf68a8e12f756f994ff5c9817d58c18bf9e6c,A Quantitative Assessment of Emerging Trends in IoT Botnet Attacks,"In recent years, the world has witnessed a great increase in IoT Botnet attacks. Since these IoT devices are heterogeneous and typically resource-constrained with less processing and memory resources available to employ an efficient security mechanism. Moreover, the attack vectors and malicious adversaries have become advanced both in terms of complexity and diversity. This implies an effective mechanism to efficiently identify and prevent IoT Botnet attacks. This study aims to present a methodological quantitative assessment of the research conducted in the area of IoT Botnets from the year 2015 to 2022. Typically, the ISI Web of Science (WoS) along with VOSviewer (a software tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks) are used to conduct the overall bibliometric assessment. Our assessment shows that the research in this area encompasses multiple domains with the USA leading in terms of research publication with English as the leading language. This bibliometric assessment provides an in-depth quantitative analysis based on the 9 research questions formulated during our research. This consequently helps the research community to collaborate with other researchers, institutions and funding agencies to make further progress in this area.",Iconics,2022.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICONICS56716.2022.10100587?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICONICS56716.2022.10100587, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The researchers conducted a case study that involved 27,000 information (3000 observations and 9 features) of students' Mock Job Interview Evaluation Results, On-the Job Training (OJT) Student Performance Rating and General Point Average (GPA) of students enrolled in OJT course of School Year 2015 to School Year 2018. Three learning algorithms were used such as Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Support vector machine (SVM) in order to understand how students get employed. The three algorithms were evaluated through the performance matrix as accuracy measures, precision and recall measures, f1-score and support measures. During the experiments Support Vector machine (SVM) obtained 91.22% in accuracy measures which was significantly better than all of the learning algorithms, DT 85%, RF 84%. The learning curve produced during the experiment displays the training error results which were above the one for validation error while the validation curve displays the testing output where gamma was best at 10 to 100 in gamma 5. This concludes that the model produced with SVM was not underfit and over-fit. This study is very promising that lead to the researchers to be motivated to enhanced the process and to validate the produced predictive model for further study.",2019 IEEE 6th International Conference on Engineering Technologies and Applied Sciences (ICETAS),2019.0,25,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICETAS48360.2019.9117338?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETAS48360.2019.9117338, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This big data includes information such as patient records and provider payments. The use of big data is often considered the best way to produce effective models in areas such as fraud detection. In this study, we demonstrate that the use of more highly imbalanced big data does not produce acceptable fraud detection results. We use random undersampling to generate seven different class distributions and compare performance results. We use the 2012- 2015 Calendar Year Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data mapping actual fraud labels from the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE). Our results, based on building Random Forest models using 5-fold cross-validation, demonstrate that 90:10 is the best class distribution with an 0.87302 AUC, whereas the balanced and two highly imbalanced distributions produced the worst fraud detection performance. Furthermore, we show that the commonly used ratio of 50:50 (balanced) was not significantly better than using a 99:1 (imbalanced) class distribution. Our study clearly demonstrates the need to apply at least some sampling to big data with class imbalance and suggests the 50:50 class distribution does not produce the best Medicare fraud detection results.",IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration,2018.0,54,3,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IRI.2018.00019?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2018.00019, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0f87ee613a4d2575b99c0be8657ec353c0680306,P2DPI: Practical and Privacy-Preserving Deep Packet Inspection,"The amount of encrypted Internet traffic almost doubles every year thanks to the wide adoption of end-to-end traffic encryption solutions such as IPSec, TLS and SSH. Despite all the benefits of user privacy the end-to-end encryption provides, the encrypted internet traffic blinds intrusion detection system (IDS) and makes detecting malicious traffic hugely difficult. The resulting conflict between the user's privacy and security has demanded solutions for deep packet inspection (DPI) over encrypted traffic. The approach of those solutions proposed to date is still restricted in that they require intensive computations during connection setup or detection. For example, BlindBox, introduced by Sherry et al. (SIGCOMM 2015) enables inspection over the TLS-encrypted traffic without compromising users' privacy, but its usage is limited due to a significant delay on establishing an inspected channel. PrivDPI, proposed more recently by Ning et al. (ACM CCS 2019), improves the overall efficiency of BlindBox and makes the inspection scenario more viable. Despite the improvement, we show in this paper that the user privacy of Ning et al.'s PrivDPI can be compromised entirely by the rule generator without involving any other parties, including the middlebox. Having observed the difficulties of realizing efficiency and security in the previous work, we propose a new DPI system for encrypted traffic, named ""Practical and Privacy-Preserving Deep Packet Inspection (P2DPI)''.

68a443cbf76a4d9b23635d568e72b66c75542426,Insight into Voting Problem Complexity Using Randomized Classes,"The first step in classifying the complexity of an NP problem is typically showing the problem in P or NP-complete. This has been a successful first step for many problems, including voting problems. However, in this paper we show that this may not always be the best first step. We consider the problem of constructive control by replacing voters (CCRV) introduced by Loreggia et al. [2015, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2772879.2773411] for the scoring rule First-Last, which is defined by (1, 0, ..., 0, -1). We show that this problem is equivalent to Exact Perfect Bipartite Matching, and so CCRV for First-Last can be determined in random polynomial time. So on the one hand, if CCRV for First-Last is NP-complete then RP = NP, which is extremely unlikely. On the other hand, showing that CCRV for First-Last is in P would also show that Exact Perfect Bipartite Matching is in P, which would solve a well-studied 40-year-old open problem.



Considering RP as an option for classifying problems can also help classify problems that until now had escaped classification. For example, the sole open problem in the comprehensive table from Erdélyi et al. [2021, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10458-021-09523-9] is CCRV for 2-Approval. We show that this problem is in RP, and thus easy since it is widely assumed that P = RP.",International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2022.0,5,0,"{'url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12856', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12856, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ed2b322990ba470b86d321fc3d8770637e110e87,"Insights on Gender Differences in CS1: A Multi-institutional, Multi-variate Study.","This paper describes a multivariate, multi-institutional study conducted in the academic year 2015-16. Six hundred and ninety-three students participated from 11 institutions, (ten institutions in Ireland and one in Denmark). The goal of the study was to compare the profile of male and female students enrolled on introductory programming modules (CS1), to determine if any significant differences could be identified by gender. The gender split was 79:21, male to female respectively. The study took place early in the CS1 module with three instruments used to capture data: a background survey, a survey on programming self-efficacy, comfort and anxiety, and a short programming test. At the end of the module, the overall result for each participant was gathered. Of importance, the study was conducted across multiple levels of Computer Science education, from Level 5 Certificate up to and including Honors Bachelor Degree and Higher Diploma, (which are based on the Irish National Framework of Qualifications NFQ). This paper describes the approach taken and the detailed analysis performed. Several significant differences between male and female students were identified early in CS1, some of which did not hold true at the end of the module. A gender comparison between the two participating countries and the different institution types was also performed and discussed.

3aea8ad8c24d8f08e76cb61fef6a9318f7f67886,Kangaroo Vehicle Collision Detection Using Deep Semantic Segmentation Convolutional Neural Network,"Kangaroo vehicle collisions are a serious problem threatening the safety of the drivers on Australian roads. It is estimated, according to a recent report by Australian Associated Motor Insurers, that there are around 20,000 kangaroo vehicle collisions during year 2015 in Australia. As a result, more than AU $75 million in insurance claims, and a number of animal and human severe injuries and fatalities have been reported. Despite how catastrophic these numbers are, yet a little research has been done in order to avoid or minimise the number of kangaroo vehicle collisions. In this work, we are focusing on the problem of recognising and detecting kangaroos in dynamic environments using a deep semantic segmentation convolutional neural network model. Our model is trained on a synthetic labelled depth images obtained using a simulated range sensor. Our approach records average recall value of over 93% in semantically segmenting any number of kangaroos in the generated testing dataset.",International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications,2016.0,29,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/DICTA.2016.7797057?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2016.7797057, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

13d4c8bbc40b98738b5bead4f1c1f2f1e84a083f,Computational Thinking for All: An Experience Report on Scaling up Teaching Computational Thinking to All Students in a Major City in Sweden,"The Swedish government has recently introduced digital competence including programming in the Swedish K-9 curriculum starting no later than fall 2018. This means that 100 000 teachers need to learn programming and digital competence in less than a year. In this paper we report on our experience working with professional teacher training in Sweden's fifth largest city. The city has about 150 000 inhabitants and about 50 schools with about 14 000 students in primary education. The project has been carried out in close cooperation with the municipality. The work started in the fall of 2014 with a pilot study with 10 teachers in different subjects that was carried out during spring 2015. The pilot study was successful as the teachers were able to introduce activities related to programming and computational thinking in their subjects after only two half day workshops. The next step was to scale this up to include all the schools in the city. As expected, this turned out to be a larger challenge. More than 70 teachers were involved in the second part of the project. Some of the lessons learned are that it is quite easy to provide teacher training, but harder to get teachers to actually change their teaching and even more challenging to get teachers to help their colleagues introduce programming or computational thinking in their teaching. Based on our experience we draw some general conclusions and make suggestions for how to scale up the teaching of programming and computational thinking to all.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2018.0,48,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3159450.3159586?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3159450.3159586, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This paper describes a fruitful collaboration to create and teach an alternative introductory computing curriculum for high school students targeted at introducing students to computing via an artistic context. This curriculum allows students to be introduced to computing in a highly interest based context, attracting diverse student body participation (25% female students in the first offering and 38% female students in the present 2015-16 offering). This curriculum also fulfills student's fine art course requirement making it more readily accessible to a wide audience to `try out' CS while making progress on their academic goals. This curriculum has been used as a successful introduction to computing at the Santa Barbara High School CS Academy in the 2014-2015 school year and is currently being offered again this year.

af1b77d641c760c7ff93043fb194b28ccb8167db,Habbaniyah Land Cover Change Detection Using Geoinformatics,"The study area was chosen within the district of Habbaniyah city with an area of 12320 hectares. In order to detect the change in the predominant ground covers and classify the soils of the study area. Using remote sensing and geographic information systems. For the Landsat 7 and 8 satellites, path 169 and Row 37, for the ETM+ sensor for the year 2007 and 2011, and for the OLI sensor for the year 2015 and 2020. All parts of the study area were covered by semi-detailed soil surveying with Free Lance method, And nine pedons were determined and determined by GPS. The results showed that the classification of soils in the study area included two order of soils: Entisols and Aridisols. Four main classes of land cover were identified: barren land, vegetation cover, Urban Lands and water. As the area of barren lands in 2007 was 6417.5 hectares, 54.09%, accompanied by a decrease in vegetation cover during 2007, with an area of 4360.6 hectares, 35.39%. It was also noted that there was an increase in the areas of Urban Land represented by Urban sprawl, as it was during 2007 with an area of 1104.8 hectares, or 8.97% While it increased during the year 2020, reaching 1927.4 hectares, at a rate of 15.64%, and this is a serious indicator of the desertification of agricultural lands due to Urban sprawl and the transformation of agricultural lands into residential areas. Water bodies decreased during the year 2011 at a rate of 6.3 hectares/year, while the amount of the decrease during the year 2020 was about 2.3 hectares/year due to water scarcity, the construction of dams and the reduction of water flow towards Iraqi lands. It also notes a slight increase in the areas of vegetation cover during the year 2020, at a rate of 5.6 hectares/year, which is very small compared to the area of the study area. While it reached its peak at a rate of 27.1 hectares/year during the year 2011. We also note an increase in Urban sprawl during the year 2020, as it was an increase of 5.7 hectares/year and on a continuous basis.",IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environment,2021.0,4,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/904/1/012037', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1755-1315/904/1/012037?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/904/1/012037, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e017d902d4537ecac026b2af7008f9bb583c63ff,EBB: Reliable and Evolvable Express Backbone Network in Meta,"We present the design, implementation, evaluation, deployment and production experiences of EBB (Express BackBone), a private WAN (Wide Area Network) connecting Meta's global data centers (DCs). Initiated in 2015, EBB now carries 100% of DC-DC traffic, witnessing remarkable growth over the years. A key design aspect of EBB is its multi-plane architecture, facilitating seamless deployment of a new control plane while ensuring operational simplicity. This architecture allows for efficient failure mitigation, standard maintenance, and capacity expansion by draining one or two planes without impacting service level objectives (SLOs). Another critical design decision is the hybrid model, combining distributed control agents and a central controller. EBB's centralized traffic engineering utilizes an MPLS-TE based solution to allocate paths periodically for different traffic classes based on service requirements, while its distributed control agents enable fast local failure recovery by pre-installing pre-computed backup paths in the data plane. We delve into our eight-year production experience, highlighting the successful deployment of multiple generations of EBB.","Conference on Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication",2023.0,11,0,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3603269.3604860', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3603269.3604860?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3603269.3604860, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We extract both passenger-delivery and passenger-searching trip information from GPS trajectories and evaluate taxi drivers' working conditions. Our results reveal that the taxi industry was adversely influenced by the competition between transportation network companies, as compared to that of 2012, the average passenger-delivery trip number per day per taxi dropped by 18.08% and the average daily profit per taxi dropped by 19.29% in year 2015, respectively. We also compare passenger-searching strategies, passenger-delivery strategies, and service area preferences between taxi drivers with top and bottom efficiencies in different time periods. We find that compared to drivers with lower efficiencies, drivers with high efficiencies tend to search locally, have a faster delivery speed, and serve within the central part of Beijing.",2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC),2017.0,22,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317622?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317622, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These libraries are essential to the Android app development ecosystem as they often provide vital functionality that would take significant development time to implement otherwise. Researchers have mainly studied the prevalence and updates of third-party libraries in Android apps. However, no prior work investigates the adoption percentages of third-party libraries in apps and how they evolve. It remains unknown whether there are any patterns in third-party libraries' adoption percentages in Android apps. In this study, we empirically investigate the adoption of third-party libraries in 2,997 open-source Android apps over a six-year study period (2015–2020). We collected 39,882 commits from repositories hosting the target apps, and identified all changes to the adoption percentages of third-party libraries in each app. We then calculated the adoption percentage of each library in each app over specific time periods. Using the collected data, we report adoption statistics of popular libraries, propose a new taxonomy to characterize their evolutionary patterns, investigate the adoption percentages of third-party libraries across different app categories, and explore the groups of libraries that have similar release patterns and version-level adoption patterns. Our findings provide insight on third-party library adoption in open-source Android apps and thus might help researchers create tools to improve the library adoption in mobile apps.",International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems,2022.0,2,0,"{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3524613.3527810', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3524613.3527810?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3524613.3527810, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is also essential to monitor the progress as well as the failures to ensure well-informed decisions are implemented for e-waste management. Although, there exist many platforms exist to deal with the e-waste issues, but the concept of Artificial Intelligence can aid in faster and more effective e-waste management. The concept of Artificial Intelligence is relatively a newer concept which utilized various techniques for segregation into recycling of e-waste. The proposed study focuses on reviewing the past years papers from year 2015 to present for understanding the role of Artificial Intelligence in e-waste management. The paper also illustrates the scope of Artificial Intelligence in the management of e-waste in the coming time. In this paper we have employed Data Extraction and Synergy methodology to collect the data and write the review of papers by doing the analysis through graphs on the same basis. The opportunity associated with this is that the use of computational techniques is highly effective in the segregation of e-waste and the techniques also provide an effective vital routine in solving the heuristic problems related to E-waste in an effective manner.

It constitutes a severe challenge for public health worldwide. As stated by the International Diabetes Federation, there are presently about 246 million diabetic people around the world, and this number is anticipated to increase to around 380 million by the year 2025. More than this, 3.8 million death cases occur annually due to diabetes complications. The primary objective of this work is developing an applicable system to predict diabetes using distributed machine learning based on big data platforms such as Spark. In this context, this study aims to develop models using distributed machine learning based on Apache Spark to predict diabetes. Five machine learning classification methods were used like Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classifier. Comparison between different algorithms was calculated using three measures, which are accuracy, recall, and precision. The experimental results proposed that LR achieved the highest percentage of accuracy, recall, and precision,82%, 92%, and 82%, respectively.",2020 International Conference on Innovative Trends in Communication and Computer Engineering (ITCE),2020.0,8,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ITCE48509.2020.9047795?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ITCE48509.2020.9047795, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

df52bb25b4739982f8dd9d762917a3c82f2da999,Detecting Underwater Sea Litter Using Deep Neural Networks: An Initial Study,"The world’s seas and the oceans are under constant negative pressure caused by human activity. It is estimated that more than 150 million tonnes of litter will be accumulated in the world’s oceans until 2025, while up to 12.7 million tonnes of litter will be added to the sea every year. Besides ecology-related issues, marine litter can also hurt the economy of the affected areas. Detection and classification of sea litter thus becomes a first step in tracking the litter and consequently a basis for the development of any automatic or human-based marine litter retrieval system.Modern convolutional neural networks are a logical choice for detection and classification algorithms since they have proven themselves time after time in image-based machine learning tasks. Nevertheless, according to the available literature, the application of such neural networks in underwater images for marine litter detection (and classification) has started just recently. Thus, the paper carries out an initial study on the performance of such detection and classification system constructed in several ways and with several architectures, as well as using several sources of training data. It is shown that obtained validation accuracy is around 88% and test accuracy around 85%, depending on the used architecture, and that inclusion of synthetically generated images reduces the network performance on real-world image dataset.",2020 5th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech),2020.0,9,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.23919/SpliTech49282.2020.9243709?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.23919/SpliTech49282.2020.9243709, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There are different approaches for plagiarism detection currently being researched. This paper aims to answer the question: What does the literature report on source code plagiarism detection in university settings? To answer that, we used a systematic mapping process of recent literature. We selected 109 papers published between 2015 and 2020 that deal with this subject specifically in an educational context. We found that this research area is currently expanding and being studied worldwide. There were papers from 37 different countries, and the number of publications per year has been increasing since 2017. The most targeted programming languages are Java, C++, C, and Python. The most studied plagiarism detection tools are MOSS, JPlag, SIM, Plaggie, and Sherlock. Our study also identified new methodologies created to tackle this problem, such as the analysis of students' typing patterns or their coding style. We noticed that the proposed solutions are mainly based on static source code analysis instead of following the development process.

9177d63aa6c94a31613de1b1c728172ad6fecedb,Improved Ackermannian Lower Bound for the Petri Nets Reachability Problem,"Petri nets, equivalently presentable as vector addition systems with states, are an established model of concurrency with widespread applications. The reachability problem, where we ask whether from a given initial configuration there exists a sequence of valid execution steps reaching a given final configuration, is the central algorithmic problem for this model. The complexity of the problem has remained, until recently, one of the hardest open questions in verification of concurrent systems. A first upper bound has been provided only in 2015 by Leroux and Schmitz, then refined by the same authors to non-primitive recursive Ackermannian upper bound in 2019. The exponential space lower bound, shown by Lipton already in 1976, remained the only known for over 40 years until a breakthrough non-elementary lower bound by Czerwi{\'n}ski, Lasota, Lazic, Leroux and Mazowiecki in 2019. Finally, a matching Ackermannian lower bound announced this year by Czerwi{\'n}ski and Orlikowski, and independently by Leroux, established the complexity of the problem. Our primary contribution is an improvement of the former construction, making it conceptually simpler and more direct. On the way we improve the lower bound for vector addition systems with states in fixed dimension (or, equivalently, Petri nets with fixed number of places): while Czerwi{\'n}ski and Orlikowski prove $F_k$-hardness (hardness for $k$th level in Grzegorczyk Hierarchy) in dimension $6k$, our simplified construction yields $F_k$-hardness already in dimension $3k+2$.",Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science,2021.0,11,2,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08551, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

13e2503bce4d63635f2df5244e650bdc61c8786e,A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Therapeutic Adherence to Osteoporosis Treatment,"Osteoporosis is a great disability burden with an expected cost increase of almost 50% by 2025. Due to its long term treatment, 50–70% of the patients withdraw from their osteoporosis medications within the first year of initiation. This necessitates an urgent need for improved osteoporosis and pharmacologic management tools most especially for pregnant women, postmenopausal women and the elderly to ensure therapeutic adherence of the patients during treatment. In this paper, we developed and tested accuracy of Machine Learning Models for predicting therapeutic adherence of patients to enable health professionals to compatibly decide on the therapeutic treatments and approaches for osteoporosis treatment and pharmacologic management of their patients. We were the first to develop and test Machine Learning Models for Predicting Therapeutic Adherence treatments. The ML Model accuracy results are summarized as classical metrics where the ExtraTree Model exhibited the highest accuracy of 100%, 85.0%, 94.5% on the training, testing and overall dataset respectively using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique Support Vector Machine Learning (SMOTE-SVM).",2021 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Data Engineering (CSDE),2021.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CSDE53843.2021.9718416?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CSDE53843.2021.9718416, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

61f04b6fd82f172ee1920708982a98078f6ee602,Analysis of Hybrid Model Error of Short-Term Forecast of Energy Consumption in Moscow,"For short-term forecast of daily active energy consumption graphs in Moscow, there is proposed a hybrid model based on the Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis algorithm and a Neural Fuzzy Network taking into account for factual and forecast data of air temperature and daylight illumination. In the hybrid model in the multichannel singular spectrum analysis module, the time series of energy consumption and meteorological factors are decomposed into independent components - forming its additive, trend, harmonic and random components used in the neural fuzzy network module. The source data were archives of time series of energy consumption, air temperature, cloud amount and daylight illumination for the Moscow territory from 2012 to 2016. The software implemented in the C# language was used as a modeling tool. Short-term forecasts of daily active energy consumption graphs were carried out during the year (from September 2015 to August 2016). In most test examples, the results of the forecast for a month are obtained within the limits of permissible errors. The proposed version of short-term forecast of daily active energy consumption graphs allows obtaining an error in the range from 1 - 2.3 % during the year. In addition, the developed algorithm makes it possible to use seasonal patterns between daily active energy consumption graphs and meteorological factors for several years.","International Conference on Industrial Engineering, Applications and Manufacturing",2021.0,13,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICIEAM51226.2021.9446344?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEAM51226.2021.9446344, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9a4885b83129f3ac6925202810960a39fb3741eb,MEMS for automotive and consumer electronics,"Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are sensing the environmental conditions and give input to electronic control systems. MEMS are miniature systems which usually combine tiny mechanical structures with electronic circuits. Typical MEMS structures have a size of a few micrometers. MEMS sensors make system reactions to human needs more intelligent, precise, and at much faster reaction rates than humanly possible. Today MEMS sensors can be found in nearly every motor vehicle, smart phone or laptop. Due to continuous product innovations, the sensors find their way into more and more applications in automotive and consumer electronics. According to IHS iSuppli an amount of 4.3 billion micromechanical sensors were sold in 2011 with an impressive increase to 9.8 billion sensors in 2015 - a growth rate of 23% per year. These growth rates are only possible with continuous efforts to improve the performance and to decrease the size, power consumption and costs of the sensors. Historically, these improvements have lead to the breakthrough to industrial mass production for MEMS. This was achieved over the last 20 years by intense and successful development activities combined with the experience of volume production of billions of sensors. Since then, MEMS technology has enabled accelerometers, gyroscopes, geomagnetic sensors, barometric pressure sensors, inkjet nozzles or micro-mirrors for Digital-Light Processing (DLP) projection systems. Driving future applications in consumer electronics will be Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI), Augmented Reality (AR) and in-door navigation.",European Solid-State Device Research Conference,2013.0,101,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ESSDERC.2013.6818809?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2013.6818809, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

With advancement in technology and emerging of various intelligent prediction techniques, it has now become possible to imbibe the traditional video surveillance with intelligence to identify or take decision according to the scenarios. Intelligent video surveillance system (IVS) based on image recognition is widely employed to effectively avert crimes and provide public security. Due to the high complexity of processing real time data and analysis/understanding of image contents, a well-developed user friendly and cost effective product is not present for use. This paper is an outcome of comparative analysis of extracts drawn from literature review of 57 IEEE papers ranging from year 1977 to the year 2015, carried out to understand the suspicious activity detection methodologies used for detecting abnormal human behavior, tracing abandoned object, or unattended baggage etc., which led to an extensive comparison between various proposed methods. Many technologies, mostly based on intelligent techniques like Neural Systems, Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine, Genetic Algorithm etc. emerged out as basis for intelligence in such systems.

4c72a51a7c7288e6e17dfefe4f87df47929608e7,"Automatic Face Recognition of Newborns, Infants, and Toddlers: A Longitudinal Evaluation","A number of emerging applications requiring reliable identification of children have called attention to whether biometric traits can be utilized as a solution. While biometric traits based on friction ridge patterns (e.g. fingerprints, footprints) have been evaluated to some extent, to our knowledge, no effort has been made to evaluate the efficacy of automatic face recognition of young children over useful durations of time. Additionally, there are some applications where only the face images of a child are available, such as identification of missing or abducted children and children shown in sexually exploitive media sequestered by law enforcement. In this paper, we introduce the Newborns, Infants, and Toddlers Longitudinal (NITL) face image database, which was collected by the authors during four different sessions over a period of one year (March 2015 to March 2016) at the Saran Ashram Hospital, Dayalbagh, India. The NITL database contains 314 subjects in total in the age range of 0 to 4 years old. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of a state-of-the-art commercial-off- the-shelf (COTS) face matcher on the NITL face image database to investigate the feasibility of face recognition of children as they age. Experimental results show that while available face recognition technology is not yet ready to reliably recognize very young children, face recognition enrolled at 3 years of age or older may be feasible.",Biometrics and Electronic Signatures,2016.0,42,3,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/BIOSIG.2016.7736912?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOSIG.2016.7736912, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Last year the workshop was held virtually in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The workshop series aims to investigate the Web and Web applications’ role in establishing smart city (SC) promises. The workshop series aim to investigate the role of the Web and of Web applications in SC growth. This year, the workshop focuses on the role of the web in smart environment. In the era of cities and under the UN 2030 Agenda and the European Green deal for sustainable growth, cities appear to play crucial role in securing humanity against environmental threats and generate sustainable and circular cities. In this regard, cities attempt to improve their forms (e.g., more compact, and eco-friendlier) and performance to become friendlier and able to host their increasing populations. Additionally, new types of business appear (e.g., that utilize IoT and data, manage e-waste and recycle), while the co-existence of autonomous things and people generate another challenge that cities have been started phasing.

0140a4bf4762c20ad489aaf1252bf3c44b756b4a,Building a Model and Assessing the Level of Morbidity During the Epidemic,"The article discusses the effectiveness, methods, and mathematical models of measures to control the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Kazakhstan. Data were obtained for a 10-year period of the incidence of HIV infection, and a distribution schedule for the morbidity of the population was created and analyzed using the Statistica application software package. A model of HIV spread is considered taking into account the social adaptation of the population, a scheme of a probabilistic model is constructed, and a system of probabilistic differential equations is used. The current direction of the strategy for combating HIV infection is largely determined by a scientifically based system for assessing the epidemiological state of HIV infection using mathematical models that can determine the patterns of the epidemiological process with great confidence and predict the expected level of morbidity.

The quantity of devices in IoT is increasing rapidly as it provides remote connectivity and data accessibility. As per the Statista, the connected things in IoT will be about 75 billion by the year 2025. This sudden rise in data generation in IoT will lead to drop in wireless network quality by aggravating delay, erroneous data, and loss of data. In case of healthcare IoT applications the prompt and accurate information is utmost important. The conceptual model of distributive wireless network architecture is proposed with the goal of improving quality of service offered by the IoT in hospitals. The proposed model can work as a system capable of clinical decision and support by offering timely, correct disease diagnosis and suggesting the effective treatment as well. Majorly, the final module developed can bring down the quantity of work of doctors and also improve the rate at which patients get cured.",2021 IEEE Bombay Section Signature Conference (IBSSC),2021.0,1,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IBSSC53889.2021.9673340?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IBSSC53889.2021.9673340, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d9fcd9847165192a97f31b0453d990a06f9b022c,Cardiac arrhythmia detection using photoplethysmography,"Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) cause a very large number of casualties around the world every year and cardiac arrhythmias contribute to significant proportion of CVD related deaths. Bedside cardiac activity monitors in hospitals are based on electrocardiogram (ECG) processing and are known to produce too many false alarms. Moving beyond bedside care, ECG is not very suitable for use in wearable devices. Photoplethysmography (PPG) on the other hand provides an inexpensive and more wearable device-friendly alternative. This work presents a technique to detect life threatening arrhythmias using only PPG waveforms. PhysioNet Challenge 2015 data is used to detect five types of arrhythmias namely, tachycardia, bradycardia, asystole, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. A novel technique is employed to assign pulse quality index to every PPG pulse and highest quality portion of the signal is used for detection. Results indicate that PPG provides a viable alternative for conventional ECG based detection. An overall true positive rate (TPR) of 93% was achieved with true negative rate (TNR) of 53.78% suggesting that PPG is a viable option for arrhythmia detection.",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2017.0,36,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036775?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036775, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Associative classification is a rule based new approach which integrates association rule mining and classification, if applied on medical data sets, lends them to an easier interpretation. It selects a small set of high quality rules and uses these rules for prediction. Heart disease rates among the major cause of mortality in developing countries and is rapidly becoming so in developing countries like India. India is the second most populous country in the world with an estimated population of over 1 billion. Rapid industrialization and urbanization have resulted in tremendous growth in the economy over the last decade. Concurrently India has also seen an exponential rise in prevalence of Heart disease. It has predicted that CVD will be the most important cause of mortality in India by the year 2015, and A. P is in risk of CVD. Hence a decision support system should be proposed to predict the risk score of a patient, which will help in taking precautionary steps like balanced diet and medication which will in turn increase life time of a patient. Through this paper we propose a lazy associative classification for prediction of heart disease in Andhra Pradesh and present some experimental results which will help physicians to take accurate decisions.","International Mutli-Conference on Automation, Computing, Communication, Control and Compressed Sensing",2013.0,55,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IMAC4S.2013.6526381?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IMAC4S.2013.6526381, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The circular economy (CE) tackles waste issues by maximizing value retention in the economy, for instance, through reuse and recycling. However, the reuse of hard disk drives is hindered by the lack of trust organizations have toward other means of data removal than physically destroying HDDs. Here, an agent-based approach explores how organizations' decisions to adopt other data removal means affect HDDs' circularity. The model applies the theory of planned behavior to model the decisions of HDDs end-users. Results demonstrate that the attitude (which is affected by trust) of end-users toward data-wiping technologies acts as a barrier to reuse. Moreover, social pressure can play a significant role as organizations that adopt CE behaviors can set an example for others.",IEEE Conference on Technologies for Sustainability,2021.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/SusTech51236.2021.9467439?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/SusTech51236.2021.9467439, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To facilitate that, we have created a system which classifies Human Development Index of 186 countries. Using various machine learning algorithms we were able to forecast the Human Development Index of those regions till 2025 which will be updated every year. As south Asian countries are quite similar to Bangladesh in terms of health, economy, education, we have emphasized more on these countries. In the first part, we have tested different time series analysis models, AutoRegressive(AR) model,Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA) model, Weighted Moving Average(WMA) model, and Prophet model for forecasting. The Mean Absolute Percentage Errors(MAPE) were 0.04% for AR, 0.18% for WMA, 0.04% for ARIMA, and 0.32% for Prophet model. In the second part, we have tested K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms to group values of HDI indicators (gross national income, life expectancy, expected years of schooling, mean years of schooling ), where the four labels are ’low’ which indicates countries with lower HDI, ’medium’ denotes countries which are still developing, ’high’ specifies countries which are moderately developed and ’very high’ represents the countries with the highest HDI.

ceb142e694ed06bf3192c786a8134d1d107cc495,Drivers and barriers to the development of freight transportation at the South-West polygon of OAO “Russian railways”,"In the future, until 2025, the volume of traffic to the ports of the Azov-Black Sea Basin (ABSB) will increase to 131 million tons per year, including through the commissioning of new transshipment capacities at the port of Taman. The total size of train traffic on the main cargo-intensive directions of the North Caucasus Railway (NCR) will double by 2030, which requires an increase in the throughput of its sections and the development of the transshipment capacity of ports. With insufficient throughput capacity due to the placement of excess trains with export cargo at railway stations, logistical principles are violated when organizing the approach of trains to the ports of ABSB. In this regard, the transition from regional to polygon technology is being carried out, which ensures timely delivery of payload to port stations. The process of coordinating the passage of trains will be accelerated by the Managing Logistics Center (MLC) of the South-West Polygon (SWP), created on the basis of the logistics center of the port road, NCR, since the MLC of the SWP will work directly with the roads where car flows originate. Algorithms for drawing up a plan for the supply of trains have been developed and measures have been proposed to improve the plan for the formation, which provides for an increase in the share of block trains to 85%, of logistics packages. In parallel, a closed polygon model for managing traction resources of railways (MLC SWP), which is part of a single polygon, has been worked out. This will ensure the transition from improving the internal performance of railways to improving system performance that is important for cargo owners.",PROCEEDINGS OF THE SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE ON RAILWAY TRANSPORT AND ENGINEERING (RTE 2021),2021.0,1,0,"{'url': 'https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0064002', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1063/5.0064002?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0064002, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The study employed a modeling approach of life cycle inventory (LCI) to quantify the embodied CO2 emission of prefabricated and cast-in-situ concrete residential buildings in China. Besides, three provinces were selected to estimate the benefits of mitigating CO2 inherited in the country’s urbanization. Results showed that the embodied CO2 reduction of prefabricated buildings was 50 $\mathrm{k}\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{m}2$ compared to that of cast-in-situ buildings. During the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021 to 2025), the mitigation of CO2 emissions associated with prefabrication instead of cast-in-situ of the selected provinces were about 181 million tons, presenting a significant mitigation potential for reaching China’s 2060 carbon-neutral pledge.","International Conferences on Vision, Image and Signal Processing",2021.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICVISP54630.2021.00034?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVISP54630.2021.00034, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The purposes of these development outlines were basically centralized approaches (motivations from top management), like ""top-down” structure, to develop the infrastructure construction of E-Government. Therefore, the Macao SAR government has appropriated a large budget for these items. However, the progress of the whole E-Government in Macao is not in accordance with the above-planned outlines mentioned, and the overall situation is not satisfactory to the Macau citizen. The public and many members of the executive council have often expressed dissatisfaction with the overall development of the E-Government. This paper analyzes the reasons for the unsatisfactory of E-Government in Macao, and proposes an effective approach, that is from a centralized structure to a decentralized cluster since it is much more suitable for the development trend of electronic technology, and a better chance to the success, not only beneficial to the development of Macao E-Government but also as well as the experiences of developing E-Government in other countries and regions, which may expand the coverage of E-Government, effectively reducing administrative operating costs and improving operating efficiency.",Proceedings of the 2022 6th International Conference on E-Business and Internet,2022.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3572647.3572676?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3572647.3572676, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Big data solutions have become more popular as a result of Hadoop's high scalability, availability, and cluster environment mechanism, which enablesworking in a distributed manner. MapReduce, one of the majorcomponents of Hadoop, can handle unstructured data but demands significant programming skills. Because Apache Pig allows us to analyse data by simply running queries, customers are increasingly turning to this tool owing to high programming skill requirements. In this paper, we analyse the crime rates of India of different states from year 2001 to 2015.

Corn productivity based on data from the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics from 2005 to 2015 is not stable. Therefore this study was conducted to determine the right prediction model to see the level of corn productivity in Indonesia for the coming year, with the hope that the government has a reference to continue to work to improve corn productivity to remain stable in order to meet the needs and minimize corn imports. This study uses data on corn productivity in 2005-2015 sourced from the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics. The algorithm used to determine the prediction model is the Backpropagation artificial neural network. This algorithm is able to predict times series data. Based on this algorithm, the training and testing process is carried out using 5 network architecture models, namely 5-25-1, 5-43-1, 5-76-1, 5-78-1 and 7-128-1. The best architecture obtained from the 5 models is 5-25-1 with 88% accuracy percentage and MSE value 0, 00992433.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2019.0,24,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1339/1/012057', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1742-6596/1339/1/012057?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1339/1/012057, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b42fea2206ede2e1057eb2bded5ce9c735c8402f,Solar Energy Forecasting With Fuzzy Time Series Using High-Order Fuzzy Cognitive Maps,"Various studies indicate that Fuzzy Time Series (FTS) methods can obtain high accuracy in a variety of forecasting applciations. However, weighted FTS methods tend to show superiority in contrast to weightless ones. This study exploits the use of Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) technique to generate the rules in the knowledge base for the FTS forecasting method. The proposed hybrid method, named HFCM-FTS, combines High Order Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (HFCM) and High Order Fuzzy Time Series (HOFTS), where the weight matrices associated with the state transitions are learned via the genetic algorithm from the data. The objective of FCM is to find the weight matrices that model the causal relations among the concepts defined in the Universe of Discourse. As a case study, we consider solar energy forecasting with public data for Brazilian solar stations from the year 2012 to 2015. The proposed HFCM-FTS is compared with HOFTS, Weighted High Order FTS (WHOFTS), and Probabilistic Weighted FTS (PWFTS) methods. The experiments also cover the influence of three modeling elements on the accuracy of the presented model including the number of concepts, activation function, and bias. The results show that the HFCM-FTS is able to achieve the best results with a low number of concepts.",IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems,2020.0,16,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FUZZ48607.2020.9177767?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZ48607.2020.9177767, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c77c8dc4a2257658ad67df0581295da5a2c62140,The Knowledge Work of the Future and the Future of Knowledge Work," Our paper investigates what forms the knowledge work design on a corporate level in the future. The future might be 2025, 2030, or 2035. The methodology includes interviews with researchers working with these issues in Telia and Telenor. These companies make their living from understanding the future of work both on a corporate and societal level. The main finding is that AI and robotics will be more advanced, but management and organizational structure will be the main changes. The work will be done more as distance work and through virtual teams. The management and organization of work through the coronavirus have opened for more work done independent of time and the workplace and in virtual teams. There is also predicted a lack of professionals and all types of employees in the years to come, leading both to compete for talent and increased importance in keeping the employed knowledge workers through internal career pipelines. AI and robotics will not reduce the need for professionals and employees. The steps will be taken towards an integrated digitalization that makes new opportunities for collaboration, communication, and knowledge work. The fundamental knowledge worker will be using more of his working time on significant business issues. The skills needed are technical, information management, knowledge management, project management, collaboration, communication, rhetoric, virtual team, creativity, and green problem-solving skills. There is a corporate need for ethical, cultural, tolerating, and sexual awareness. We may summarize the requirements as creative, sustainable, social, and perception manipulation intelligence. The future knowledge will be complex, and the knowledge worker will handle multiple skills in different situations. The future knowledge work will be dominated by increasingly autonomous workers co-opting automated digital systems to create and capture value. The education might be revamped into a more task-focused education offered through the work-life cycles. The revamping of education will also increase the overall employment, and we will not experience the mass unemployment described in the literature as the result of AI, robotics, and digitalization. We have identified that the literature uses the unit occupation and not the unit tasks for the predicted higher unemployment and gets the misinterpretation of negative consequences. The environmental issues and the climate crisis will be taken very seriously in the years to come. There will be cooperation between the political and corporate economies to do whatever is possible for sustainability in all internal and external processes to work greener and smarter. We will experience sustainability in action driven by a green leadership through a green strategy and green business models giving green services and products, reusing as much as possible, and using as few as possible resources to reduce the CO2 gases. This study concludes that there will be many small positive corporate and societal steps for each year towards 2030, improving the way of living and working together with environmental improvements.

83a0ff2c825cd7796772c6bc5623ceb1ee56c2b7,Mining Port Congestion Indicators from Big AIS Data,"In this paper, we introduce three maritime Port Congestion Indicators (PCIs) mined using Automatic Identification System (AIS) static and dynamic messages. The proposed indicators are spatial complexity, spatial density, and time criticality. To calculate the PCIs, we proposed three Big AIS Data mining algorithms to find the geohash area for certain precision, the convex hull area, and the average vessels proximity within the Port Area of Interest (AOI) and in the Period of Interest (POI). The indicators are calculated for the year of 2015 for three ports (Halifax, Hong Kong, and Singapore). The proposed PCIs capture the spatial complexity, spatial density, and time of service criticality. These indicators can be used by port authorities and other maritime stakeholders to alert for congestion levels that can be correlated to weather, high demand, or a sudden collapse in capacity due to strike, sabotage, or other disruptive events. We clustered the indicators for each port into three colour-coded (Green, Yellow, and Red) clusters corresponding to low, medium and high congestion levels. The centroids of these clusters can be used to predict future congestion levels of the port under consideration. To the best of our knowledge in published literature, this work is the first to introduce the application of AIS Big Data analytics to evaluate maritime port congestion levels.",IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network,2018.0,24,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489187?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489187, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

One of the main challenges of the project is to close the gap between effective user experiences of Cultural Heritage via digital tools and representations, and the enrichment of the scientific knowledge. Within this framework, the INCEPTION project goals are consistently aligned while accomplishing the main objectives of accessing, understanding and strengthening European cultural heritage by means of enriched 3D models. At the end of the third year of activity, the project is now facing different challenging actions starting from already developed advancement in 3D data capturing and holistic digital documentation, under interdisciplinary and cross-cutting fields of knowledge. In this direction, the approach and the methodology for semantic organization and data management toward H-BIM modelling will be presented, as well as a preliminary nomenclature for semantic enrichment of heritage 3D models. According to the overall INCEPTION workflow, the H-BIM modelling procedure starts with documenting user needs, including experts and non-experts. The identification of the Cultural Heritage buildings semantic ontology and data structure for information catalogue will allow the integration of semantic attributes with hierarchically and mutually aggregated 3D digital geometric models for management of heritage information.",IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2018.0,28,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/364/1/012089', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1757-899X/364/1/012089?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/364/1/012089, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a910fb95477f09b191af20a3e5ccb4a17873dffe,E-learning in Higher Education to Achieve SDG 4: Benefits and Challenges,"By the year 2030, the world countries have committed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). According to the Incheon Declaration and SDG 4 – Education 2030 Framework for Action (2015), the ""Quality Education"" goal: SDG 4, is proposed to ""ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all"". E-learning, as a flexible learning pathway, enables the inclusion of diverse learners and improves the concept of lifelong learning. Recently, e-learning is becoming a critical strategy that increases the access opportunities for all people to higher education. Several research studies have been done on the benefits of e-learning in higher education, while others have reported many challenges affecting its successful and effective utilization, mostly related to quality assurance. Having the reported benefits, e-learning can be considered as an opportunity to achieve the sustainability of education, given the current huge shift to digital education due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, higher education institutions need to ensure its effective utilization with proper quality assurance processes. A review of scientific papers has been conducted to serve the goal of this study paper. This study is of significance because it highlights the benefits and challenges of e-learning in the developing countries’ higher education as well as presents examples of e-learning quality assurance models developed and implemented internationally, as solutions to overcome the challenges, all in one place which gives a holistic view of the topic. Recommendations have been given to higher education institutions based on the collected results.",2020 Second International Sustainability and Resilience Conference: Technology and Innovation in Building Designs(51154),2020.0,12,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IEEECONF51154.2020.9319981?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEECONF51154.2020.9319981, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6c5cdcaf5100b89d599fda33ce1b5880b9b9734d,Whole-system Benefits of Vehicle-to-Grid Services from Electric Vehicle Fleets,"This paper proposes a whole-system optimisation framework to assess the economic and environmental implications of supplying electricity to electric vehicle (EV) fleets across different charging scenarios, including unmanaged, smart and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) charging. Case studies carried out for the 2025 and 2030 UK power system scenarios suggest that the incremental cost of supplying fleet EVs can be reduced several times if vehicles follow a smart rather than an unmanaged charging regime. Implementing V2G solutions can deliver both net cost savings to the system as well as a reduction in system carbon emissions due to reduced requirements for electricity infrastructure capacity, improved integration of renewable energy and more efficient provision of frequency regulation services. Cost savings and carbon emission reduction per vehicle in the V2G case can reach up to £885 per EV per year and 243 gCO2 per km, respectively, with the greatest benefits observed in scenarios with high renewable penetration and low uptake of other flexible options.",International Conference on Ecological Vehicles and Renewable Energies,2020.0,5,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EVER48776.2020.9243032?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EVER48776.2020.9243032, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Focusing on STEM skills development at secondary education level, a female Computer Science teacher at the 7th public Junior High school of Athens Greece, founded the voluntary Coding Club “GreekCodersK12”. This K-12 education initiative ran for 4 years (2015-2019), formed a learning community based on creativity, innovation and digital skills enhancement and collaborated with researchers, professionals, scientists who contributed voluntarily in the Club’s projects. This paper presents the experiences gained and the lessons learned during this four-year period and throws light on the role of a potential Coding Club founder. The results of this learning path, indicate that a Coding Club is an inclusive after-school programme that can function as an umbrella for innovative activities like programming, educational robotics, STEM, STEAM and ESTEAM (Entrepreneurship – Science – Technology – Engineering – Art – Mathematics).",IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference,2021.0,6,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9454039?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9454039, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

72ec8d69f04962e8fb5052de75f81cab05127359,Using interactive scribe-presentations when teaching Ukrainian,"The article is devoted to the urgent topic of using new modern information technologies in lessons in general and in the Ukrainian language lessons in particular. The authors of the article prove that multimedia presentations have become one of the most popular ways of visual accompaniment in the presentation of theoretical material. In the article the authors analyze the results of the external independent evaluation (EIE) of the Ukrainian language and literature from 2015 to 2018 as well as online testing results of students from the Australian, Canadian and Polish diasporas on the level of Ukrainian language proficiency. According to this analysis it is determined that the level of knowledge on this subject deteriorates every year. Relying on these statistics, scientists have proved the need to improve the quality of knowledge using multimedia presentations, which provide more effective perception of educational information by helping students to visualize it. The researchers have proved the effectiveness of using the PowToon service in teaching philological disciplines in the educational process. This article is a practical step-by-step assistant for teachers and academic staff in creating a scribe-presentation. The authors have analyzed in detail the peculiarities of the methodological approaches that are worth using for effective implementation of PowToon and PowerPoint in the educational process (competence (the ability to actualize available knowledge, skills, experience to solve the difficult tasks in professional activities), systemic (forms the relationship in the study of philology disciplines, systematizes and structures complex information, using them in teaching), informative (use of information and communication technologies in the study of philology disciplines). The effectiveness of using online (PowToon) and offline (PowerPoint) services to create multimedia presentations has been compared. The key stages of the scribe and the advantages of the scribe-presentation have been considered. Taking into account that information is absorbed and reproduced better when it is visualized, that is, through visual perception, therefore, it is proved that use of PowToon service is accompanied by positive emotions and high indicators in the students’ learning outcomes. It is confirmed by a reflection questionnaire at the end of the lesson. The questionnaire consists of five questions and is evaluated on a 10-point scale. After analyzing the responses to the questionnaire the authors have come to the conclusion that the use of the script-presentations has a better influence on the perception of new visual information; increases the motivation for learning, interest in a subject that prompts subjects of the educational process to develop their creative projects and use their knowledge in everyday life; saves teachers’ time while preparing for a lesson; inspires teachers and academic staff to give unusual lessons and provide new interesting teaching ideas, as well as create integrated lessons.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2021.0,6,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1840/1/012044', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1742-6596/1840/1/012044?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1840/1/012044, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7a9521385acdd5e9faa91d542010686388774bd5,FPGA-based Edge Inferencing for Fall Detection,"In the geriatric population, physical injuries sustained by an unintentional or an unpredictable fall on a hard surface is the leading cause of injury related morbidity and sometimes mortality. Each year, close to 30% of adults around the age group of 65 fall down at least once. In the year 2015, close to 2.9 million falls were reported, resulting in 33,000 deaths. As much as 61% of elderly nursing home residents fell at some point during their first year of residence. These falls may aggravate the situation leading to bone fracture, concussion, internal bleeding or traumatic brain injury when immediate medical attention is not offered to the person. Delay in course of the event may sometimes lead to death as well. Recently, many studies have come up with wearable devices. These devices that are now commercially available in the market are small, compact, wireless, battery operated and power efficient. This study discusses the findings that the optimal location for a Fall Detection Sensor on the human body is in front of the Shin bone. This is based on the 183 features collected from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors placed on 16 human body locations and trained-tested using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) machine learning paradigm. The ultimate goal is to develop a mobile, wireless, wearable, low-power medical device that uses a small Lattice iCE40 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) integrated with gyro and accelerometer sensors which detects whether the device wearer has fallen or not. This FPGA is capable of realizing the Neural Network model implemented in it. This Insitu or Edge inferencing wearable device is capable of providing real-time classifications without any Transmitting or Receiving capabilities over a wireless communication channel.",IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference,2020.0,4,0,"{'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9908270', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/GHTC46280.2020.9342948?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/GHTC46280.2020.9342948, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Electric vehicles (EVs) as well as renewable energy have an important role to play. Both, electric vehicles, and renewable energy resources are deeply involved in the Integration of Sustainable Energy Strategy year 2035 (ISES2035), which was released in 2015 by the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable. Introducing electricity to transportation has been developed to support CO2 decrease and energy effectiveness. Consequently, electric vehicles have become more popular in the current transportation system to utilize more effective and environment-friendly energy. The energy sectors integration concept aims to use the renewable energy sources in transportation as well as in power generation. In this research a comprehensive study was made to compare the techno-economic effectiveness of centralized DC fast charging schemes, with decentralized (indoor/overnight) AC charging schemes.

f1150afd8d7624af8863881e6ee39a0262c875d3,Brain Tumor Segmention Based on Dilated Convolution Refine Networks,"A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the tissues of the brain, which is difficult for treatment and severely affects patients' cognitive ability. Recent year magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used imaging technique to assess brain tumors. However manual segmentation and artificial extracting features block MRI's practice when facing with the huge amount of data produced by MRI. An efficient and automatic image segmentation of brain tumor is still needed. In this paper, a novel automatic segmentation framework of brain tumors, which have 5 parts and resnet-50 use as a backbone, is proposed based on convolutional neural network. A dilated convolution refine (DCR) structure is introduced to extract the local features and global features. After investigating different parameters of our framework, it is proved that DCR is an efficient and robust method in Brain Tumor Segmentation. The experiments are evaluated by Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BRATS 2015) dataset. The results show that our framework in complete tumor segmentation achieved excellent results with a DEC score of 0.87 and a PPV score of 0.92.

Since the time series data taken is not integrated in of the same order, the Toda-Yamamoto methodology was applied to test for causality. The results show that 29 companies out 50 companies have two-way (bi-directional) causality between price and volume and 15 companies have one way (unidirectional) causal relationship where price causes volume and volume does not cause price and 6 other companies have no causal relationship in either way.

The threats are getting stronger year by year. In 2015, the National Institute of Technology (KOSEN) launched the KOSEN Security Educational Community (K-SEC) and started cyber security training for KOSEN students. This project has two main purposes that one is outstanding cyber security human resource development which objects for improving quality and other one is fostering many KOSEN students who have systematically acquired security knowledge which objects for quantitative expansion. As part of K-SEC, research of cyber security human resource development education has been promoted. A new project ”Highly Advanced Cybersecurity for KOSEN (HACK) ” has been launched within K-SEC to accelerate the achievement of the two main purposes since 2019. HACK is a project based on the simple idea of strengthening KOSEN technical staff in order to foster strong students who have acquired practical cyber security skills. The plan is a three-year plan. HACK has three main objectives which are improving faculties ’ and technical staffs’ skills, the development excellent teaching materials based on the skills and to create both skills and human resources network. The success of HACK is important to contribute not only to security education but also to the examination of KOSEN or engineering education centered on practical education. In this paper, we will evaluate the effectiveness and legal theory of cyber security practice education for faculty and technical staff who participate the IT course in the first year. In addition, we will verify the effect of improving the skills of each faculty member in the off-season until the start of the second year. Furthermore, we will also consider whether the cyber security skills of the entire technical college have improved in the fiscal year. This year, we are proceeding with the project for the second year. In the second year, based on the results of the first year, we will evaluate, consider and examine for the improvement of the educational content toward the third year, which is the completion year. The evaluation includes the validity of the schedule. We also achieved a certain level of success in the development of teaching materials. This project is in good condition for the continuation of the plan and consideration of new items for the next year and after next year. In this paper, we report on the process of building this sustainable and effective cybersecurity education methodology suitable for KOSEN faculty and staff, and thus for students.",IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference,2021.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453958?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453958, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

818f6e6aa588b49ae1e096c6924c49a2ee9e2e76,MOTA: engineering an operator agnostic mobile service,"There are two emerging trends in the mobile data world. First, mobile data is exploding at a rapid rate with analysts predicting 25-50X growth by the year 2015. The second trend is that users are demanding greater degree of flexibility in selecting their operators at fine timescales. Across Asia, dual-SIM phones have become popular, while Apple is rumored to be designing a Universal SIM that will allow iPhone users to toggle between different operators. This latter trend points towards an impending disruption in wireless service models which could also be the need of the hour from the spectrum shortage perspective. This points towards a new service model where users can choose an operator based on application needs. However, if users make this choice greedily without network assistance, it can exacerbate spectrum scarcity and degrade user experience. In this work, we consider user devices with multiple network interfaces (3G, LTE etc.) that can be simultaneously active and each running multiple applications. We propose the MOTA service model to enable users to associate each interface with the operator of choice at fine time scales. Under the MOTA service model, through concise signalling information, operators provide information about their own network, so that each user can (i) choose a suitable operator for each interface, and (ii) choose an interface for each active application. We make the following contributions in this paper. First, we propose concise network signalling that assists users to make informed choices even under mobility. Second, we develop user-choice algorithms that maximize a suitable notion of user satisfaction while using spectrum resources efficiently. Third, we perform extensive evaluation over actual base station deployment in a city coupled with real signal propagation maps. Our results with two operators show that, MOTA service model provides capacity gain in the range 2.5-4X over the current existing service model. Finally, we argue that our solution is practically implementable by combining appropriate IEEE standards and IETF proposals.",ACM/IEEE International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking,2011.0,53,9,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/2030613.2030629?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/2030613.2030629, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Because student graduation there are standards that must be Achieved by the Study Program items, namely a four-year study period and a 3.0 GPA. Therefore we need a prediction that can Anticipate from the beginning of the graduation standard level that has been set. This study aims to predict student graduation using Naïve Bayes Classifier with a data mining approach. Naïve Bayes provides accurate prediction results with a minimum error rated compared to all other data mining components. With the prediction of the student, graduation can be used as input, especially the Information System Study Program in making policies for improvement in the future. The software used in data processing is WEKA.

It was also analysed which indicator that is dominant based on its resulted weight. The process was conducted by using perceptron method, while the data was taken from students of Department of Mathematics, IPB University, enrolled in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Furthermore, the results showed that learning proses accuracy stand at 80.5 % and all mentioned indicators give a positive contribution to students in pursuing on-time graduation except supervised by the lecturer whose field of interest is in line with the student. Additionally, based on the resulted weight for each indicator, student’s GPA has a bigger impact for student to graduate on time.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2021.0,3,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1796/1/012060', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1742-6596/1796/1/012060?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1796/1/012060, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The data used is secondary data using the literature method, namely by studying and reading literature related to the problems that are the object of research, such as books, articles, journals, surveys, news and other documents. The results of the study reveal that the number of Android users in Indonesia is quite high and increasing every year, such as in 2015-2018 an increase of 27%, so it will be effective if used as a learning medium. In addition, this pandemic condition causes the need for the use of Android-based Learning Media to be quite significant. In contrast to the ability of educators in mastery of technology, there are only 40% of educators who are ready for technology because for media creation at this time sufficient technological capabilities are needed, so the use of Android-Based Learning Media is quite low, especially those using Android applications based on Adobe Flash CS6. Where it is necessary to have regular training so that the competence of Educators is in accordance with the demands and conditions of the times. Especially with the current condition of the Covid-19 Pandemic, the ability of teachers in technology is needed to support the learning process. so that the use of Android-Based Learning Media is quite low, especially those that use Android applications based on Adobe Flash CS6.

b417708958bafa92dfce6b349252e88e3fc84922,An Analysis on the Effect of E-Banking on Bank Performance in Indonesia,"This research aims to analyze the impact of e-banking on Indonesian bank performance. E-banking indicators used in this research consist of internet banking, mobile banking, and ATM. Bank performance is measured by ROA, ROE, and NIM. Three control variables, namely bank size, efficiency, and CAR, are also included in the study. The research sample consists of 36 banks listed in IDX, with a five-year observation period (from 2015-2019). This research employs multiple regression analysis. The findings suggest that internet banking has a positive significant effect on bank performance, while ATM is positive but not significant when control variables are considered. Contrary to prediction, mobile banking’s impact on bank performance is negative, with non-significant to weak significant impact. In Indonesia, it appears that bank performance is still dominated by more traditional measures, such as bank size and CAR, rather than e-banking. Nevertheless, given the technological advancement nowadays, it is possible to see the greater effect of e-banking on Indonesian bank performance in the future.",International Conference on Information Management and Technology,2021.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICIMTech53080.2021.9535039?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIMTech53080.2021.9535039, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ae4fa9cc8201fbf2a1527133080c95fba842e48c,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"Since its inauguration in 2006 in Taipei, ASIACCS, the ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security, has become an integral part of scientific community in the field of security and privacy. It has been held in Singapore (2007), Tokyo (2008), Sydney (2009), Beijing (2010), Hong Kong (2011), Seoul (2012), Hangzhou (2013), Kyoto (2014), Singapore (2015), and Xi'an (2016). 
 
ASIACCS 2017 takes place in Abu Dhabi and is organized by the New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE. We received 359 submissions, a new record in the conference's decade-long history. This year's Program Committee comprising 108 security researchers from 26 countries, evaluated submissions through a rigorous review procedure. For the first time in the conference's history, a Shadow Program Committee (SPC), composed of 27 security researchers from 14 countries, was introduced. The task of the SPC members was to comment on the reviews made by the PC members, in addition to reviewing the corresponding papers. On the one hand, the SPC comments greatly helped to significantly enhance the quality the many reviews. On the other hand, to provide the anonymity for SPC members, they could not directly debate with the PC members, which was largely due to technological limitations: HotCRP (or any review software for that matter) is not designed to have some accounts only seeing some information. We had a discussion of doubleblind vs. single-blind requirements. One of our main goals when designing the system was to ensure that junior reviewers in the SPC could raise criticism of senior reviewers with impunity. Despite the management effort, we believe that implementing the SPC concept was successful. We also learned useful lessons on how to improve it. 
 
After the review process concluded, 67 full papers were accepted to be presented at the conference, representing an acceptance rate of about 18%. In addition, 4 short papers and 10 posters/demos were also included in the program. 
 
We have a strong technical program along with 5 specialized pre-conference workshops, three tutorials and an invited talk track that is introduced this year. 
 
The pre-conference workshops are 4th ACM ASIA Public-Key Cryptography Workshop (APKC 2017), ACM Workshop on Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (BCC'17), 3rd ACM Cyber-Physical System Security Workshop (CPSS 2017), 3rd International Workshop on IoT Privacy, Trust, and Security (IoTPTS 2017), 4th International Workshop on Security in Cloud Computing (SCC). 
 
We are fortunate to have distinguished keynote and invited speakers as well as tutorial lecturers who will present insights into current and future security and privacy research trends. There are three keynotes: Ross Anderson (University of Cambridge, UK), Christof Paar (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany), and Gregory Neal Akers (Senior Vice President, Cisco Systems). Additionally, there are six invited talks by Mustaque Ahamad (Georgia Institute of Technology, US), Srdjan Capkun (ETH, Switzerland), Ivan Martinovic (Oxford University, UK), David Naccache (ENS, France), Matthias Payer (Purdue, US) and Gene Tsudik (UC Irvine, US). Finally, the conference features three tutorial lectures given by N. Asokan and Andrew Paverd (Aalto University, Finland), Johannes Buchmann (TU Darmstadt, Germany), Ghassan Karame (NEC) and Alexandra Dmitrienko (ETH, Switzerland).",ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2017.0,16,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3052973?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3052973, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The integration of renewable energy sources such as wind and photovoltaic into the existing grid is rapidly increasing. These global trends are expected to continue into the foreseeable future and could have a detrimental effect on grid performance. Problems in the grid will arise such as, reducing system inertia and reducing reactive power capacity. In many cases, these grid issues can be addressed with ancillary services. Presently in Indonesia, the necessity of reactive power and inertia were provide from conventional power plants by the state-owned company, PLN. The simulation in this paper will show the requirement of reactive power and system inertia from the synchronous condenser as ancillary services. The simulation is conducted on the Jawa-Madura-Bali System model, which is the most extensive system in the Indonesian power grid. The total capacity of photovoltaic and wind in the year 2025 is 1,430 MW, and the capacity of synchronous condensers as ancillary services is 2,152 MW in scattered locations. Synchronous condensers shift to a better voltage, and system stiffness will increase from 680 MW to 794 MW.",International Conferences on Information Technologies and Electrical Engineering,2020.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICITEE49829.2020.9271782?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITEE49829.2020.9271782, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b4d61bf7a5ff190b6a9ac65957e587ff5550c49b,Random Forest Modeling for Survival Analysis of Cancer Recurrences,"The recurrence of breast cancer is a prevailing problem that decreases the quality of patients’ lives, creates high burdens on the healthcare system, and impacts the wellbeing of society. Advanced sensing provides an unprecedented opportunity to increase information visibility and characterize patterns of event occurrences. However, few, if any, of previous works have investigated survival analysis of breast cancer recurrences based on large amount of data readily available in the health system. There is a dire need to leverage data to decipher important factors that play a role in the recurrence of breast cancer. This paper presents an ensemble method of random survival forest for time-to-event analysis of breast cancer recurrences in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) data from year 1973 to 2015. Our model characterizes the survival function among patients with and without recurrences of breast cancer. Ensemble models are constructed via sampling and bootstrapping into the big data. Experimental results show that the age when cancer recurrence happens and time-between-recurrences approximately follow the Gaussian and exponential distributions with the means of $61.35 \pm 14.03$ and 2.61 years, respectively. In addition, the results show age, surgery status, stage of tumors, and histological grade are significant factors that influence the probability of breast cancer recurrences. The proposed survival analysis approach shows strong potentials to help healthcare practitioners in prognosis, treatment, and decision-making of breast cancer recurrences.",2019 IEEE 15th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE),2019.0,10,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/COASE.2019.8843271?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2019.8843271, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f4af98d86d4ec0693b0d345eb9e7c462adb25022,Assessment of Learning Outcomes in the (Java) Object-Oriented Programming Courses,"The aim of this paper is to obtain students' review on the possible difficulties and workload when mastering the prescribed learning outcomes in object-oriented programming courses based on the JAVA™ programming language. The results of this measurement provide a basis for a possible revision of scheduled hourly rate and consequently ECTS points required for students to achieve the prescribed learning outcomes regarding ESG 2015 guidelines for QA. Perennial experience in teaching indicate that object-oriented programming courses are one of the most demanding in mastering the subject material at the undergraduate level (6 EQF), which is why authors have conducted a survey as part of the JAVA™ course before the final exam at 4 different higher education institutions in the Republic of Croatia. On a scale from 1 to 5 (5 being the highest), students have assessed the difficulty in achieving each learning outcome and also the subjects/topics taught in the course. The results of the survey were compared with the passing results in the summer exams period (academic year 2021/2022 as an additional variable test of the obtained answers). The authors present the summary of their results and provide the conclusion in the context of the subject and course revision regarding curriculum and subject oriented student workload.",International Conference Innovation Engineering and Technology,2023.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICIET56899.2023.10111296?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIET56899.2023.10111296, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

""At 2025, the losses in fraud around the world could amount to about $44 billion, according to McKinsey."" Every year, trillions of dollars are lost from fraudulent card transactions. An efficient fraud detection system based on advanced machine learning techniques have gained excellent value in all Financial Institutions to reduce these losses. The proposed algorithm SLREnsemble (Stochastic Latent Representation Ensemble) is a hybrid model that uses deep neural network Autoencoders to obtain the latent representation of genuine and fraudulent transactions and these representations are given as an input to the balanced ensemble model. The technique is tested against other existing methods, i.e., Isolation Forest, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms, by various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

4229f1a6b0207f5acb7bac5ecc999c5550f8802c,ASSETS: Fostering a community of engineering transfer students - best practices and beyond,"This Research-to-Practice full paper presents findings from the ASSETS program - a comprehensive support ecosystem developed to improve retention and reduce time to graduation for engineering transfer students. ASSETS builds on the momentum established by two statewide initiatives in Tennessee that place transfer students at the forefront: (1) Tennessee Promise - a nationally recognized scholarship program launched in 2015 that provides last-dollar scholarships for low-income students to attend any state community college, and (2) Tennessee Reconnect - a last-dollar grant established in 2018 that allows adults who do not have an associate degree to attend a community or technical college tuition-free. With over 100,000 students enrolled in these programs to date, the number of students transferring to four-year institutions is expected to increase exponentially in the coming years. Historically, transfer students have been at higher risk of attrition due to known academic and social barriers. This is especially true for the Engineering disciplines. In an effort to address these obstacles, we have developed the Academic Intervention, Social Supports, and Scholarships for Engineering Transfer Students (ASSETS) program. In its third year of operation, with 35 enrolled ASSETS scholars, the program is well underway. Among our findings, we have recognized the critical importance of nurturing a community of transfer students that emphasizes equity, diversity, and inclusion. Establishing such a community involves more than just adopting established best practices. It requires a shift in mindset on behalf of the student regarding what is required to succeed, as well as on the part of faculty on what is expected of incoming students. This paper presents the findings and outcomes of the ASSETS program towards providing support to and enhancing the success of engineering transfer students.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2021.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637412?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637412, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a critical infrastructure device used for aircraft surveillance on air traffic flow. Aircraft information data transmitted by aircraft ADS-B transmitter is captured by ADS-B ground station receiver via radio frequency 978 – 1090 MHz. Information data received in form of position, altitude, speed, Mode-S address, direction, callsign, and other information can assist air traffic controllers in improving the safety and capacity of Indonesian airspace. However, with the vast territory of Indonesia in the form of an archipelago, the existing and owned ADS-B equipment has not been able to cover the entire territory of Indonesia. Therefore, we decided to research by building an ADS-B mobile ground station receiver architecture that can be moved and implemented easily portable using Raspberry PI and RTL-SDR to keep an eye on and take over the airspace control on the unreached territory with hybrid connectivity that can use radio frequencies only or with the internet.",International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science Technology,2021.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICAICST53116.2021.9497826?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAICST53116.2021.9497826, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The subject teacher proposed an “insertion” in the actual instructions following DepEd Order No. 8, s. 2015 through the development and application of Game Estrategia. The group who received an “insertion” revealed that the overall computed t value was -16.48, which was greater than the t critical value 1.68 one-tailed and 2.02 two-tailed at 0.05 level of significance, which means a significant difference between pretest and posttest in the Applied Subject. The study found out that the group performed very well in their posttest after giving them an “insertion.” Insistent with the Agency’s effort to deliver quality education, the concept of “insertion” through technology aid may improve the teaching-learning process for the identified learning competencies (LCs) in the Curriculum Guide of Secondary Public Schools. The study humbly recommended joint advocacies of the School Administrators, the Subject Teachers, and the Technical Working Group (TWG) to develop, enhance, and sustain Game Estrategia’s objectives in Basic Education. Aside from the modules regularly provided by the Secondary Public Schools, teachers can tap the promising benefits of today’s technology as alternatives to attain successful learning every day.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2021.0,2,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1860/1/012021', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1742-6596/1860/1/012021?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1860/1/012021, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is noted that the number of IKM in the country has increased every year. In 2015 there were 3.68 million IKM and increased to 4.41 million IKM. In 2017, the number of IKM reached 4.59 million. The SME workforce absorption has the largest proportion compared to other sectors. The percentage of labour absorption in 2016 reached 97.22 percent. In 2016, IKM in Indonesia increased by 4.5 percent, growing to 165,983 units compared to 2015 and has absorbed a workforce of 350,000 people. Data from Diskoperindag of Bondowoso Regency states that every year the number of IKMs increases by at least 5 percent, until now the number of IKM in Bondowoso has reached more than 36 thousand, an increase compared to 2013 which reached 28 thousand IKM. In order to improve and optimize the IKM in Bondowoso Regency, a system was developed that is able to assist existing IKM and new IKM that will emerge, thus providing an overview of the distribution of IKM throughout Bondowoso Regency. The IKM Geographical Information System developed is able to visualize the distribution of IKM in Bondowoso Regency well. The system has been successfully developed through testing, namely the proportion of test results of 100%, where the average value of system quality (5.6), information quality (5.4) and user satisfaction (5.35).",IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environment,2021.0,2,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/672/1/012083', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1755-1315/672/1/012083?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/672/1/012083, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

97d0de1c1852e78aec8c92a87d72775748a157f1,The impact of placement in introductory computer science courses on student persistence in a computing major,"Multiple studies have shown that when novice and experienced programmers are enrolled in the same introductory programming course, the novice programmers are negatively impacted. We have two entry points into our course sequence for majors. One course is intended for students with little or no programming experience, while the alternate course is intended for students who have had previous programming experience. In 2015 we discovered that many students with programming experience were enrolling in the course for novice programmers. A change in our placement strategy in 2016 resulted in a greater portion of the students with programming experience actually enrolled in the course intended for students with programming experience. Last year we reported on the impact this change had on the courses and the students enrolled in these introductory courses. Although student performance improved only slightly, many fewer students with little or no previous programming experience reported that their first programming course was unreasonably difficult in 2016. In this paper we examine how this change in placement strategy and resulting changes in the courses is impacting student persistence in the major. Initial indications are that a greater percentage of students with little or no previous programming experience are persisting in their computing major when these students begin in an introductory course that does not also include students who have substantial programming experience.",Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,2018.0,13,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3197091.3197139?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3197091.3197139, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a48ea3d487a63c2553248e88bf532030dfef1e99,CS4All: An Early Look at Teacher Implementation in NYC,"CS for All initiatives have emerged around the country in the last decade with the hopes of addressing the growing call for all students to have opportunities to be proficient computational thinkers and to be exposed to computer science (CS) curriculum throughout their educational careers. As districts and states grapple with the realities of implementing such initiatives, they must address a key barrier: a lack of teacher capacity to teach CS. NYC's Computer Science for All (CS4All) is a 10-year, districtwide initiative aimed at providing high-quality computer science (CS) education to all public-school students. To address teacher capacity issues, the district has designed and implemented professional development (PD) with the goal of providing high-quality training to nearly 5,000 teachers by 2025. We conducted online surveys with about 1,500 teachers who participated in the multi-day professional development to assess the early outcomes of this effort. Results from two years of surveys offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, ability of teachers to implement CS in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering CS (even in a district where CS is a priority). They also provide insight into how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs compared to schools serving students with lower economic needs. The successes and challenges highlighted by these data inform the work of other districts and states around the country engaged in similar efforts.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2020.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3328778.3372627?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3372627, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The dataset consists of 560 instances and 59 features. We considered the state as the response variable and 35 features as predictors after self-reduction. The dataset is trained and tested with k-fold cross validation using three popular supervised machine learning classifiers named Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) and random forest (RF) in the Weka 3.8.1 workbench. The outcomes of the study reveal that RF classifier outperformed with highest accuracy (83.39%) the ANN and SMO at 6-Fold of Cross-Validation (CV).

Aiming at the accuracy of time series remote sensing data generated by spatiotemporal fusion model, this paper proposes a time series assessment method based on Dynamic time warping (DTW), which uses GF-2 and Landsat-8 data to product 2015 year time series data by selected four typical spatiotemporal fusion models (STARFM, FSDAF, ESPFM, Single-pair SPSTFM), and compare synthesized data with reference data. The results show that the time series assessment method has a high consistency with the existing methods which based on spatial quality evaluation. And this method can be used as an effective method to evaluate the accuracy of synthesized time series data.",2020 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications (ICAICA),2020.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICAICA50127.2020.9182494?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAICA50127.2020.9182494, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Having a high affecting rate, it increases the significance of initial diagnosis. Diabetes brings other complicated complications like cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, stroke, damaging the vital organs etc. Early diagnosis of diabetes reduces the likelihood of transiting it into a chronic and severe state. The identification and analysis of risk factors of different spinal attributes help to identify the prevalence of diabetes in medical diagnosis. The prevalence measure and identification of diabetes in the early stages reduce the chances of future complications. In this research, the collective NHANES dataset of 1999-2000 to 2015-2016 was used and the purposes of this research were to analyze and ascertain the potential risk factors correlated with diabetes by using Logistic Regression, ANOVA and also to identify the abnormalities by using multiple supervised machine learning algorithms. Class imbalance, outlier problems were handled and experimental results show that age, blood-related diabetes, cholesterol and BMI are the most significant risk factors that associated with diabetes.

ef6a6eb121cf2723035f86362f2b8521496d424b,Impact of Electric Vehicle Charging Control on the Frequency Response: Study of the GB System,"The growth of vehicle electrification is driven by the desire to reduce environmental pollution, and it is fueled by advancements in battery technology. If left unmanaged, electric vehicle (EV) charging will increase peak demand and put a strain on the electricity networks. However, if properly managed, EVs can provide useful services to the power system operator such as fast active-power injection which serves to improve the system frequency response (SFR) after a disturbance. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact that clusters of EVs, connected to frequency-responsive charging stations, have on the provision of SFR after a loss of generation event. The assessment considers EV charging demand in Great Britain (GB) for the year 2025 considering three different daily charging patterns. A generic model for the EV clusters is developed which includes the effects of measurement delays and control charger time response. The model and scenarios are integrated into a single-area model representative of the GB power system and the minimum expected values for the system's inertia in the year 2025 are used. The results obtained highlight the benefits on the SFR of utilizing EVs as a dynamic energy storage system for different types of charging and the impact of the measurement delay on the dynamics of the response.",IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe,2018.0,5,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ISGTEurope.2018.8571429?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGTEurope.2018.8571429, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

105dd95fe798bd37701470d5357c360866860376,Deep Learning for IoT Communications : Invited Presentation,"In recent years there has been a rapid evolution in research in the technology known as the Internet of Things or IoT. Consequently, this development has caused an increase in connected devices. According to Statista, the amount of IoT connected devices by the year 2025 will be 75.44 billion. Given this expected exponential rise in connected devices, this will cause an increase in the transmitted data by the year 2025 as well. The Data Management Solutions Review states that data creation will reach 163 zettabytes by 2025. These conditions will cause an escalation in data transmission which will cause problems such as latency, data rates, congestion, nonlinearities, and other complexities. While communication systems have performed well based on traditional mathematical transforms, there is a need to present new solutions to mitigate these problems. One potential solution is to resort to advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques to help manage the rise in data volumes and algorithm-driven applications. The recent success of Deep Learning (DL) underpins new and powerful tools that tackle problems in this space. The unique parameters of DL techniques are capable of properly characterizing and categorizing complex signals being transmitted and received. This paper will investigate the optimization of communication systems at the physical layer (PHY) with future applications in IoT hardware implementation using a 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).",Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems,2019.0,4,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CISS.2019.8693025?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2019.8693025, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f9cbe8c17916807c4b2dceedccf645c838b5714a,Building a Statewide Computer Science Teacher Pipeline,"From 2012 to 2015, the number of Utah secondary teachers teaching computer science courses grew from 38 to 164. This growth was made possible by introducing three new CS teacher endorsements, which reduced the effort required for existing teachers to start teaching CS. Instead of committing to completing five college-level CS courses in two years, an existing but new-to-CS Utah teacher could complete an Exploring Computer Science (ECS) endorsement in half a year. Thanks to changes to high school graduation requirements, students were able to take a CS course without using an elective credit, boosting enrollment and broadening participation. Analysis of ECS teacher surveys and student surveys found surprisingly few differences between CS-experienced teachers and new-to-CS teachers in their ability to teach CS. By the end of the ECS course, even ECS students with low confidence in their own CS abilities believed that anyone could succeed in CS, regardless of their teacher's CS background. All students' interest in taking additional CS classes significantly increased after taking ECS, although CS-experienced teachers had a stronger impact on ECS students with low confidence than new-to-CS teachers. These results suggest that school districts seeking to provide computer science education for all their students can successfully staff their CS classes by supporting existing secondary teachers with no prior CS background with quality CS professional development and mentoring.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2017.0,12,0,"{'url': 'http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3017788&type=pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3017680.3017788?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3017680.3017788, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d498ff5be25f93d953bcc027c708088284c5ae78,Endure: Augmented Reality Fitness Mobile Application,"An alarming fact that surprisingly not many locals are aware of is that Malaysia has been labelled as Asia’s fattest country in the year 2015 up until now. With abundance of food comes immense responsibility to take care of our health, however that is not the case for Malaysians. Based on the survey distributed, not many integrate exercising as a part of their weekly routine as they prioritize their work/study over a 20-minute workout session. The repercussions of this unhealthy habit are severe, and may cause a global pandemic of obese-stricken populations in the future. With that being said, ‘Endure’ is an application proposed to aid in mitigating the issue mentioned. It is a fitness application that incorporates a gaming environment enabling the user to be the first-person player in a horror-themed game. Using immersive technology such as Augmented Reality (AR), users are able to play this chapter-by-chapter application whilst outdoors or indoors. Endure encourages users to challenge themselves by increasing the distance for each level while limiting the time required to complete each one of them. With the aid of an AR game object, users will be pushed to keep their virtual-selves alive by increasing their pace with regards to the countdown timer. In short, the application is developed to motivate users to keep their feet moving by creating a virtually fun environment for the players.","International Conference on Communication, Computing & Security",2019.0,4,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CCOMS.2019.8821640?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CCOMS.2019.8821640, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The input data of ANN is comprising with the multiple time lags of hourly data of power, current, temperature, solar irradiance and hour that have been denoised by using the wavelet decomposition. The multiple time lags are used to improve the input data while wavelet decomposition removes the noises available in the data which will then significantly improve the STPPF results. The data of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system in the year 2015 and 2016 obtained from the Green Energy Research (GERC), UiTM, Shah Alam, Malaysia. The results have shown that the ANN provides relatively accurate results of STPPF and able to forecast the PV output power for the next 24 hours with less error.","2019 International Conference on Engineering, Science, and Industrial Applications (ICESI)",2019.0,4,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICESI.2019.8862996?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICESI.2019.8862996, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4773438710022fe61177bcdbf9529e312764a9ae,Data mining approach for predicting student and institution's placement percentage,"Placement of students is one of the very important activities in educational institutions. Admission and reputation of institutions mainly depends on placements. Hence all institutions strive to strengthen placement department. In this study, the objective is to analyze previous year's student's historical data and predict placement chance of the current students and the percentage placement chance of the institution. A model is proposed along with an algorithm to predict the placement chance of students. Data pertaining to the study were collected form the same institution for which the placement chance prediction and percentage placement need to be found from 2006 to 2015. Data collected is divided into historic data form 2016to 1014 and test data i.e, 2014; 2016 data is considered as current data. Suitable data pre-processing methods are applied. Students having better chance of placement are characterized as good if not bad. This proposed model is compared with other classification algorithms such as Naïve bayes, Decision tree, and Neural network with respect to accuracy, precision and recall. From the results obtained it is found that the proposed algorithm predicts better in comparison with other algorithms.",2016 International Conference on Computation System and Information Technology for Sustainable Solutions (CSITSS),2016.0,13,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CSITSS.2016.7779381?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CSITSS.2016.7779381, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Some researchers advocate that sometimes teachers don't use correct methods of assessment and that many students pass in programming without knowing how to program. In this paper authors describe the assessment methodology applied to a first year, first semester, Biomedical Engineering programming course (2015/2016). Students' programming skills were tested by playing a game in the first class, then they were assessed with three tests and a final exam, each with topics the authors considered fundamental for the students to master. A correlation analyses between the different types of tests and exam questions is done, to evaluate the most suitable, for assessing programming knowledge, showing that it is possible to use different question types as a pedagogical strategy, to assess student difficulty levels and programming skills, that help students acquire abstract, reasoning and algorithm thinking in an acceptable level.

In SIGIR 2014 and SIGIR 2015, we have run the privacy-preserving IR workshops exploring and understanding the privacy and security risks in information retrieval. This year, we continue the efforts of connecting the two disciplines of IR and privacy/security by organizing this workshop. We target on three themes, differential privacy and IR dataset release, privacy in search and browsing, and privacy in social media. The workshop includes panels with researchers from both fields on these three themes, as well as invite industry speakers for real-world challenges.

6992af30d7b4c139611a1d3b05685183fcf4dafe,Generating 2.5D Motion Graphics from 2D Designs,"As of the year 2020, the video production industry is worth 31 billion dollars in the United States alone, with more than 6000 businesses and 57000 employees, and keeps growing. The global computer animation market size is anticipated to reach USD 28.30 billion by 2025, according to Grand View Research, Inc. Such significant growth demands the tech industry to introduce better tools for making animations. In this paper, we propose our contribution, specifically for User Interface designers in the field of motion graphics. Ul/UX design is found to be one of the top 5 most trending opportunities for motion designers, and our proposed system allows them to generate a 2.5D animation based on a 2D Futuristic User Interface (FUI) design. The ultimate goal is to reduce the production time of FUI animations and minimize the cost of responding to the client's changes. Obtaining clients' feedback directly on animations rather than still images would improve the client's involvement in production, resulting in greater confidence and loyalty. We implement several image processing techniques such as thinning and pixel clustering for pre-processing the 2D designs to segment the given design into an array of atomic shapes. Since the thinned shapes ensure that any pixel in the design does not have adjacent pixels which are also adjacent to each other, it is possible to utilize mathematical means to approximate the shapes. Our system converts a given 2D design to a collection of animated lines and arcs distributed in 3D space that eventually can be exported to the industry-standard tool, Adobe After Effects.",International Conference on Automation and Computing,2020.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357147?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357147, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Pre and post training surveys from the 2019 summer cohort revealed teachers made statistically significant gains in CS content knowledge, confidence in teaching CS, confidence in learning CS, motivation to learn CS, and knowledge of engaging students in CS. C-START professional development trainings are offered each year based on educator requests, such as Beauty and Joy of Computing, Mobile CSP, Java Programming, Web Programming, Snap!, CS Unplugged, and Introduction to Cryptography. Synergystically, the C-START program has hosted the National CSPdWeek three times featuring Bootstrap and Exploring Computer Science. C-START has had a significant positive impact in Colorado CS high school education. For example, in 2015, a year before C-START began, only 170 high school students in Colorado took the AP CS A exam and only 15.4% of those students were female. In 2018, 791 high school students took the AP CS A exam in Colorado and 20.6% of the exam takers were female. Similar positive outcomes exist for students from other underrepresented groups (e.g., from 7.3% to 21.3% for Hispanic/Latino).

a707093c25f630093ab0d707bd5a7c941485072b,Colorado Strategic Approach to Rally Teachers,"Colorado Strategic Approach to Rally Teachers (C-START) has provided computer science (CS) professional development to 1,425 K-12 teachers from 2016 to the present impacting over 7,000 students (who are ~33% female and 21% from other underrepresented groups). Pre and post training surveys from the 2019 summer cohort revealed teachers made statistically significant gains in CS content knowledge, confidence in teaching CS, confidence in learning CS, motivation to learn CS, and knowledge of engaging students in CS. C-START professional development trainings are offered each year based on educator requests, such as Beauty and Joy of Computing, Mobile CSP, Java Programming, Web Programming, Snap!, CS Unplugged, and Introduction to Cryptography. Synergystically, the C-START program has hosted the National CSPdWeek three times featuring Bootstrap and Exploring Computer Science. C-START has had a significant positive impact in Colorado CS high school education. For example, in 2015, a year before C-START began, only 170 high school students in Colorado took the AP CS A exam and only 15.4% of those students were female. In 2018, 791 high school students took the AP CS A exam in Colorado and 20.6% of the exam takers were female. Similar positive outcomes exist for students from other underrepresented groups (e.g., from 7.3% to 21.3% for Hispanic/Latino). While C-START is not the only PD opportunity for Colorado teachers, we are confident that C-START is helping more Colorado students access CS education.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2021.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3408877.3439636?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3439636, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

49c90df49d5292655662930a87a65e8bac46d5b3,Automated production system simulations using commercial off-the-shelf simulation tools,"A multi-year research project focused on a global aerospace company's design-to-production transition, and in particular how to answer production-related questions much earlier in a program's design cycle than is possible today. A fundamental difficulty is that the time and expertise required to formulate appropriate analysis models prevents their routine use, especially in new program development. The project's goal was to reduce these requirements, and by late 2014 a methodology had been developed for on-demand analysis generation to answer routine questions about production systems. A pilot project was conducted in 2015 to demonstrate efficacy, that an implementation of the methodology could in fact reduce by at least an order of magnitude the time required to answer a frequently-asked question, in a repeatable way while specification of the products, their process plans, planned facilities, and available resources were frequently changing.

Hotspot is parameter that can be used as an indicator for forest fires. One of the data mining techniques that can be used to process hotspot data is clustering. Clustering technique is used to obtain interesting patterns so that analysis on the occurrence of hotspots can be done. This research aims to build a clustering module in SpagoBI framework integrated with R engine. The algorithm used in the clustering is ST-DBSCAN with parameters are spatial distance (Eps1), temporal distance (Eps2), and cluster density (MinPts). This research used hotspot data in Indonesia from January to March 2015. The clustering module displays the result and visualizes hotspots clusters in the form of map and chart on HTML page through R software. Analysis of result shows patterns of hotspots' occurrence that appear most frequently are stationary pattern in Bengkalis in January-March 2015.","International Conference on Information Technology, Computer, and Electrical Engineering",2016.0,12,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICITACEE.2016.7892465?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITACEE.2016.7892465, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c03b9fa881f5ec944f12ee3289b21e67be90a332,Link-level Travel Time Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network Models,"Different types of artificial neural network models were explored by researchers in the past. However, it is not clear from the past literature as to which of these models is best suitable for predicting the travel time of a link. Therefore, the objective of this study is to research and select the best neural network model structure to predict travel time on selected links. It is achieved by developing and comparing two-layer feedforward neural network model (neural network fitting), nonlinear autoregressive with external inputs (NARX) model, and nonlinear autoregressive model (NAR). Two links on I-85 freeway were selected for this study. The historical travel time data for the year 2014 and 2015 were collected from a private data source. The travel time was aggregated at 15-minute intervals. The developed models were tested by considering the travel time data for the year 2016. The results obtained indicate that NARX model outperformed the other two models, while NAR model performed better than the traditional neural network model for the selected links and data used in this research.",International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018.0,10,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569731?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569731, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ffda9d9eb229fe1b275d46bf16fe7bda72b7c938,Cross-Tier Interference Control Through Mode Selection and Resource Allocation (MSRA) in a D2D Network Using Uplink Frequency Reuse,"As the cellular mobile communication capacity is increasing every year people are demanding more robust, high speed and secure communication with low power consumption. To fulfill the requirement of the users, technology has been developing in an exponential manner and the data transmission rate and system capacity has been increased manifolds from past years. It is assumed that the population of cellular users will be increased by two fold till 2025. To improve throughput and capacity of cellular network a technology has been introduced in LTE-A which is Device to Device (D2D) communication. D2D is a 4.5G technology which was launched in 3GPP Release 12. The key challenges of D2D communication are controlling of transmission power, discovery of proximity devices, efficient allocation of available resource, and management of interference. Here in this paper we have provided an algorithm for the mode selection and resource allocation (MSRA) using an uplink channel reuse to control the cross-tier interference. The problems have been formulated in mathematical form, which is an NP-complete type problem. To solve such type of problem and reduce computational complexity we have proposed an algorithm. The results have been compared with [8] and a comparative study has been discussed.","2019 International Conference on Power Electronics, Control and Automation (ICPECA)",2019.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICPECA47973.2019.8975583?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPECA47973.2019.8975583, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Also, there is corresponding descriptive analysis on each data presented on the visualization tool. The web based interactive visualization tool developed is to help the IIS Regional department of the BFP-NCR Regional Branch generate statistical reports easier as compared to the current process that they are using wherein multiple MS excel-based reports will be generated from hard copy reports submitted by the local and municipal branches of each fire districts during post fire incident. As a result, generating the statistical reports will be harder since it will consume more time before generating the report because they will be referring at multiple MS excel file reports. This study aims in developing an interactive data visualization tool for the Investigation and Intelligence Section of the BFP-NCR Regional branch for history of fire incidents in Metro Manila in the year 2015–2018. The study is about a web-based interactive visualization tool in which users will filter to visualize the fire incidents based from charts, graphs, and mapping on a monthly or yearly basis, generate annual statistical reports and compare yearly or monthly fire incidents from the span of 2015–2018.",Information and Communication Technology Convergence,2019.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ictc46691.2019.8939895?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ictc46691.2019.8939895, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

They impact the way we live, work, and play and provide unprecedented opportunities to simplify our daily life and behavior. They implicate enormous potential and impact society, economy, and science. Due to the advancement of cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things technologies, it is expected that the majority of real-time data will be generated from devices interconnected within the Internet of Things by the year 2025. In this paper, we tackle the problem of managing Internet of Things data in an efficient way. To this end, we introduce the metric approach for storing and querying Internet of Things data and investigate the ability of pivot-based tables for indexing and searching this type of data. Along with the introduction of two real-world, large-scale Internet of Things datasets from the EU projects COMPOSITION and MONSOON (under grant no. 723145 and 723650), we show that the metric approach facilitates efficient data access in the Internet of Things.",2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2018.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/BigData.2018.8622387?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData.2018.8622387, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f7b9bd1b36e15c8489705b175d511de6789f43a3,ANTS for Human Exploration and Development of Space,"The proposed Autonomous Nano-technology Swarm (ANTS) is an enabling architecture for human/robotic mission envisaged by NASA's mission for the Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS). ANTS design principles draw on successes observed in the realm of social insect colonies, which include task specialization and sociality. ANTS spacecraft act as independent, autonomous agents for specific functions, while cooperating to achieve mission goals. For example, the Prospecting ANTS Mission (PAM) is a long-term mission concept for the 2020-2025 time frame involving individual spacecraft agents that are optimized for specific asteroid prospecting functions. The objective of PAM is to characterize at least one thousand asteroids during each year of operations in the main belt. To achieve this objective, PAM spacecraft, individually and as a group, must achieve a high level of autonomy. This high degree of autonomy opens the possibility of a new kind of interaction between humans and these spacecraft, where human explorers and developers could interact with ANTS enabled resources by communicating high-level goals and data products. Thus ANTS enables new kinds of missions in which human and robotic agents work together to achieve mission goals. In this paper we review and discuss the ANTS architecture in the context of the HEDS mission.",IEEE Aerospace Conference.

3a13ad2425b12fec1ead4f517250de70c20aea65,Tropical Cyclone Predicting System Model based on Ensemble Learning,"Every year, tropical cyclones cause a great deal of devastation and loss of life and property. Traditional strategies for forecasting tropical cyclone tracks pose various problems in terms of forecast reliability and precision as vast quantities of meteorological and tracking data continue to accumulate, Machine learning techniques have recently been competent enough to work with spatial and temporal features from a lot of data while being extremely efficient and accurate for forecasting data in big structures. Ensemble learning is a method of creating and combining several different models to solve a particular computational problem getting the highest precision. An ensemble can perform better and is able to make better predictions with better performance compared to a single model. The existing model uses the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) Model with Sanders Barotropic technology, deep learning applied with Convolutional Neural Network, and GRU using a dataset consisting of actual past hurricanes and cyclones occurring in the years 1945 to 2015, where the complex correlation of meteorological variables is not considered. Hence, we proposed, Boosting Tropical Cyclone Prediction Efficiency Through Time Series Analysis using an Ensemble Learning Approach. Hereby enabling support for Auto Correlation Analysis and reducing the dimension of input variables by removing irrelevant noise data. Ensemble Analysis is done efficiently in this use case giving us better prediction accuracy.

627ed303ecc0fa5052dbaec2e8b85b34b77fe532,A Statistical Analysis of the Staff Data to Evaluate the Influence of the Retention Factors in the NHS England,"The National Health Service (NHS) has 1.3 million staff who care for the people of England with skill, compassion, and dedication. Between 1 January 2020 - 31 March 2020, there were 84,393 advertised vacancy full-time equivalents in NHS England. Among them, around 40% is Nursing and Midwifery Registered Staff Group. To tackle the staff shortage, NHS needs to spend about £480m per year on temporary staff. This paper presents an investigation of the three complementary methods to analyse retention data: (i) one that explores comparisons for engagement and retention within a year, (ii) differences across organisations in any observable or unobservable predictors and finally, (iii) the focuses on changes within NHS trusts across several years. Generally, a higher level of staff engagement indicates a better retention rate; but the findings of this investigation demonstrate a reverse result. Highly likely unmeasured external factors may influence the outputs, and possible factors may be organisation restructure, local labour market variations and more subtle between trust types. The latent Growth Curve model statistical technique is used to estimate growth trajectories. Using this technique, we estimated the change over time in staff retention. It shows a clear positive link between changes in engagement and changes in retention.

5cd207335eed9a6a409f39e636aa9bfaede5853a,Characterization of Assessments on a First Programming Course in Higher Education,"The present research introduces a characterization of the questions in summative assessments (tests) for an introductory programming course in higher education, developed for first-year engineering students. This characterization is a first approach that examines the disparity between the thematic contents declared in the course syllabus and those effectively present in the assessments. It also explores the difficulty level and context in which each question is presented. Additionally, a detailed review of the course's process for test building was performed, and its results allow one to conclude that the amount of time dedicated to the test building itself might be too scarce. Some of the results of this research expose that 36.8% of the declared contents in the course syllabus have been explicitly evaluated in tests, using mainly simulated situations as context for the questions (52.9%). The possibility that there might be a link between the difficulty of a question, its contents, and the given context also emerges; nonetheless, more research is required to properly assess this claim. The timeframe considered in this research includes from the second half of 2015 until the second half of 2019, in pre-pandemic conditions.",International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society,2022.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/SCCC57464.2022.10000367?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/SCCC57464.2022.10000367, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

765dbad878561978c671d6cb6e1de89f6653087b,Spatiotemporal Analysis of $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ Variation in the Nanjing City Using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition,"With the continuous process of urbanization in China, in the recent few years, the air pollution in Nanjing city has intensified. The occurrence rate of haze has been increasing year by year, having a negative impact on public health and the ecosystem. Moreover, the issue of poor air quality has been receiving more and more attention from the public. Therefore, a thorough study of the spatial and temporal characteristics of air pollution in Nanjing has great practical significance and a potential for practical application. In this study, inhalable particular matter $(\text{PM}_{2.5})$ was selected as the research object. Based on the hourly data released by 13 air pollution monitoring stations in Nanjing over the past year, we used the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method to analyze the time-scale and the spatial distribution variation characteristics of $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ in Nanjing. The results show: the $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentration in Nanjing had a quasi-periodic variation of 25–30 days on a daily scale, and 1.6-2 months on a monthly scale; the $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentration air pollution index showed four kinds of variation trends during the period from June 2015 to March 2016, namely, continuously increasing, continuously decreasing, increasing first then decreasing, and decreasing first then increasing. If considering the spatial distribution, the concentrations of $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ in the study area increased from north to south during the period from June to August 2015; while it remained basically the same from September to November 2015 and from January to March 2016, respectively. In addition, the spatial distribution of $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ in the study area showed large discrepancies during the month of December 2015, and in some areas, the air pollution was extremely high.",GEOINFORMATICS,2022.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/Geoinformatics57846.2022.9963858?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/Geoinformatics57846.2022.9963858, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

67a927e7d6ab26fa14bfae0e77047b7982163563,Green backhauling for heterogeneous mobile access networks: What are the challenges?,"Heterogeneous network (HetNet) deployment strategies have the potential to improve the energy efficiency of mobile access networks. One key aspect to consider in HetNets is the impact of the power consumption of the backhaul, i.e., the overall energy efficiency of a HetNet deployment is affected by the backhaul technology and architecture. This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the design challenges of a future green backhaul segment for a HetNet deployment. The study is based on the analysis of the medium term future outlook (i.e., between now and the year 2025) of the main technologies used in todays'* backhaul networks (i.e., fiber, microwave and copper). It can be concluded that, even if there arc no doubts that both microwave and fiber will be predominately used in the future, the possible migration paths leading to such fiber- and microwave-dominated scenarios might be different, depending on factors such as spectrum and license costs, time to deployment, availability of equipment, and required Quality of Service (QoS) levels.","International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing",2013.0,17,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICICS.2013.6782868?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2013.6782868, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4cc321f8df15df1f7a783f65570877fca191d5d7,A Landscape Study of Computer Science Education in NYC: Early Findings and Implications for Policy and Practice,"NYC's Computer Science for All (CS4All) is a 10-year, districtwide initiative aimed at providing high-quality computer science (CS) education to all NYC public school students. It aspires to greatly increase the number of students, teachers, and schools exposed to CS in NYC, and to offer meaningful learning experiences that build on prior exposure and skills at every grade level. These plans include providing high-quality professional development (PD) to some 5,000 teachers, designed to help them learn new programs and pedagogies in CS education, as well as strategies for integrating CS into existing courses. This paper presents findings from an assessment of CS in NYC, conducted in the second year of the CS4All initiative. Using a telephone survey of a representative sample of schools, we describe the current state of CS programming and training in the City. Overall, we found high participation in CS teacher training opportunities (both through and independent of the initiative) and widespread offering of CS courses Specifically, we estimate just over half of schools districtwide (56%) participated in some type of CS training in the 2015-16 school year, and about two thirds of schools (64%) offered students some kind of CS coursework in the 2016-17 school year (through either stand-alone CS courses or the integration of CS into other subjects). The type of programming and training varied by school level (elementary, middle and high). We also explored the extent to which programming and training are reaching schools and students who are historically underrepresented in CS--including women and girls, students of color, low-income students and students with disabilities. We found that schools offering CS courses and activities served fewer Black and Latino students and more White and Asian Students, compared with schools not offering CS. This work is unique, as it is the only districtwide assessment of CS education conducted anywhere in the country to date, thus adding to an under-researched but important and growing field of study",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2018.0,31,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3159450.3159467?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3159450.3159467, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2ebbd5fa830c165a36fa960c7c13f298a2de4b94,Analysis and Design of Decision Support System Dashboard for Predicting Student Graduation Time,"Information Systems is one of the existing study program at Telkom University that has produced many graduates since it was established in 2008. However, not all graduates produced successfully completed the study period during the four years of normal study. The percentage of graduates on time has some decline between the target and the achievement of the study program. From academic year 2014/2015 to 2016/2017 decrease annually about 1% every year, which is it becomes problems for the credibility and existence of study program and also for academic planners who may have an impact on accreditation assessment process of the study program when it is audited. One of the efforts that can be done by the study program to increase the students on time graduation rate is by making decision support system dashboard that giving early warning to the lecturer or the head of the study program if there are students who are predicted not to graduate on time. By using the C4.5 algorithm to perform the data analysis by looking at the causes of student’s graduation time and pureshare methodology to perform dashboard development method. The result of this study is a prototype of decision support system dashboard, because there are lack of analysis in decision making and the dashboard only showing information and temporary prediction. The data model that used on this research is labeling data that has been processed using C4.5 algorithm and data that has been through data cleansing process using Pentaho Data Integration. This prototype is expected to be used as a reference base to support academic planners in order to make this application run with real time data.","2018 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)",2018.0,8,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.11591/eecsi.v5.1706', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EECSI.2018.8752876?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EECSI.2018.8752876, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

5d8281eeff0058dcaebea1e7cf20fa0675f94d8d,LAunchPad: The Design and Evaluation of a STEM Recruitment Program for Women,"This paper presents the design and evaluation of a university-sponsored summer STEM recruitment program for young women between their junior and senior year in high school. The College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology (ECST) currently has a female enrollment of only 15%, which is below the national average of 20%. The College has set a goal of increasing the percentage of women to 25% by 2025. The recruitment program described in this paper is one of the strategies the ECST will use to reach its goal. The objectives of the recruitment program, LAunchPad, were to increase the students’ interest in engineering and computer science, and to achieve a 50% participant matriculation rate into the College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology. LAunchPad established a gender-inclusive learning environment, with scaffolded instruction and hands-on activities to reinforce the learning. The students were also introduced to two groups of female role models; the first group was early-career alumni that held technical positions with local companies, and the second group was mid- to senior-level engineers, computer scientists, and executives. A post-event survey revealed that the students’ interest in pursuing an engineering or computer science career increased by 29%; seventy percent applied for admission to the University for the following Fall. Results suggest that contributing factors to the students’ increased interest are an increased understanding of engineering and computer science, increased confidence, access to diverse role models, and the ability to establish peer networks.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2018.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659097?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659097, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f74f614f33b851759f492989e11340d0431818c0,A comparison study of outpatient visits forecasting effect between ARIMA with seasonal index and SARIMA,"This paper delineates a case study analyzing and forecasting of the outpatient visits frequency of a hospital in Zhengzhou, China. By evaluating the annual out-patient data throughout the year of 2015, this paper applies the “Day” as timescale and carries out the experiment so as to forecast the number of visiting patients with the impact of the “Week” taken into consideration. Two models are used separately: the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with seasonal index and the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA).

9bc03cb06bd8cfc1ab01279c7028590899b1623c,Research on the operating mode of the power supply for a telecom base station based on the peak & valley model of the power grid,"With the development of mobile communication technology, communication system requires significantly more electricity, according to statistics, in the year 2015 a company mobile base station's power charge reached ¥750 million Yuan. Considering the implementation of the peak and valley price mechanism in some areas, and how battery technology has developed, this paper presents the peak and valley operating mode of a communication base station power supply system, and analyzes and evaluates the operation benefit. The controller of base station power can set the peak and valley time freely according to the peak and valley price model and the battery capacity, and support single peak operation and multi-peak operating mode. The Battery's power is used as much as possible during peak period, battery power is used preferentially during the flat hump period, and the power grid charges the battery and power communication base station in the valley period. This can greatly reduce the peak period electricity consumption, is conducive to lower operating costs and stable operation of the power grid. With the application of a hybrid energy system in a communication base station, the hybrid power supply system is introduced to reduce the demand for battery capacity and reduce the grid's power consumption. The research shows that the operating mode based on the grid peak and valley model can greatly reduce operating costs, and because of the introduction of solar energy, it achieves an energy-saving emission reduction, and also helps to further expand economic benefits.",International Telecommunications Energy Conference,2017.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/INTLEC.2017.8214188?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/INTLEC.2017.8214188, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

For this purpose, this paper proposes the load forecasting model based on higher order partial least squares, which is much simpler than artificial intelligence techniques in complexity. Considering the nonlinear relationship between dependent variables and independent variables, an extended input tensor is employed in the load forecasting model. Finally, load data of year 2015 in the ISO New England is used to verify the rationality and feasibility of proposed method.

It is therefore very important to the utilities to have advance knowledge of their electrical load. One of the important points for forecasting the long-term load in Japan is to take into account the past and present economic situations and power demand. These points were considered in this study.

39ec654f819048fcfa37872985b8ee0fbbfb424c,Hybrid Artificial Neural Networks Based Models for Electricity Spot Price Forecasting - A Review,"Electricity price forecasting plays a crucial role in a liberalized electricity market. In terms of forecasting approaches, artificial neural networks are the most popular among researchers due to their flexibility and efficiency in handling complexity and non-linearity. On the other hand, a single neural network presents certain limitations. Therefore, in recent years, hybrid models that combine multiple algorithms to balance out the advantages of a single model have become a trend. However, a review of recent applications of hybrid neural networks based models with respect to electricity price forecasting is not found in the literature and hence, the motivation of this paper is to fill this research gap. In this study, methodologies of existing forecasting approaches are briefly summarized, followed by reviews of neural network based hybrid models concerning electricity forecasting from year 2015 onwards. Major contributions of each study, datasets adopted in experiments as well as the corresponding experiment results are analyzed. Apart from the review of existing studies, the novelty and advantages of each type of hybrid model are discussed in detail. Scope of the review is the application of hybrid neural network models. It is found that the forecast horizon of the reviewed literature is either hour ahead or day ahead. Medium and long term forecasting are not comprehensively studied. In addition, though hybrid models require relatively large computational time, time measurements are not reported in any of the reviewed literature.",2019 16th International Conference on the European Energy Market (EEM),2019.0,1,0,"{'url': 'https://du.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1379712/FULLTEXT02', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'other-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EEM.2019.8916245?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EEM.2019.8916245, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The catastrophe brought by an epidemic not only effects the people of an area, but also brings about a lot of distress in every sector of social strata. An epidemic alerting system has a potential to carve the path how medical surveillance could become more efficient. The epidemic causing diseases are usually vector borne. The diseases are spread by pathogens present in these vectors. An epidemic alerting system could predict how the weather conditions and several other factors effect the growth and propagation of these vectors. The weather conditions could be predicted using the high-end instruments and satellites currently available. Using this prediction, we could forecast the next targets of the epidemic. To implement this epidemic alert system, four algorithms are used namely Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Support Vector Regression and Multiple Linear Regression. For dengue, the state wise cases data of the year 2013 to 2017 has been used in the system while for chikungunya the data used is of the year 2013 to 2016. This dataset has been downloaded from a government website, i.e., https://www.data.gov.in/. For the case of dengue, the model has been trained on the data of the year 2013 to 2016 and predictions of the year 2017 have been done. On the other hand, the model has been trained on the data of the year 2013 to 2015 and predictions for the year 2017 have been made regarding Chikungunya.

Training datasets are obtained from year-groupings of 2015, 2014-2015, 2013-2015, and 2012-2015. The test dataset is represented by 2016 data. Our study utilizes five popular learners and five class ratios obtained by Random Undersampling. Using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve as the performance metric, our case study indicates that the Logistic Regression learner yields the highest overall value for the yeargrouping of 2013-2015, with a majority-to-minority ratio of 90:10. For the problem of maintaining predictive models for Medicare fraud, we conclude that a sampled dataset should be chosen over the full dataset and that the largest training dataset (i.e., 2012- 2015) does not always produce the best results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first big data study that examines the influence of time on the maintenance of machine learning models.",International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications,2019.0,6,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00304?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00304, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The proposed day-ahead forecasting approach is based on a hybrid model consisting of Imperialistic Competitive Algorithm (ICA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is built using two years (2015 - 2016) of hourly data from various buildings in the Otaniemi area of Espoo, Finland. Day-ahead forecast models are also developed using Persistence and four other AI based techniques. Comparative forecasting performance analysis among these techniques was performed. The proposed ICA-SVM heat demand forecasting model is tested and validated using an out-of-sample one-year (2017) hourly data of the buildings’ district heat consumption. The prediction results are presented for the out-of-sample testing days in a one-hour time interval. The validation results demonstrate that the devised model is able to predict the buildings’ heat demand with an improved accuracy and short computation time. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates outperformed prediction accuracy improvement, compared to the other five evaluated models.",International Conference on Industrial Informatics,2019.0,5,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/INDIN41052.2019.8972297?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN41052.2019.8972297, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Changes in heart rate in humans can be known through the flow of blood that flows in blood vessels. When the heart beats, the flow in the blood vessels will move so that's when the heart rate can be measured. In this study, a wireless heart rate condition data collection system will be developed and a heart rate condition sensing device that has the same capabilities as devices used in general medical activities. From the results of testing, the system designed the process of sending data goes well where of the 20 devices that send data all of that can be sent properly with a time interval of 1 second but for the sensor reading process some problem need to be solved such as interruptions in the data collection process when participants doing activities and some constraints on the choice of devices used on the server.","2019 International Conference on Informatics, Multimedia, Cyber and Information System (ICIMCIS)",2019.0,5,0,"{'url': 'http://eprints.uad.ac.id/40138/1/HASIL%20CEK_PROSIDING%201.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICIMCIS48181.2019.8985210?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIMCIS48181.2019.8985210, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

f7728db9d6df649e6dca83ef87734cebca1e7152,Machine learning approach as an alternative tool to build a bankruptcy prediction model in banking industry,"This paper focuses on the study of a bankruptcy prediction model using a hybrid machine learning that combines two synergistic algorithms i.e. two-class boosted decision tree and multi-class decision forest. The hybrid model ensures the building of multiple decision trees whereby the latest tree corrects the previous tree, learning from the tagged data and subsequently votes on the most popular tree as the final decision of the ensemble. This hybrid machine learning is proposed to be an alternative of the bankruptcy prediction models that is able to produce three major classifications i.e. bankruptcy, grey area, and non-bankruptcy. There are five variables considered in the hybrid model which consist of working capital for total assets, retained by total asset, earnings before interest and taxes on total asset, market value of equity to total bank value of liabilities and sales of total asset. These input data are applied and tested to the public dataset produced by Bank Indonesia from year 2011-2015. The hybrid model shows a significant result whereby the overall area under curve (AUC) had successfully achieved 95% value that indicates the capability of the hybrid model to train the test data and identify the relationship of input-output data. This finding suggests that the machine learning approach can be treated as an alternative tool to build a bankruptcy prediction model for banking industry.

This paper applies four different machine learning models namely, Support vector machines (SVM), Regression tree (RT), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), and a hybrid combination of SVM-PLSR to multi-year WNV data sets. Precisely, historical data sets ranging from 2005–2015 was used to predict trap counts for 2016. This paper also discusses a tree-based data visualization technique for displaying historical trap counts. The visualization model is designed to focus on identifying trends in the behavior of Culex tarsalis by tracking parameters such as meteorological data, dead birds, WNV cases, human cases, and deaths. The preliminary results indicate that SVM model outperforms interms of accuracy than other machine learning models.

BioMa can be extended by the third parties who can add new modeling solutions to meet their requirements of crop modeling. CropSyst is an advanced model for crop growth simulation in the world. CropSyst model has been embedded in BioMa platform with some improvements, for example, with less default parameters, different model algorithm and more user-friendly interface, and links to other model solutions etc. Agricultural production system is increasingly threatened by climate change, the CropSyst model imbedded in BioMa in 2015 year was used to simulate and predict crop. Based on the latest BioMa-site model, and using LAI data, soil, crop phenology, above ground BioMass and yield data from 2012 to 2014 which come from 11 counties of winter wheat main producing areas in Hengshui city, Hebei province, North China, this paper firstly calibrated some model's parameters and evaluated the CropSyst model by comparing model estimates to field data, and after that, simulated and predicted the winter wheat BioMass and yield in “near-future” around 2030 (2021–2040) and “far-future” around 2050 (2041–2060) based on BioMa spatial, and compared model estimates results under two different future climate scenarios. The simulated results showed that using CropSyst model to simulate the winter wheat yield of North China is promising. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between observed yield and simulated yield is 0.97, the Modelling Efficiency is 0.94, and the Index of Agreement is 0.98. The winter wheat dry yield is higher in “near-future” around 2030(2021-2040) than “far-future” around 2050(2041-2060) both in climate scenario No. 1 and climate No. 9 based on 15grids mean data in North China, and dry AGB has the same tendency. Under both climate scenarios, winter wheat yield and above ground BioMass are much lower with irrigation situation, which showed that moister is a key factor to winter wheat during the growth. This study got a set of parameters that proved to be suitable to simulate winter wheat growth process and production in China and predicted future yield based on different climate scenarios and condition which could be a reference for future wheat management and national policy.",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics,2018.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/AGRO-GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8475998?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/AGRO-GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8475998, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A Guided Exercise permits students to relate models and help them to solve a complex exercise step by step. This strategy was used in a Civil Engineering Course, Soil Mechanics II, in the academic year 2015/16. The results show that students considered the strategy useful for the understanding of the concepts covered in the course. Analysing the academic performance, it can be concluded that students that used this methodology had better marks in the exam and, also, a better approval ratio.",2018 3rd International Conference of the Portuguese Society for Engineering Education (CISPEE),2018.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CISPEE.2018.8593466?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CISPEE.2018.8593466, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2e688f980a781b833fc3ff26b7f2edc590e203c4,An approach for the use of Learning Objects in teaching computer programming concepts,"The teaching of algorithms and programming concepts to students of the first years of Computer Science course has been a major challenge, because students often have difficulty understanding the subject, leading to a high dropout rate. At our institution, dropout rate in the first year of the Computer Science course is 26%, which led us to think of pedagogical strategies to reduce this number. The use of Learning Objects (LO) has gained ground in higher education, but few experiments have been developed to help teach programming concepts to students in the early years. In other experiments, we applied the use of LO in the teaching of programming concepts. However, one of the difficulties encountered in our previous experiences was to identify the ideal moment to introduce the LO to students. Therefore, in 2015 we conducted a new experiment with two groups of students, using a LO to teach Sorting concepts. For the first group we introduced the LO before the professor started teaching theoretical concepts. For the second group, the professor initially taught the theoretical concepts, and only later was the LO introduced. This study aims to present the methodology used to carry out the experiment and the results achieved.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2016.0,9,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757619?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757619, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e97a5be7656137c086a7b4e9f6c1a74a3df1dea8,Research on Robot Education in Primary School,"This paper mainly discusses robot education in primary school. Robot education refers to theories and practices of learning basic knowledge and skills of robot, or optimizing education and teaching results by robot education. The entry of robot education into primary school explores the educational function and value of robot, promotes quality-oriented education, and trains information literacy and technical literacy of primary school students, which has an importantly practical and strategic significance on promoting the innovation and practical capacity of primary school students. 1. Research Background Robot technology, as an important indicator of implementing “Made in China 2025” and developing “Industry 4.0”, is an indispensably key technology in the global industrialization, developing with the high speed of 20% each year. Robot technology drives the development of scientific and technological innovation. In The 17 Academician Assembly of Chinese Academy of Sciences and The 12 Academician Assembly of Chinese Academy of Engineering held on June 9, 2014, Xi Jinping pointed that “We not only need to improve the robot technology, also need to occupy the market as much as possible; robot reform is expected to become a breakthrough point and an important growth point of The Third Industrial Revolution, to affect the global manufacturing pattern, and China will become the biggest robot market in the whole world.” There have been a dozen years for the entry of robot education into China’s primary education system. However, all are competition programs. In recent years, several primary schools began introduce robot teaching into classroom. Whereas, it began relatively late, and there is not mature teaching mode for robot teaching for reference. 2. Research Significance For recent years, various kinds of robot competitions are held in China one by one, and there are more and more students participating in robot competition. However, schools and students are faced with a dilemma, which is the lack of robot curriculum resources, especially for pupils. The lack of supporting curriculum resources is the main cause. In 2015, Chinese Institute of Electronics launched Qualification Certify for National Youth Robotics Level Test. Primary and secondary school students in China can verify their robot robotics level with the aid of this platform. It specifies the standards for robot education in primary and secondary schools, identifies its development direction, and promotes its healthy and stable development. Education-based robot curriculum in primary school can not only promote the development of robot education in primary school, also enrich the robot curriculum in schools. As for the training of students’ practical capacity, China strongly advocates the quality-oriented education in primary and secondary school, however, actual education is mainly exam-oriented education, which pays attentions to general knowledge courses, and ignores the training of other capacities of students, especially the training of students’ practical capacity. Robot education can reasonably and effectively solve the contradiction. At present, only a small amount of students participating in robot competition are benefited. Generally, practical capacity is one of capabilities that students lack most. Robot education can train students’ practical capacity to greatest extent and promote the rapid development of robot education in schools. 6th International Education, Economics, Social Science, Arts, Sports and Management Engineering Conference (IEESASM 2018) Copyright © 2019, the Authors.

a283593c91a3424a29fb4c50895093a8ca42ded3,Technology Options for Beyond-CMOS,"CMOS integrated circuit technology for computation is at an inflexion point. Although this is the technology which has enabled the semiconductor industry to make vast progress over the past 30-plus years, it is expected to see challenges going beyond the ten year horizon, particularly from an energy efficiency point of view. Thus it is extremely important for the semiconductor industry to discover a new integrated circuit technology which can carry us to the beyond CMOS era, so that the power-performance of computing can continue to improve. Currently, researchers are exploring novel device concepts and new information tokens as an alternative for CMOS technology. Examples of areas being actively researched are; quantum electronic devices, such as the tunneling field-effect transistor (TFET), and devices based on electron spin and nano-magnetics (spintronics). It is clear that choices will need to be made in the next 10 years to identify viable alternatives for CMOS by 2025. To prioritize and guide the research exploration in materials, devices and circuits, benchmarking methodology and metrics are being used. This talk will give an overview of the beyond CMOS device research horizon and the benchmarking of these devices for computation. A more detailed investigation of circuits based upon some promising beyond-CMOS devices will follow.",ACM International Symposium on Physical Design,2017.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3036669.3041225?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3036669.3041225, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To get better predictability, Adaboost integration algorithm, which is a classic machine learning algorithm and can use multiple kinds of forecasting variables, is introduced to predict yearly stock returns of all the firms of A-Share market from 2011 to 2015. The predictability is considerably improved. The average yearly out-of-sample error rate from 2013 to 2015 is 22%. The average yearly out-of-sample error rate from 2011 to 2015 is 27%. By analyzing data of the five years we find phenomena as following. First, the most important forecasting variable is different in each year when the market index shows different trend. Second, industry category plays very important role in every year.

Outlier detection is one field of research in data mining. One of the outlier detection algorithms is the Enhanced Class Outlier Distance Based (ECODB) algorithm. In this paper, the ECODB algorithm is used to identify outliers on national exam results, integrity index and accreditation level of senior high schools in the Yogyakarta province year 2015. An experiment by varying number of outlier and varying number of nearest neighbor were done to identify the value of N and K that result on smallest Class Outlier Factor (COF). The identified N and K were then used to find out schools that are classified as outliers. Further decriptive analysis of the schools were then performed, afterward.",Proceedings of the International Conference of Science and Technology for the Internet of Things,2019.0,0,0,"{'url': 'http://eudl.eu/pdf/10.4108/eai.19-10-2018.2282539', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.4108/EAI.19-10-2018.2282539?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.4108/EAI.19-10-2018.2282539, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0633832760a2b89364b5020e2d85e3dde707838f,Beyond Counting: New Perspectives on the Active IPv4 Address Space,"In this study, we report on techniques and analyses that enable us to capture Internet-wide activity at individual IP address-level granularity by relying on server logs of a large commercial content delivery network (CDN) that serves close to 3 trillion HTTP requests on a daily basis. Across the whole of 2015, these logs recorded client activity involving 1.2 billion unique IPv4 addresses, the highest ever measured, in agreement with recent estimates. Monthly client IPv4 address counts showed constant growth for years prior, but since 2014, the IPv4 count has stagnated while IPv6 counts have grown. Thus, it seems we have entered an era marked by increased complexity, one in which the sole enumeration of active IPv4 addresses is of little use to characterize recent growth of the Internet as a whole. With this observation in mind, we consider new points of view in the study of global IPv4 address activity. Our analysis shows significant churn in active IPv4 addresses: the set of active IPv4 addresses varies by as much as 25% over the course of a year. Second, by looking across the active addresses in a prefix, we are able to identify and attribute activity patterns to networkm restructurings, user behaviors, and, in particular, various address assignment practices. Third, by combining spatio-temporal measures of address utilization with measures of traffic volume, and sampling-based estimates of relative host counts, we present novel perspectives on worldwide IPv4 address activity, including empirical observation of under-utilization in some areas, and complete utilization, or exhaustion, in others.",ACM/SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference,2016.0,50,6,"{'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00360', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00360, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This paper aims to find a monotonic classifier by using the potential order information in data. The proposed method consists of two stages. First, a feature selection algorithm, which is specially designed for monotonic classification, is applied to evaluate the importance of features. Then, a fraud detection system for predicting fraudulent firms is designed based on a monotonic decision tree algorithm to improve the classification performance. In order to establish predictive indicators for the classification of suspicious companies, the audit office of India has collected detailed one-year unclassified data of 777 companies from 2015 to 2016.

1291b4b94e2f5541443d82dae3ebb90c18da6e39,Predicting the Dynamics of Forest Fire Spread from Satellite Imaging Using Deep Learning,"The most common hazard in forests is wildfire. These fires present a challenge to the invaluable forest resources and the natural ecosystem of plants and animals, gravely upsetting the biodiversity and ecology of a region. Wildfires are a perennial problem and are spread across the world irrespective of the terrain, demographic and ecological conditions or human intervention. The recent outbreaks of the West California Valley Wildfire(2018) and The Amazon WildFire(2019) show our inability in controlling, inhibiting, and predicting these disasters. Taking into account the statistics from last year, India witnessed a 41 percent increase in the number of wildfires in the last decade(2009-2019), witnessing a 125 % spike (from 15,937 to 35,888) in such fires in a span of just 2 years from 2015 to 2017. This paper is an attempt to simulate the spread of forest fires and to help the necessary authorities identify the best cut off points to obliterate the fire. We developed a dynamic model by modelling the problem as Markov Decision Process, treating wildfire as an agent advancing over the effective region in response to surrounding parameters. At any point of time, the fire can choose to move in either of the 4 cardinal or the 4 ordinal directions or not spread at all. Analysing satellite images in sequence, we use LRCN(Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks) to build a generative model for input to the Markov Reinforcement Learning Model.","International Conference Electronic Systems, Signal Processing and Computing Technologies [ICESC-]",2020.0,2,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/icesc48915.2020.9155734?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/icesc48915.2020.9155734, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As a result, new courses are being developed that connect research, pedagogy and technology within this nascent field. An example of this is Western University's Computational Thinking in Mathematics and Science Education course, which has been offered in year one of the Bachelor of Education program since 2015 and is part of the STEM cohort. Research has been conducted during each iteration of the course and subsequent adjustments were made in order to better serve the preservice teachers as well as respond to new insights in the field. The preservice teachers have completed at least one university degree, mostly in the areas of science or mathematics, prior to beginning their Bachelor of Education degree. This lightning talk presents highlights from the most recent version of the course following this iterative process of course design. The 36-hour course provides pre-service teachers with opportunities to explore hands-on-activities and theoretical-based approaches to Computational Thinking and pedagogy in grades 7-12, all within a blended learning context. The researchers will be further studying the pre-service teacher experience and are looking to provide recommendations for other preservice teacher education programs as well as in-service professional development programs.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2020.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3328778.3372571?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3372571, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

44c1e65299b6670ca925d683f91ee901662aefcd,A Manifold Learning Data Enrichment Methodology for Homicide Prediction,"Not all types of crime have the same priority in the agendas of policymakers since society tends to be more reluctant to more violent and costly crimes such as homicide. However, relative to other types of crime, homicides are statistically more challenging due to its sparsity and low frequency. For instance, over the last five years the average number of homicides across the city of Bogota has been roughly a thousand events per year, compared to the more than one hundred thousand robberies reported in the same period. Nevertheless, more than 80% of the homicides in the city occur during street fights suggesting a strong spatial and temporal correlation between these two types of crime. With this in mind, we used a manifold learning approach that capitalizes on a rich dataset of street fights to discover a criminal manifold that we use to penalize a KDE model of homicides where sparsity and low frequency is an issue. To implement this we follow a Kernel Warping methodology (Zhou & Matteson, 2015). The methodology reduces the relevant space for homicide prediction to regions of the city where homicides or street fights have occurred, giving more weight to the homicide episodes. We also introduce a temporal decay component to place a larger importance to recent events. The proposed model outperforms a standard KDE trained with homicide data, a KDE trained in both homicide and street fights data for homicide prediction, and a standard self-exciting point process on homicide data: flagging just the 5% of the area of the city with the highest estimated density, the Kernel Warping model correctly identifies between 30% and 35% of the homicides in the test set.11Results of the project “Diseño y validación de modelos de analítica predictiva de fenómenos de seguridad y convivencia para la toma de decisiones en Bogotá” funded by Colciencias with resources from the Sistema General de Regalías, BPIN 2016000100036.

9a993f682dac64126a374a8a13c878ce61eb5119,Does an open-ended design project increase creativity in engineering students?,"Many schools are incorporating project-based interdisciplinary exercises into their engineering curriculum in order to develop the qualitative and quantitative skills simultaneously. It has been shown that introducing design in a freshman engineering course has a positive impact on retention, stimulates interest in engineering and enhances communication, teaming and time management skills. But can design also improve creativity? Or, to be more specific, would an open-ended design project improve creativity in engineering students? In the fall of 2015, an innovative design project was used in a first-year engineering course at Michigan Technological University. Students were given the task to develop a prototype of a new product or an improvement on an existing product. While some of the tasks were defined throughout the semester, the product they created was completely up to the team. It was thought that the open-ended nature of the project and the product itself being new or innovative would help improve their creativity. Students completing this project were given a 55 question pre- and post-assessment. This assessment included several measures of general creativity and entrepreneurial intentions: Oreg's Resistance to Change Scale (RTC), the Curiosity and Exploration Inventory (CEI), and the Zampetakis & Moustakis Scale (Z & M Scale).

29bc210f7699b58d642ed3a98f9b0e973fdb1621,Rust: from POPL to practice (keynote),"In 2015, a language based fundamentally on substructural typing–Rust–hit its 1.0 release, and less than a year later it has been put into production use in a number of tech companies, including some household names. The language has started a trend, with several other mainstream languages, including C++ and Swift, in the early stages of incorporating ideas about ownership. How did this come about? Rust’s core focus is safe systems programming. It does not require a runtime system or garbage collector, but guarantees memory safety. It does not stipulate any particular style of concurrent programming, but instead provides the tools needed to guarantee data race freedom even when doing low-level shared-state concurrency. It allows you to build up high-level abstractions without paying a tax; its compilation model ensures that the abstractions boil away. These benefits derive from two core aspects of Rust: its ownership system (based on substructural typing) and its trait system (a descendant of Haskell’s typeclasses). The talk will cover these two pillars of Rust design, with particular attention to the key innovations that make the language usable at scale.

At the same time, the security threat of smart phone is growing. According to “Motive Security Labs Malware Report-H1 2015” [1] report, the number of Android malware is growing year by year. Many researchers focus on the security of Android applications based on permission. Felt et al. [2] designed the stowaway tool to detect the application's over-privilege. This tool can also identify and quantify the over-privilege triggered by developer errors. Enck et al. [3] proposed a security mechanism called Kirin. The Kirin consisted of nine permission rules. The more rules the application has, the more dangerous it is.

0fd7ca09bb1cf708412addd4bd992cbcecc944fd,Development of a 3.2MW Photovoltaic Inverter for Large-Scale PV Power Plants,"The penetration of large-scale PV power plants, accompanied with the increase of the lengths of DC cables, the number of PV strings, combiner boxes, and other related equipment, have increased the conduction losses in the system. Therefore, in recent years, system DC voltage of PV plants has been increased to 1500V in order to reduce conduction losses by current passing through their components. The photovoltaic inverter rated 1500V-2.5MW had been developed in 2015. This inverter had firstly been certificated for UL certification of DC1500V photovoltaic inverter in the world in 2016. On the other hand, PV system cost required in the market is decreasing every year. Especially, the cost per output watt is attracted attention. In order to reduce its cost, larger-capacity inverter was developed in spite of using the same cabinet. This paper presents the development of a 3.2MW photovoltaic inverter with DC1500V. This inverter achieved high conversion efficiency by applying the three-level inverter topology which is a neutral point switch type, commonly known as T- type three-level inverter. The performance of the 1500V-3.2MW rated inverter was confirmed by verification.",2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia),2018.0,6,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507363?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507363, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is partially intended to explain the context of DUNE Computing for computing specialists.
The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) collaboration consists of over 180 institutions from 33 countries. The experiment is in preparation now, with commissioning of the first 10kT fiducial volume Liquid Argon TPC expected over the period 2025-2028 and a long data taking run with 4 modules expected from 2029 and beyond.
An active prototyping program is already in place with a short test-beam run with a 700T, 15,360 channel prototype of single-phase readout at the Neutrino Platform at CERN in late 2018 and tests of a similar sized dual-phase detector scheduled for mid-2019. The 2018 test-beam run was a valuable live test of our computing model. The detector produced raw data at rates of up to 2GB/s. These data were stored at full rate on tape at CERN and Fermilab and replicated at sites in the UK and Czech Republic. In total 1.2 PB of raw data from beam and cosmic triggers were produced and reconstructed during the six week testbeam run.
Baseline predictions for the full DUNE detector data, starting in the late 2020’s are 30-60 PB of raw data per year. In contrast to traditional HEP computational problems, DUNE’s Liquid Argon TPC data consist of simple but very large (many GB) 2D data objects which share many characteristics with astrophysical images. This presents opportunities to use advances in machine learning and pattern recognition as a frontier user of High Performance Computing facilities capable of massively parallel processing.",EPJ Web of Conferences,2020.0,4,0,"{'url': 'https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2020/21/epjconf_chep2020_11002.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09037, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In 2015, the state of Tennessee (TN) launched TN Promise, a scholarship and mentoring program that enables tuition-free attendance at two-year community colleges for eligible Tennessee high school graduates. With over 18,000 students already enrolled in TN Promise, the number of students who may choose to transfer to four-year institutions is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. To prepare for the expected influx of transfer students, and to address known barriers transfer students face, we have designed the Academic Intervention, Social Supports and Scholarships for Engineering Transfer Students program (ASSETS). While transfer students are ready for college, they often face institutional barriers to success that need addressing, particularly in Engineering.The ASSETS program is a comprehensive support ecosystem designed to improve retention and reduce time to graduation for engineering transfer students. In the second year of operation, with 23 enrolled ASSETS scholars, the program has implemented and begun studying the effectiveness of evidence-based strategies to reduce these institutional barriers to success, improve retention rates, and reduce time to graduation among engineering transfer students.This paper presents the initial findings and outcomes of the ASSETS program to enhance opportunities and success of transfer students.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2020.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274046?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274046, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Indonesia had been producing bioethanol from 2007 – 2010 from molasses. The research aims to give the projection of bioethanol supply – demand in Indonesia to fulfill the mandatory target of bioethanol utilization in 2025. Using system dynamics modeling, bioethanol production is modeled by identifying the variables and the relations. The modeling and simulation is conducted in STELLA. The research shows that E5 blending will be achieved, but it will not meet E10, therefore it is suggested to expanding the cassava cultivation land at least 12.2% per year, starting from 2019 then 5.7% from 2020. But the scenario cannot cover E20 in 2025. Thus the government should expand 2.8 million Ha of cassava land.

Electricity storage plants can provide flexibility to the energy system and the development of new, efficient and economical energy storage technologies is of great importance. In this paper, the use of compressed air energy storage plants in the German electricity market is simulated and a sensitivity analysis is carried out. The optimization of the system is done to minimize at each time step the total system costs. The analysis shows the influence of storage plant parameters such as efficiency, storage capacity and natural gas usage on the dispatch and operation hours. It is performed over one year and for three different future scenarios. The results indicate that utilization of storage plants will increase in each scenario considered from 2025 to 2035 but remains in most cases significantly below the maximum capacity of 3000 h/a power generation. While the operation of storage plants lowers the total electricity cost, earnings per plant and profits are not necessarily positive: the wholesale price signals do not create enough revenues to justify the investment in CAES plants.",IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe,2016.0,1,0,"{'url': 'http://publica.fraunhofer.de/bitstreams/ce92051a-4e85-451c-a82c-51c611518da7/download', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'other-oa', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ISGTEurope.2016.7856246?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGTEurope.2016.7856246, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8cb6da3ea9303c90f6de7b983281fb7c8bdbd6be,Factors affecting peer assessment of student presentations,"In this paper we present some important factors affecting peer assessment of student presentations in a graduate course. The course was titled “Advanced Information Systems” and was offered during the autumn semester of the academic year 2015–16 by the University of Piraeus. The sixty-one postgraduate students taking the course participated in this research. Students cooperated in groups of two or three in order to present a topic selected from a textbook relevant to the material that had already been taught in the class. Participants had to attend their peers' presentations and assess them using a single-page questionnaire. The questionnaire contained 19 closed five-point Likert scale questions plus some demographic questions. This peer assessment was also compared to the instructor's assessment who used the same questionnaire. The research revealed that: a) students' grades span a very narrow range in the grading scale (0–5), i.e., from 3.5 to 4.5; b) male students graded their peers more generously (higher) than female students; c) elder students graded their peers more generously than younger students; d) peer assessment grades did not depend on whether the students had to make a presentation or they had to do a simulation project; e) students who had already presented graded their peers more generously than those who had not presented yet; and finally, f) students gave different grades to the members of each group.",IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference,2017.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942954?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942954, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7de9ebbbb935f8d15462e046c834fe7e66c91ecd,Monthly Rainfall Prediction Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms for Early Warning of Landslide Occurrence,"Landslides are considered to be calamitous natural hazards commonly recurring in the Indian Himalayas. Majority of landslides are induced by prolonged or heavy rainfall. Rainfall forecasting helps in identifying the precipitation conditions responsible for landslide occurrence. The proposed research work provides the performance comparison of various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, back propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR) and long short term memory network (LSTM) used to forecast rainfall which can be compared with the rainfall thresholds to predict landslide occurrence. The analysis is performed using antecedent rainfall data obtained from Narendra Nagar, a small town in the Tehri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand for the period of 1901-2015. Owing to the limited predictability of instantaneous state of the weather, daily rainfall observations are aggregated into monthly indexes. The proposed algorithms use preprocessing techniques followed by data normalization to increase the accuracy of forecasting models. The developed models have the ability to predict rainfall intensity one month in advance or for a specific month of the upcoming year depending upon the dataset used. The study concludes that the BPNNs are able to outperform and provide optimal inferences stating the aptness of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in estimating rainfall and hence predicting the possibility of landslide occurrence well in advance. The study is conducted explicitly for regions highly vulnerable to landslides near Narendra Nagar but may be implemented to any landslide prone area.",2020 International Conference for Emerging Technology (INCET),2020.0,20,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/incet49848.2020.9154184?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/incet49848.2020.9154184, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

90576b259fc8aa44e30f9e353b32f7cd337f2b87,ROSETTA: The Challenge of Escorting a Comet and Landing on Its Surface,"Summary form only given. One of the most interesting places in our solar system was 2014/2015 moving between the orbits of Jupiter and Earth, when the European space probe ROSETTA had a rendezvous with the comet 67 P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. In November 2014 the PHILAE lander separated from the mother spacecraft and landed by a combination of autonomous reactions and remote controls from a distance of 500 Mio km with high accuracy on the surface of the comet. The unconventional landing ended due to actuator malfunctions in a very interesting cliff, where the foreseen measurements were nevertheless well performed. ROSETTA escorted the comet in near distance during the year 2015, including its passage of closest distance to the Sun in order to observe the development of its tail. This way sublimated pristine materials from the core of the comet could be characterized, providing information from the period when our solar system formed. Scientific journals like Science and nature selected the pioneering ROSETTA mission as scientific top event of the year 2014. This presentation addresses the software and control background of this complex and challenging mission, which started about 25 years ago and had to respect ambitious technical as well as international challenges. The fascination of space exploration will be illustrated by pictures from this bizarre comet.",International Conference on Automation and Computing,2016.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICAC.2016.65?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAC.2016.65, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To open up the issue of the degree of interactiveness and agency that different media allow toward the story, we merged knowledge from cultural, media and game studies. Aiming at building brave, fresh interactive narratives for contemporary media (analogue, digital or hybrid), each year we experimented the implications of initiating the design activity from a different starting point: 1) archetypal characters, 2) thick and compelling storyworlds, and 3) real testimonies shaped as short stories and fragments of memories. We discuss the different tools and methods employed, and the reasons why behind their evolution through time.

bccb766f67877a1ca2e80b171ed9d14e4ed5738b,Security Device for Motorcycle Using Smartphone Android with Promini,"According to the theft report received by Indonesian National Police in 2014, 9112 motorcycles were stolen, the number of motorcycle thefts decreased by 43.87% in 2015. And in 2016, motorcycle theft again increased by 1.23% from the previous year. Due to this problem, an alternative solution is needed to improve motorcycle security. One way to improve the security of the motorcycle is to modernize the motorcycle security system from conventional way to high-tech by utilizing the development of information technology (IT). In this study, we explored ATMega328 microcontroller on Arduino Promini board which is controlled using a smartphone with Android platform to build a motorcycle security device. Controls made through the smartphone to activate or to disconnect the electric motorcycle circuit through the relay. We conducted tests to measure the effectiveness and the time required by the device to be active based on different distances. The results of this test indicate that the device took a longer time if it is turned on from a longer distance. As for turning on or off a motorcycle, the device took 0.5 seconds at a minimum distance of 1 meter and took 1.5 seconds at a maximum distance of 15 (fifteen) meters. It is also found that to turn on a motorcycle engine, it took 0.5 seconds at a minimum distance of 1 (one) meter and 3 seconds at a maximum distance of 15 (fifteen) meters, and it took 0.5 seconds at a minimum distance of 1 (one) meter and 4 seconds at a maximum distance of 15 (fifteen) meters. The results obtained shows that the proposed method can be potential motorcycle security as an alternative solution.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2018.0,5,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1028/1/012049', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1742-6596/1028/1/012049?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1028/1/012049, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To facilitate efficient resource allocation and management in cities, in this paper, we study one such important problem: how long does it take to resolve non-emergency 311 service requests? We present NYCER, a Non-emergency Response prediction system based on a recently developed structured regression model, sparse Gaussian conditional random fields (GCRFs), that successfully captures the dependencies between historical and future response times. Through extensive experimentation on 311 service requests in New York City (NYC) over a three and a half year period between Jan 2015 to June 2018, we demonstrate that our trained system is able to accurately predict future response times one week in advance using just the previous two weeks data at test time. NYCER achieves superior prediction performance across all agencies, complaint types, and locations, when compared to a linear regression baseline (up to a factor of 2X). The trained NYCER system requires low computational resources and data at test time, thus making it an attractive system that can be readily deployed in practice.",International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking and Services,2018.0,5,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3286978.3287010?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3286978.3287010, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

26d242228045d5c3db580618ca924ee4b6a9f23f,EURO-CARES - A European Sample Curation Facility for Sample Return Missions,"EURO-CARES (European Curation of Astromaterials Returned from the Exploration of Space) was a three-year multinational project (2015–2017) funded by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 research programme. The objective of EURO-CARES was to create a roadmap for the implementation of a European Extra-terrestrial Sample Curation Facility (ESCF). This facility was intended to be suitable for the curation of samples from return missions from the Moon, asteroids, Mars, and other bodies of the Solar System. The EURO-CARES project covered five technical areas, led by scientists and engineers from institutions across Europe. 1. Planetary Protection: Planetary protection requirements and implementation approaches were assessed by experts and guided by international policy. Existing sterilization methods and techniques were reviewed. It was found that measures already employed for high containment biosafety facilities are suitable for a restricted sample return mission. However, the development of certain technologies, such as a ‘double walled’ isolator, remote manipulation, integration of scientific analytical instruments, etc., is also required. 2. Facilities and Infrastructure: Aspects from building design to storage of the samples were examined in the project. Requirements for the facility included that it contained a receiving laboratory, a cleaning and opening laboratory, a bio-assessment laboratory, a curation laboratory, and sample storage. Different design solutions were prepared in collaboration with architects. 3. Instruments and Methods: The methodology of characterisation of returned samples and the instrument base required at the ESCF were determined. The analyses provide an appropriate level of characterisation while ensuring minimal contamination and minimal alteration of the sample. When the samples are returned to Earth, several stages of studies would be conducted. 4. Analogue Samples: Analogue proxy samples were considered critical for testing sample handling, preparation techniques, storage conditions, planetary protection measures, as well as to validate new analytical methods. A list of useful analogue samples has been assembled. 5. Sample Transport: The Earth re-entry capsule from a sample return mission is targeted at a specific landing ellipse on Earth and must then be transported safely to the ESCF in an appropriate transport container. Lessons learned from past sample return missions show that preparations for recovery included: training of the recovery team for every possible scenario, possible temporary facilities nearby the landing site, environmental measurements and collection of samples at the landing site, added to this if necessary, would be planetary protection measures. In conclusion, long-term curation of extra-terrestrial samples requires that the samples are kept clean to minimize the risk of Earth contaminants, at the same time as contained, in case of a restricted sample return. This work describes a roadmap for a combined high containment and ultraclean European sample curation facility and the development of the necessary novel scientific and engineering methods and techniques.",IEEE Aerospace Conference,2019.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/AERO.2019.8741703?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2019.8741703, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Based on the data provided by an auto finance institution, This paper mainly studies how to analyze the historical loan data of auto financial institutions with the help of the idea of unbalanced data classification, and predicts the possibility of loan default based on Random forest classification model, which provides a reference for the risk control of this institution. Introduction According to the data of China auto industry association, the sales volume of China's auto market in 2015 was 24.597.76 million units, an increase of 4.7% year on year, is the lowest growth rate since 2012. On the contrary, the growth rate of auto finance business has maintained a high level. Relevant data show that in 2014, the size of auto financial market exceeded 700 billion, and the penetration rate of auto finance exceeded 20%. In 2015, the overall size of China's auto financial market was about 800 to 900 billion, and the overall penetration rate was about 35%. Figure 1. Demostic auto market trend Introduction to Credit Risk in Auto Finance At present, in the credit risk management of auto finance companies, subjective judgment is the main way to identify and evaluate the risk, which means based on experience and full of randomness. The basic data used in the model mostly come from the qualitative judgment of credit personnel, which cannot achieve the ideal effect of risk management. In future business operation, in order to improve the technical level of credit risk management, most auto financial institutions willing focus on quantitative indicators, establish a risk control mechanism using loan risk degree model and behavioral scoring model as tools, and use mathematical statistics model to measure and analyze risks, so as to achieve a reasonable offset of risks. Under this context, this paper provides a reference for credit granting of auto financial institutions by data modeling of an auto financial company.","Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Modeling, Analysis, Simulation Technologies and Applications (MASTA 2019)",2019.0,4,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.2991/masta-19.2019.17', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2991/MASTA-19.2019.17?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2991/MASTA-19.2019.17, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

6b8838513d9bf5879e7675380c9c4e5d6c472e4d,Distributed MIMO Cooperative Transmission Technique and Its Performance,"This paper presents a comprehensive introduction of the distributed MIMO cooperative transmission technique which has been developed under the framework of national 5G research & development (4-year project of 2015 2018) funded by Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), Japan. The distributed MIMO cooperative transmission includes single-user space-time block code transmit diversity (STBC-TD), multi-user minimum mean square error (MMSE) based filtering jointly used with eigenmode filtering obtained by singular value decomposition (SVD), called MMSE-SVD in short, and blind selected mapping (blind SLM). The bit error rate (BER), link capacity, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)-complexity tradeoff performances of distributed MIMO cooperative transmission, evaluated by extensive numerical and computer simulation, are presented. Furthermore, the interference coordination techniques, i.e., the user clustering and the decentralized inter-cell (or inter-BS) interference coordination (ICIC), for further improving the area spectrum efficiency and for enhancing the flexible and scalable deployment of distributed MIMO system are also presented.",International Conference on Innovative Computing and Cloud Computing,2019.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICCChina.2019.8855832?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2019.8855832, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2b4f3524f7c31584047353db189c0f2cece8eb72,Correlating Learning Outcomes to the Graduate Attributes of the International Engineering Alliance in a Problem-Based Learning Module,"Problem-based learning has gained recognition around the world as a valid and reliable pedagogy that has the potential to increase student motivation and engagement, promote active and self-directed learning, stimulate collaborative and cooperative learning and foster intrapersonal and interpersonal skills. However, some challenges have been reported with regard to its implementation, such as the requirement of educators to acquire new competencies, the change in assessment strategies and in ensuring adequate coverage of the learning outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to correlate the learning outcomes of a problem-based learning module for first-year African engineering students to the 12 graduate attributes of the International Engineering Alliance. Documentary analysis is primarily used in this qualitative study that is categorized as a non-experimental research design. Student results of using this pedagogy over a two-year period (2015 – 2016) indicate that 85.5% of first-year African engineering students could successfully complete this problem-based learning module. Dominant graduate attributes in this module included engineering knowledge and lifelong learning. However, all 12 graduate attributes are correlated to the six primary learning outcomes in this singular first-year module. This may enable students to be better prepared for further modules in their university career which feature problem-based learning. It is recommended that the learning outcomes in all problem-based learning modules be correlated to the graduate attributes of the International Engineering Alliance using a matrix chart. This will enable engineering accreditation bodies to make an informed decision regarding the standard of an engineering curriculum that is under review.",IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference,2019.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725250?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725250, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The 444 stations were classified according to the average number of input and output bikes using a Pareto chart. The patterns of mobility between the stations are shown graphically; thus, some clusters are identified based on the number of arrivals and departures. Finally, the number of input and output for some stations is plotted in ten-minute intervals for weekdays and weekends. Therefore, it is known the flow of bikes in stations per time interval per day. These patterns are applied to predict the behavior of a particular station to define policies to improve the bike system program.

e9ed32ff1b7a0cac3f968b673da7127eb8728c01,Enhancing the Prediction of Growth of Footballers using Real-Life Statistics and Machine Learning,"Futbol Club Barcelona, more popularly known as FC Barcelona is one of the most successful clubs in the history of football winning the UEFA Champions' league, Europe's premier club competition as well as the biggest club competition in world football, five times and having one of the highest tallies of trophies in the world. The club has also had the highest revenue of all in the world for a few years and is as of now, the most valuable club in the world. But the club is in a debt of $1.6 billion as of 2021. The question naturally arises, what did a club like Barcelona do wrong to meet such fate despite being so commercially successful? Though the pandemic has had a sizable impact on the club's financial wellbeing, the bulk of the blame must go to the horrible transfer record that Barcelona has had since their last UEFA Champions' league triumph in 2015. FC Barcelona has spent a whopping $1.3 billion on transfers alone since June 2015. The signings were supposed to prolong the club's stay at the summit of club football, ironically these have brought the club down significantly. Players like Phillipe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele and Antoine Griezmann who were bought in for a combined fee of $500 million, were supposed to be some of the best in the world, but didn't have remotely good spells at Barcelona. They certainly were world class talents, so why did they barely get into the starting 11 when they should have been the next generation of superstars? Was it pressure, injuries or were they just not the right fit for Barcelona? Though Barcelona is an extreme example, every year dozens of big money transfers fail despite some of the most experienced and smartest brains working on them. Though player potential is immensely important for a player to achieve success, in the end it invariably depends on the playing style of the player and the team. The primary objective of this paper is to leverage analytics to identify players who are the best fit for the teams. The idea is to analyze, and decipher underlying quantitative patterns and make an association that could help identify which players a team should pursue in the transfer market. This can be done by identifying the glaring weaknesses in a team and finding a suitable player which can fill the gaping hole and fit the style of play of said team using real-life statistics of players and teams.",2022 International Conference on Applied Artificial Intelligence and Computing (ICAAIC),2022.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICAAIC53929.2022.9792997?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAAIC53929.2022.9792997, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

056a482b6570fd0d64dc279febb7ed8fd23a1385,Optimal cost-based strategies in mobile network offloading,This article examines potential deployment strategies for mobile operators to satisfy the high anticipated data traffic volume in their mobile networks. The mobile network offloading is analyzed with the traditional evolution of macrocellular radio access networks. Cognitive radio is considered as a technology that may augment these deployment strategies. A duopoly model is developed to examine where and when mobile offloading is likely to happen. The results show how much offloading there will be and the exact conditions when it is profitable based on the estimated cost parameters and the future demands.

The characteristics and necessity of the learning model, and the practical study of the learning model. 1. Domestic Research Status of College English Teaching under the Background of “Internet + education” The reason why “Internet + education” has received domestic attention is based on the congratulatory letter from General Secretary Xi Jinping on May 23, 2015 to the first International education Informatization Conference. ""Proactively promote the integration of information technology and education, and continue to promote education informationization. Informatization as a means to expand the coverage of quality education resources."" In 2016, the Ministry of education issued the ""Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for education Informationization"", which mentioned that ""by 2020, it will be basically built, 'everyone learns, can learn everywhere, can learn from time to time', and is in line with the development goal of national education modernization. education Information System."" In the report of the 19th National Congress, ""Deepening the reform of education and accelerating the modernization of education."" Du Zhanyuan, deputy minister of education, put forward in October 2017 that ""informatization of education will comprehensively promote education modernization, emphasizing that education informatization will bring innovation and teaching of educational concepts a profound revolution in the model."" Information technology is used in various disciplines of basic education and higher education, and the results are fruitful. At present, the application research of “Internet + education” in college English teaching focuses on the following aspects: 1.1 Researches of College English Classroom Based on blended Learning The concept of blended learning was proposed at the beginning of the century in the context of the information age. blended learning can combine a variety of teaching methods and teaching techniques, combining the advantages of classroom teaching and online online learning. Fully mobilize the autonomy and flexibility of students' learning. Ling Wei et al. (2009) explored college English blended learning based on Web2.0 platform; Ma Wulin et al. (2011) conducted research and practice on college English blended learning model; Ma Guoqing (2015) explored micro-curricular-based English mix Learning mode; Lin Yan (2016) through the evaluation of the ""Exploration of College English Teaching Innovation Model"", explores the English teaching mode of colleges and universities from the perspective of blended learning theory. 1.2 Researches on College English Teaching Based on Mobile Learning Alexander Dye defines mobile learning in the article ""Mobile education: a glance at the future"": mobile learning is a learning that can happen anywhere, any place with the help of Internet devices, 2nd International Conference on Humanities Education and Social Sciences (ICHESS 2019) Copyright © 2019, the Authors.

cae8c011cebd649f78bbd8f992c659031c82358d,Security aware routing scheme in Vehicular Adhoc Network,"Road accidents are increasing from years to years. The Ministry for Road Transport and Highways release the Ministry's annual publication “Road Accidents in India-2016”, in 2016 year, 4,80,652 road accidents were recorded. Nearly 1,50,785 persons were killed in 2016 as against 1,46,133 in 2015, while the accident and fatality figures still leave a lot to be desired in the matter of ensuring road safety. There are number of issues in Vehicular Adhoc Network [VANET] like the security, congestion control, decision system etc. Security awareness and protocol management is becoming an important factor in the design of VANET protocols. Because of mobility, it needs the support of scalable routing strategies. VANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. So security in VANET is a emerging area for the researchers now a day. In this paper the secure scheme we discuss, demonstrates the design, simulation and evaluation of security problems of VANET namely security issues, network congestion and routing. The main objective of this research work is to analyze the performance of existing routing protocols ADOV, DSDV, DSR, and TORA in VANET. The proposed design has accomplished the goal to design an efficient secure routing protocol in VANET using two different approaches for the following implementations. A Secure Vehicle Communications Architecture compliant adhoc network model is developed where RSA is used for implementation. A Crypto Security System model is proposed using MD5. The simulation is carried out in network simulator (NS-2.32).",International Conference on Information Security and Cryptology,2018.0,4,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICISC.2018.8399033?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISC.2018.8399033, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

38a200c0f4ac6091b7ba7733f52c4f088c6311f5,A LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for Lightning Flash Prediction within Southern Africa using Historical Time-series Data,"We evaluated the prediction ability of a Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) model to predict short-term lightning flash density within South Africa using historical lightning events. We predicted the lightning flash densities for one-hour, three-hour and 24-hour periods for two areas within Southern Africa using data from the South African Lightning Detection Network. These areas represent a moderate and a high-flash density area. The inputs were (1) historical one-hour lightning density, and (2) a five-day lightning density average for the corresponding period in the previous year. Models were trained using four years of data and predictions were made for every one-hour interval for one-year. Our LSTM model is composed of lx50 network layer, 2x25 layers, 1 dense layer (activation =Leaky ReLU, optimizer =adam). Models were minimized for Mean Square Error (MSE) but evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and MSE. Our models were tested for repeatability by re-running the model for prediction years 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The results showed a combined MAE of 2.87 flashes. $\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$ and combined MSE of 1209 for one-hour predictions. MAE values remained relatively similar but standard deviations of the errors increased with longer forecast periods.

f1fad344cf5a8ba1175dc352229395a8005f2eeb,YourAdvalue: Measuring Advertising Price Dynamics without Bankrupting User Privacy,"The Real Time Bidding (RTB) protocol is by now more than a decade old. During this time, a handful of measurement papers have looked at bidding strategies, personal information flow, and cost of display advertising through RTB. In this paper, we present YourAdvalue, a privacy-preserving tool for displaying to end-users in a simple and intuitive manner their advertising value as seen through RTB. Using YourAdvalue, we measure desktopRTB prices in the wild, and compare them with desktop and mobileRTB prices reported by past work. We present how it estimates ad prices that are encrypted, and how it preserves user privacy while reporting results back to a data-server for analysis. We deployed our system, disseminated its browser extension, and collected data from 200 users, including 12000 ad impressions over 11 months. By analyzing this dataset, we show that desktop RTB prices have grown 4.6x over desktop RTB prices measured in 2013, and 3.8x over mobile RTB prices measured in 2015. We also study how user demographics associate with the intensity of RTB ecosystem tracking, leading to higher ad prices. We find that exchanging data between advertisers and/or data brokers through cookie- syncronization increases the median value of displayed ads by 19%. We also find that female and younger users are more targeted, suffering more tracking (via cookie synchronization) than male or elder users. As a result of this targeting in our dataset, the advertising value (i) of women is 2.4x higher than that of men, (ii) of 25-34 year-olds is 2.5x higher than that of 35-44 year-olds, (iii) is most expensive on weekends and early mornings.",Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems,2022.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3489048.3522629?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3489048.3522629, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c341196fc7ab35ba35f1797d445b7808b133cb69,OG-Miner: An Intelligent Health Tool for Achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in m-Health Environments,"The latest statistics of WHO show that approxi- mately 500, 000 women die worldwide every year - the majority of them residing in developing countries - due to pregnancy related complications. The situation is so grave that UN has set a target of reducing Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) by 75% till the year 2015 in its millennium development goals (MDGs). Therefore, the current focus of health care researchers is to advocate the use of e-health technology in developing countries that have the capability: (1) to remotely monitor patients in their homes by semiskilled health professionals, and (2) to use data mining techniques to raise alarms about high risk patients. In this paper, we develop an intelligent health tool - Obstetrics and Gynaecology (OG) OG-Miner - that presents a novel combination of data mining techniques for accurate and effective classification of high risk pregnant women. The scheme classifies four major risk factors of mortality - hypertension, hemorrhage, septicemia and obstructed labor - in a reliable, autonomous and accurate fashion. We have collected a real world data of more than 1200 patients from tertiary care hospitals and rural areas. Our tool achieves more than 98% accuracy on the collected OG dataset. Moreover, our evaluations of OG-Miner on eight other medical datasets show that its learning paradigm can be generalized to other domains as well. Last but not least, we are using OG-Miner as an integral component of a health value chain in our m-health project to autonomously filter a significant number of low risk patients in rural areas; as a result, only high risk patients are referred to specialized obstetrician in tertiary care hospitals. As a consequence, the reduced workload enables them to provide quality care to the patients.",Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2011.0,16,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/HICSS.2011.320?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2011.320, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d6cf1f6f2800a8946e6f4ae22f57c2361f834fb6,Smart tracking system applied for Lao's museum using RFID technology based on fingerprint technique,"The ASEAN Community is comprised of three pillars, namely the ASEAN Political-Security Community, ASEAN Economic Community and ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. Last year, in December 2015, Laos P.D.R and others 9 ASEAN Countries became The ASEAN Economic Community or AEC. For ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community will be achieved soon. As known, 10 ASEAN Countries have many difference cultures such as Laos P.D.R has more than 49 races and they are different for social and cultures. To learn about all Lao cultures, the museum is a good choice. The smart museum is the museum which can be provided a good information and convenient for the visitors. To provide good information for the visitors, the tracking system is needed. Although there are many tracking systems for 2D indoor localization proposed in recent years, 3D indoor localization is still limited. Therefore, this paper proposed the intelligent system for 3D localization supported visitor tracking in Laos's museum using RFID Technology. The system deployed fingerprint technique and pattern matching algorithm to solve the problem of indoor propagation and to get the high accuracy. According to the result, the average error of the estimated target location is approximately 60 cm which is less than the fingerprint separated distance. In addition, this system can be identified whether the visitors are adult or children by classifying the height of the target location as well leading to support the suitable information (speech, videos, text, etc.,) for them in the future work.","International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology",2016.0,5,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ECTICON.2016.7561480?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICON.2016.7561480, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is necessary to monitor its water quality frequently. But monitoring and assessment of a river WQ is a provocative task in ecological management. In this study, soft computing based one of the computation technique called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to developpredictionor forecasting modelfor estimating the WQ of the river Ganga in the stretch from Devprayag to Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India. Five sampling stations along this river stretch areselected. The monthly data sets of five water quality parameters temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand and total coliform is usedfrom year 2001 to 2015. In developing the ANN model for the WQ prediction, the feed forward error back propagation method is used to develop predictionmodel for conducting various experimental investigationsfollowing many training parameters by adopting the neural network configurationof 5-10-1. The prediction performance of the developed model is evaluated using one of the statistical means named mean square error. The predicted WQ model resulted in a higher accuracy by producing best MSEvalue of 0.041 when using trainlm(Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation)as a training function.

0c9783120842f376db2790e6ec99d8e73595035f,The Honey Bee Initiative — Smart hive,"Bees are an important part of our echo system. Pollinators, such as bees, help at least 30% of the worlds crops and 90% of the worlds wild plans to thrive via cross-pollination. Studies show that between 2015 and 2016 beekeepers lost 44% of bee colonies over the winter, this is up about 10% from the previous decade. Causes for this decline is correlated to the overall hive health. The healthier the hive the more likely it is to survive the winter. Current technology dictates humans check the hives for Varroa Mite infestations, poor moisture levels, and other telling signs of an unhealthy hive. These checks are invasive to the bee colonies and only happen once or twice a year. This projects aims to create a “Smart Hive” that can be monitored from the cloud that will have high resolution (spacial and temporal) data recorded from a variety of sensors to assist beekeepers in keeping their hives healthy. The “Smart Hive” will be added to the George Mason Universities' Honey Bee Initiative's collection of hives. Realtime “Smart Hive” data will be made available to the public, and all systems developed will be made opensource.",International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence,2017.0,5,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/URAI.2017.7992772?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/URAI.2017.7992772, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

253ca3090b42c577aed8e729fe5914260068a385,The Impact on Student Learning and Satisfaction When a CS2 Course Became Interactive (Abstract Only),"From 2013 to 2014, a fairly standard CS2 course was changed to a dynamic classroom using clicker questions and OpenDSA textbook (embedded animations with animated and multiple choice questions allowing instructor review of results). Through these changes, class time focused on conceptual ideas and discussion rather than the mechanics of data structures. The clicker questions were used to engage students by strategically asking questions that differentiated between correct ideas and common misconceptions. To assess these changes, surveys of central CS2013 topics were given to students in 2013 (before the changes) and in 2014 and 2015 (after the changes) where the course is offered each spring. Additionally, the drop rate and knowledge from assignments and exams were examined. The analysis showed that after the first year students showed greater learning gains and substantial decline in drop rate (57% to 27%) but found the course less valuable (class time, discussions and readings). In the second year there was a drop in learning gains, an even greater reduction in drop rate (12%) but students now found the course time more valuable than the first year. These results are attributed to regularly informing students in the third year to the reasons for the new methodologies and the fact that a greater diversity of students completed the course each year.

65d3c15e057533fe7cd6dd3fb4e9be7a8de1b181,Sampling Bias in LinkedIn: A Case Study,"This paper describes a case study of sampling bias in LinkedIn, a major professional social network. The study collected a sample of 1,989 STEM students who graduated from a major public university between 2002 and 2014. Overall, 40\% of the graduates had a LinkedIn profile in summer of 2015. It was observed that LinkedIn participation significantly fluctuated among different majors, and ranged from 30\% for biochemistry majors to 51\% for information science majors. Year of graduation, gender, and grade point average surprisingly did not seem to create a large difference in LinkedIn participation. These results should be useful for design and interpretation of empirical studies which use LinkedIn data or select participants from LinkedIn social network.",The Web Conference,2016.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/2872518.2889357?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2889357, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, in this paper we do not interested with political conversation, how one candidate couples can win or how one candidate couples could lose. We are interested to learn based on our science knowledge in Computer Science perspective particularly with the term of Data Mining with this 5 years DKI Jakarta event program. Hopefully, by reading this paper the students of Computer Science can understand their Computer Science knowledge in their surrounding life events. Obviously, voters' decisions are influenced by human nature characteristic which like to similarity preferences, where human like to choose someone who have full or frequent similarity in profile and/or program. Beforehand, voters should do learning by doing the characterization of their and candidate couples' profile and program. Afterwards, based on candidate couples' profile and program, the voters will do discrimination between candidate couples, classification, clustering or association among candidate couples.

However, many individuals throughout Europe gain employment as technical communicators without undergoing specialized training. TecCOMFrame, a three-year project funded by the European Union, aims to develop: 1) a common academic qualification and competence framework for technical communication; 2) prototypes of technical communication curricula; 3) a competence and qualification profiling tool and an update of the TecDocNet Guideline, which describes professional education and training of technical communicators in Europe. TecCOMFrame is coordinated by tekom Europe and involves academic partners from eight European countries. The project started in September 2015. Partners have worked on the development of the qualification and competence framework, which was finalized and published at the beginning of 2017. Partners are now developing prototype curricula. Throughout the project, partners collect feedback from academics, practitioners and employers in technical communication to ensure that the project results meet the needs of all stakeholders.

bd4d656c7d65864b35d6710a7ade63e597ca9e6d,Incremental Learning Models of Bike Counts at Bike Sharing Systems,"Bike sharing systems (BSSs) have become a convenient and environmentally friendly transportation mode, but may suffer from logistical issues such as bike shortages at stations. Predicting bike counts would help mitigate imbalances in the system. Research has focused on global prediction techniques but has neglected the role of user incentives. We adopted two computational techniques to capture BSS dynamics: mini-batch gradient descent for the linear regression (MBGDLR) and locally weighted regression (LWR). The two approaches used incremental learning based only on the previous status of the station with neither weather nor time information. The models were applied to a BSS data set for one year (2014–2015) in the San Francisco Bay Area for different prediction windows. Both models gave comparable results. LWR performed slightly better than MBGDLR for all prediction windows. The smallest prediction error for LWR was 0.31 bikes/station (4% prediction error) for a 15-minute prediction window and 0.32 bikes/station for MBGDLR. The 120-minute prediction window had the largest prediction error of 1.1 bikes/station and 1.2 bikes/station for LWR and MBGDLR, respectively. Computationally, MBGDLR was 55 times faster than LWR and proved to be faster than other machine learning and time series algorithms.",International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018.0,3,0,"{'url': 'https://eprints.qut.edu.au/124113/2/124113.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569735?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569735, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Based on the annual report of the Information System Program, the percentage of graduates on time has a decrease between the target and the achievement of the study program. From academic year 2014/2015 to 2016/2017, the annual achievement decrease is about 1%. So, it becomes a question, what factors can improve students graduate on time. These factors are reviewed through academic data records. By using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method, we have to weigh the value of that factor. Among them are the GPA of Level 2, the number of repeated courses, the origin of the school, the work of the parents, the income of the parents, the entry point and the amount of TAK the points. The results obtained is the number of repeat courses is the factor with the highest weight in the graduation on time students of Information Systems Program with a highest weight of 0,3492.",2018 6th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management (CITSM),2018.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CITSM.2018.8674334?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CITSM.2018.8674334, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b56394620b0c4ebf90deafcf49de9f9c6f85d2d3,A study on smart mobility in Kuala Lumpur,"Transportation in Malaysia started since the British colonial period and as of 2016, it can be said that the country's transport network is highly diversified having undergone years of development. At present, Malaysia's road network covers an extensive estimate of 230,000 km in 2015 with a national road development growth index of 2.29 from a mere 1.42 in 2010. Since the 10th Malaysia plan, Malaysia's network growth remained at an annual 10.9% growth bringing this to an astounding 68% overall growth as of 2015 and this focus is set to continue in the 11th Malaysia Plan from 2016–2020 leveraging new investments in road, rail and air services. According to statistics obtained from JPJ, the number of new vehicles registrations spiked from 25418 in 2012 to 40753 in the following year and as of 2016, there is an observable average of 8000 to 11000 new registrations per month. By the first quarter of 2016, the number of new registered motor vehicles in Wilayah Persekutuan, Kuala Lumpur obtained from Road Transport Department is reported at 31476 and the total number of vehicles in the state is 6,149,414. Due to the rapid surge in urban transport and the wide availability of mobile vehicles, it becomes necessary to develop a real time monitoring system that could effectively measure the traffic movement of vehicles. This is because vehicles tend to emit unnecessary greenhouse gases which may pollute the environment and affect the population health.

8344ee6f71957808880e9c9809bb1f449268e0bd,The operational impacts in the distribution network from the energy storage management through the reactive PV inverters dispatch in distributed generation systems,"Every year the popularity of the net metering system, for small producers of energy in the Brazilian electric system is increasing fast driven by the Normative Resolutions REN 482/2012 and REN 687/2015 of the National Electricity Agency (ANEEL). These resolutions can encourage investment in the sector and create the growth of renewable energies in the energy matrix through distributed generation (DG). The presence of DG at the distribution systems network can create reverse flows that could increase system power losses when the generation is higher than the load. On de other hand, energy storage systems (ESS), that are present in the intermittent energy sources, like solar generation, are being presented as a solution to various hitches and operating reliability in electric power systems. ESS and its management represent an important factor for efficiency and excellence in electric power systems. Hence, this paper proposes the verification of the operational impacts of DG that uses inverters as interface with the distribution grid from the perspective of reactive injection and in the management of Battery storage systems (BESS) in order to verify the behavior of Power Factor (PF) in the distribution networks and analyze its behavior toward losses, power dispatch and charging at the generation distributed.",International Universities Power Engineering Conference,2017.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/UPEC.2017.8231925?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC.2017.8231925, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b84f23aad29bfc65a367b91e69e70e5279442bfe,The Dilemma and Reform of Accounting Education in Colleges and Universities in the Internet + Era,"""Internet +"" brings innovation and challenge to accounting education nowadays. Accounting educators in Colleges and universities should grasp the pulse of the development of ""Internet +"" in a timely manner, constantly push forward the concept innovation, goal optimization and mode transformation of traditional accounting education, and actively comply with the development trend of the accounting education era. Starting from the current situation and Prospect of accounting education theory in Colleges and universities, this paper analyzes the influence of ""Internet +"" on Accounting Education in Colleges and universities. Secondly, it discusses the realistic predicament of ""Internet +"" accounting education. On this basis, it studies the ways of transformation of accounting education in ""Internet +"" universities, with a view to further promoting the development of accounting education theory in China. In December 2015, the Second World Internet Congress was held in Zhengzhou. During the ""13th Five-Year year"" period, President Xi proposed in Beijing that China will vigorously implement the ""Internet +"" action plan to effectively manage the Internet. In the future, ""Internet +"" will permeate people's learning, life, work and other fields. From the current point of view, the challenge of ""Internet +"" to traditional accounting education is beginning to show. The reform of accounting education in Colleges and universities is imperative. The so-called accounting education refers to the training of the educated in accounting thought, accounting behavior, accounting work and accounting innovation through the teaching of basic accounting theory, basic skills and basic methods. Its core content includes educational idea, educational goal and training mode. In the era of ""Internet +"", the traditional accounting education process exposes many disadvantages. Based on the characteristics of Internet and information management, a new accounting education mode which combines cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things and other intelligent technologies requires undergraduate accounting educators to strengthen the construction of new accounting education mode. Only this way can accounting education conform to the trend of the times and enable the learners of accounting education in Colleges and universities to truly grow up. Therefore, accounting education learners become applied talents with innovative spirit and international vision. 1. The Difficulties Faced By Traditional Accounting Education Model As shown in figure 1, a detailed analysis is presented below. 2019 International Conference on Arts, Management, Education and Innovation (ICAMEI 2019) Published by CSP © 2019 the Authors 226 Figure 1.The Difficulties Faced by Traditional Accounting Education Model 1.1 The Orientation of Educational Objectives is Not Clear Traditional accounting education and teaching starts with the basic accounting equation and uses the basic theory progressive method to upgrade the score theory to the middle and advanced level. But the improvement of theoretical level does not mean the improvement of ability level. Although training accounting talents is the purpose of accounting education, whether it can really meet the needs of the market remains to be verified. There are many colleges and universities at different levels throughout the country, ranging from vocational schools, higher vocational colleges to undergraduate courses, and then to master of accounting. From the point of view of training objectives, there are two main characteristics: one is to train ""comprehensive talents"", that is the combination of good academics of accounting theory and strong practitioners. Second, the target position is inconsistent. Undergraduate and higher vocational education have different training orientations for accounting professionals. 1.2 Unreasonable Course Setting The shortcomings of traditional accounting teaching curriculum are increasingly apparent. Currently, the common curriculum system in Colleges and universities mostly adopts the implementation mode of ore-setting and fixed implementation. This curriculum mode setting may cause students to fail to make a reasonable connection between traditional knowledge and knowledge expansion in the new era of the Internet environment due to the untimely updating of knowledge in the process of education. At the same time, the inherent curriculum system can not make timely adaptations and improvements to the training of professionals according to market changes.The content of accounting course is complicated and its structure is unreasonable. At present, the general accounting course mainly covers basic courses and specialized courses, among which accounting expertise accounts for a large proportion. There are many overlapping and repetitive courses, such as basic accounting and financial accounting, which have obvious overlap in the fields of accounting and statement preparation. This kind of course design will not only make students not interested in the course, but also publicize the subject according to the texts.","2019 International Conference on Arts, Management, Education and Innovation (ICAMEI 2019)",2019.0,1,0,"{'url': 'http://www.clausiuspress.com/conferences/AETP/ICAMEI 2019/XA042.pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.23977/icamei.2019.042?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.23977/icamei.2019.042, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

45d72fc7703e43765ebcd6a3c214dd374eef66f8,Are college algebra students ready to enter an engineering curriculum?,"This Research Category Work in Progress paper examines the success of engineering students who enter Michigan Technological University and start their math sequence at the College Algebra level. At Michigan Tech, all first-year engineering students complete a two or three semester sequence of fundamental engineering courses, based on their first-semester math level. Students starting at the university in Calculus 1 or higher take a two-semester sequence, while students starting at Pre-Calculus take a three-semester sequence of fundamental engineering courses. In fall 2015, first-year students starting their math sequence in College Algebra were allowed to enroll in the three-semester sequence of fundamental engineering courses. Prior to this, these students would “catch up” on their math their first year at the University and would enroll in the two-semester sequence of engineering fundamental courses when they were also ready to take Calculus I at the beginning of their second year. This paper compares the performance of the College Algebra students to the Pre-Calculus students in the first year engineering courses. It was found the College Algebra students were earning statistically significant lower grades in two of three first year engineering courses and had much lower retention rates than the students starting in Pre-Calculus.

bd273fb472819eeb90ddad0c52379fea67177689,The impact of teaching style and FCI gain on the performance in mechanics tests,"The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship, if any, between the gain in the force concept inventory (FCI) and study level, gender, repeaters/non-repeaters, teaching style and the end-of-year mechanics result. The study focussed on all students (N = 395) admitted to a post-secondary institution in Malta in October 2015 and who participated in the pretest and posttest FCI exercise, studying physics at advanced (N = 162) or intermediate level (N = 233). There were 36 students at advanced level and 44 students at intermediate level who did not participate in the posttest FCI. In this study a multiple-choice test was used comprising of 30 questions about mechanics concepts and a questionnaire (by Centre for Occupational Research and Development (CORD)) was given to the lecturers to identify the teaching goals and methods used. The pretest was given on the second week of the academic year, October 2015, so that their response was not influenced by mechanics teaching and the posttest (identical to pretest) was given in the end of the scholastic year, May 2016. The results of the study suggest that only 13.7% of the participants exceeded the average-expected gain of 24%. The gain is higher for males, for participants studying advanced level physics and for participants who were taught by particular lecturers with particular teaching goals and methods. There is a positive correlation between the gain in the FCI and the end-of-year score in mechanics questions about forces and Newton’s laws of motion.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2019.0,1,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1286/1/012007', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1742-6596/1286/1/012007?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1286/1/012007, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

fa909c1d38a88e3541fcfab60fa3fddd445a80a5,Land Cover Change Detection Based on Satellite Images Using Deep Stacking Networks,"Remote sensing provides timely and reliable information about urban areas and their changing patterns. Detection of urban change is an important factor that affects the supply of food supply, water supply, etc. Detection of land use and land change is essential in order to understand the current situation and plan for the future to avoid scarcity. In this work, we proposed two new framework called Tensor - Deep Stacking Network (TDSN) with back propagation and Deep Stacking Convolution Neural Networks (DS - CNN) for land cover change detection. Changes are detected between the year 2005 and 2015 in the month of September over the Hutong area, Beijing, China. The work has been validated by using Sentinel 2 (4 bands cirrus, water vapor, coastal aerosol, red edge band) and Landsat 8(11 bands) satellite image. All the bands from Landsat −8 image are pan-sharpen to 15m resolution to get more accurate classification result. Bands in the Sentinel −2 satellite image are used to remove cloud present in the raw satellite image. The classification accuracy of proposed work are compared with the traditional classification algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Based on the results data in 2015-2019, patient visits to the emergency department tend to increase by around 42% per year. The limited number of beds and medical personnel causes a decrease in productivity and mobility when conducting health services. Therefore, forecasting for patient visit is needed to minimize these problems. This study aims to predict patient visits at the Emergency Department in RSUD Kembangan using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing. Secondary data obtained from April 2015 to June 2019 retrieved from RSUD Kembangan. The results showed that the ARIMA model (1,1,2) was chosen as the best model with MSE 22600.3 and MAPE 10.6 while Exponential Smoothing from Brown showed MSE 26900.6 and MAPE 11.8. ARIMA (1,1,2) has the smallest error size parameter so that a suitable model is applied in forecasting the number of emergency patient visits at RSUD Kembangan in the future.",Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Health,2019.0,1,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.5220/0009590302340239', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5220/0009590302340239?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5220/0009590302340239, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Features constructed based on topics learned using a topic model are very attractive due to their expressiveness in semantic representation and accommodation of inexact matching of semantically related words. We develop a novel general framework for constructing multi-attribute topic features using multi-views of the text data defined according to metadata attributes and study their effectiveness for a text-based prediction task. Furthermore we propose and study multiple weighting strategies to align text-based features and prediction outcomes. We evaluate the proposed method on a Twitter corpus of over 100 million tweets collected over a seven year period in 2009-2015 to predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) new diagnosis and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) new diagnosis in the United States at the zipcode-level and county-level resolutions.

However, the transition from monitoring a process, which today is controlled manually, to automating the process requires a step-change in education of personnel as well as in infrastructure for development and testing new technology. The lack of high quality field data from drilling and well operations is a major problem in research and innovation projects within the oil & gas and geothermal drilling sector, as well as in education within these areas. Since 2015, IRIS and the University of Stavanger have developed a web enabled high fidelity drilling simulator as part of the OpenLab Drilling project1. This paper describes the objectives of the project, the technical solutions of the web enabled drilling simulator, and the results obtained during the first year after deployment to the users.","Proceedings of The 59th Conference on imulation and Modelling (SIMS 59), 26-28 September 2018, Oslo Metropolitan University, Norway",2018.0,2,0,"{'url': 'http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/153/023/ecp18153023.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3384/ECP18153162?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3384/ECP18153162, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To follow the demonstration experimentally, we have built an experimental system. The device is composed of a vibration component corresponding to a building and a cart with a handle corresponding to the ground. They are connected via a linear actuator which can exert one-dimensional force to the vibration component as a function of the input voltage. Students oscillate the cart and observe the motion of the vibration component. In addition, the system has virtual reality cameras to attract students’ interest. The lecture was conducted in 2017. A questionnaire showed that 100% of students valued the lecture as useful. Since 90% of students valued that providing large-scale demonstration and this lecture in combination as useful, the proposed style achieved a certain result.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2018.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658795?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658795, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4c3c2e37326613ee535c51e51ac0534e997408a0,Prediction of Movie Playback Based on Ordinal Support Vector Machine Classification,"This paper aims at predicting the volume of online movie play on an Video On Demand(VOD) platform using movie characteristics together with related social media data collected from the Internet. An ordinal support vector machine classification approach is employed to distinguish movies playback volume levels. This study collected 1,266 online movie data from year 2013 to 2015, and divided it into three types: high, medium, and low, according to view counts. For each movie, the first two months of video broadcasts are collected from the VOD website. Country, movie type, director, actor, box office are collected from professional movie database. Total number of news and tweets of the movies from Baidu and Sina Weibo are crawled to reflect the publicity level of the movie and the attention of the audience. After feature selection and feature creation, the ordinal support vector machine model is used to predict movie view counts with focus on identifying movies with low play counts and high play counts. The empirical results show that our ordinal support vector machine approach has better out-of-sample prediction accuracy, comparing with standard support vector machine models and other classification models.",2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2018.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/BigData.2018.8622468?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData.2018.8622468, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In recent years, a method called multiple sine functions extraction (MSFE) has been proposed, e.g., to predict the potential stock market. In this paper, we use the MSFE to roughly forecast the peak-point of Chinese stock market, in which the inputs are stock data of Shanghai Security Exchange (SSE) Composite Index from 1992 to 2015, and the outputs are potential peak-points of the stock market in the next ten years. Eventually, even though the stock market has cyclical fluctuations, it is corresponding to the rising economy development in China. In addition, we make the conclusion that the peak-point of the Chinese stock market in the next ten years may be around 11/10/2024 in the form of Month/Day/Year.",International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing,2018.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICMLC.2018.8526942?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2018.8526942, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Recently “Fan Out Wafer-level Package” started to be adopted by high-end smart phone AP design, for ultra-thin and excellent interconnect performance. This not only inspires packaging industry, but represents an emerging trend from diversified system requirements to converged package platform, after the 15-year packaging renaissance since wafer-bumping & Flip Chip went to mass-market. In the booming Fan-out package trend, the industry is expanding the horizon of “Fan-out Package” to penetrate into mainstream market. This study will start with the fundamental needs & driving forces for Fan-out Package from end-product requirement, package design perspective, as well as interconnect evolution trend, some basic package formats such as single die, die-2-die, package-on-package, and even Fan-out SiP module integration will also be discussed, together with new process challenges from heterogeneous integration.

This paper presents the study of 61 students' understanding of mathematical creativity of four engineering degrees that were in first year of a northeastern Portuguese university and we analyzed their texts to an open question in a Google Drive Form: “What do you understand by mathematical creativity?” Data collection was done in the first semester of 2014/2015 in the Linear Algebra course. The content analysis of students' answers focused on their texts led to three main categories that were crossed with students' gender, age, degree, and their liking for Mathematics. The results showed that “problem solving” category had the majority of the references, and there were no differences between the proportions of the categories by gender, age or liking mathematics or even independency. This exploratory study leaves clues about the connection that needs to be made between mathematical creativity and solving problems, in order to foster it in Mathematics courses in engineering degrees.",2016 2nd International Conference of the Portuguese Society for Engineering Education (CISPEE),2016.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CISPEE.2016.7777730?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CISPEE.2016.7777730, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

An example from U.S. space vehicles and aircraft parts industries,"Inventory management is in the heart of operational performance in aircraft parts and space vehicles industries. As a result of its importance in practice, this subject has been extensively studied in recent years in operations management. The main focus of this study is to look at the relationship between inventory management performance such as inventory effectiveness, efficiency and responsiveness and company operational performance. A performance model, which includes the different dimensions of aircraft parts and space vehicle industries' inventory management system, has been applied and empirically tested. In order to examine the effect of various measures on inventory performance, the regression analysis has been employed. We use financial data of 39 publicly listed U.S. aircraft parts and space vehicle industries for the 11-year period, 2005 to 2015. The data (Compustat North America Annually Updated) is taken from Standard &Poor's Compustat database via Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS).

e4e11ffbee8a1760d230adb7c247eecd626a1fac,A hybrid forecasting model of cassava price based on artificial neural network with support vector machine technique,"Thailand is the world's largest exporter of cassava. The cassava prices fluctuate because of many factors such as the production cost, economic condition, and price intervention. Therefore, this research aims to propose a forecasting model of cassava price based on the 11-year data (from 2005 to 2015) obtained from the Thai Tapioca Starch Association and Office of Agricultural Economics. Various techniques were applied for the forecast such as Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor and Hybrid Technique. The statistics used to determine the effectiveness of this model were Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The results of this research showed that Hybrid Technique demonstrated the lowest value of error followed by Artificial Neural Network, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine, respectively. Therefore, it could be concluded that using the Hybrid Technique to forecast the price of cassava was better than other techniques and generated the predicted price closest to the actual price.",International Conference on Information Management,2017.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/INFOMAN.2017.7950359?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOMAN.2017.7950359, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

0cf171ab9c97a32f7777775a6a6de56ffa72d445,Design of the CMS upgraded trigger from Phase I to Phase II of the LHC,"The CMS experiment has a sophisticated two-level triggering system composed of the Level-1, instrumented by custom-design hardware boards, and the High Level Trigger, a streamlined version of the offline reconstruction software running on a computer farm (more than 30k CPU cores). In 2017, the LHC delivered proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV with a peak instantaneous luminosity larger than 2 · 10^34 cm−2 s−1, more than twice the peak luminosity reached during Run1 and far larger than the design value. The CMS Level-1 triggerwas upgraded during the end-of-the year technical stop between 2015 and 2016 in order to improve its performance at high luminosity and at large number of simultaneous inelastic collisions per crossing (pile-up). All the electronic boards have been replaced and the upgraded electronics tested and commissioned with data. Smarter, more sophisticated, and innovative algorithms are now the core of the first decision layer of CMS: the upgraded trigger system implements pattern recognition and MVA (Boosted Decision Tree) regression techniques in the trigger boards for pT assignment, pile-up subtraction, and isolation requirements for electrons and tau leptons. In addition, the new global trigger is capable of evaluating complex selection algorithms such as those involving the invariant mass of trigger objects. The High Level Trigger features a trade-off between the offline complexity of the algorithms and the available computing power, and be-tween the selection efficiency the maximum sustainable output rate. The trigger selections used in Run-2 will be presented, ranging from simpler single-object selections to more sophisticated algorithms combining different objects and applying analysis-level reconstruction and selection.This document describes the design and performance of the Phase I trigger and how it influences the path towards the Phase II upgrade necessary for the LHC run at a center-of mass energy of 14 TeV with luminosity of 5 − 7 · 10^34 cm−2 s−1 , corresponding to 140–200 pile-up events. The addition of the tracker information at Level-1 and the enhanced computing resources at HLT will maintain the trigger efficiency at a similar level as the present one.",Proceedings of The 39th International Conference on High Energy Physics — PoS(ICHEP2018),2019.0,0,0,"{'url': 'https://pos.sissa.it/340/199/pdf', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22323/1.340.0199?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22323/1.340.0199, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This analysis sought to identify tendencies in diabetes-related CHIT research from 2010-2015 to help researchers find novel research topics, periodicals, collaborators, and funding agencies and experts and lay consumers to find scholarly information. Six search engines encompassing computer science, engineering, and medicine yielded potential diabetes-related CHIT publications. Abstracts and full texts were screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Information on year, periodical, periodical domain, keywords, author location, author institutions, authors, and funding agencies were collected from included publications. The screening process yielded 1551 publications. Studies were published in a core of twenty periodicals, commonly comprising medicine or technology domains. ""Telemedicine"" was the most frequently used keyword. Harvard University, Dr. Eirik Årsand, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases were the most frequent author institution, author, and funding agency, respectively, associated with publications. This analysis revealed potential for novel research on the sociology and economics of diabetes-related CHIT, among other topics. A lack of collaboration between top authors in the field indicates potential for new, impactful collaborations. Ongoing bibliometric research will be necessary to assess changes in this field.

1390801888d299b614efe4ab346dd55c3b23540d,Identifying the Relationship between Precipitation and Zika Outbreaks in Argentina,"Dengue, Malaria and Zika are vector-borne diseases caused by mosquitoes that carry the parasites that lead to illnesses. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) hundreds of thousands of people around the world die every year due to disease-transmitting mosquitoes [6]. Mosquito outbreaks occur most commonly in warm climates, in areas close to the equator and tropical regions. Female mosquitoes lay their eggs in the ponds and puddles where water accumulates due to rainfall. In 2016, there was a significant spike in the number of dengue cases in Argentina; there were 79,455 cases of dengue reported in 2016 compared to 3250 cases in 2014 and 4774 in 2015 and went back down to the hundreds in 2017 and rose to thousands again in 2018 [1]. Since Dengue and Zika are spread by the same species of mosquito, Aedes aegypti, [2], the goal of this project is to examine whether the spike in dengue cases in 2016 in Argentina also led to a spike in Zika cases. During this study we will determine if there is a correlation between the number of Zika cases and rainfall precipitation levels. For the analysis, we use available Zika data for Argentina obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database [8]. More specifically, we are looking at the number of cases per month at a county level in Argentina. The precipitation data is obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) through the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM) [7]. Just like the Zika data, precipitation data is also on a monthly basis and data is available at a county level. There are existing systems for forecasting the outbreak of vector-borne diseases in various countries and each system looks at a particular factor. For example, the Dengue forecasting MOdel Satellite-based System (D-MOSS) is a system that issues warnings of dengue outbreaks eight months before outbreaks are likely to occur in Vietnam [3]. Another existing early warning system is the Predictive fLUshing Mosquito (PLUM) model. PLUM was developed by Draper Scientists in collaboration with scientists from Boston University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to help predict and decrease outbreaks of dengue fever using observations collected in Singapore, Peru, and Puerto Rico [4]. Our work is inspired by D-MOSS, but instead of including water availability as a component in the prediction and focusing on Vietnam, we are interested in finding out the relationship between Zika outbreaks and precipitation levels in Argentina. The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations aim to address global problems of peace, justice, gender equality, good health and many others [5]. Similar to how D-MOSS targets these UN Sustainability goals [3], our project aspires to bring a similar approach when dealing with the Zika Virus. We will produce a report of our analysis results and visualizations that can be used by beneficiaries in Argentina to help in the efforts of combating and controlling the spread of Zika virus.",2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2019.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006386?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006386, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

On December 1, 2015, Adobe upgraded its animation software and renamed it Animate CC 2015.5, thus drawing a line under Flash technology. Designers and developers can use it to create presentations, applications, and other content that allows users to interact. Flash can include simple animations, video content, complex presentations, and applications. But this time we mainly use it to make a two-dimensional animation. [1] This year, 2019, marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. It has been more than 40 years since the launch of reform and opening-up. Over the past 40 years, China has grown from a relatively backward country where food and clothing are a problem to a prosperous modern China. It can be said that in just 40 years, our great country has gone through a variety of milestones, step by step on the road to pursue their dreams. In order to show the great achievements of the motherland and the changes of people’s lives in the past 40 years, we created a two-dimensional animation. We mainly develop and produce animation by using animation software, combining tween animation technology and animation’s powerful functions, such as frame-by-frame animation rendering, to complete this two-dimensional animation short film.

d6adcb414c24bb78ac81448c86b8a2971cbb4c35,The analysis the use of intelligent electric networks and Smart Grid systems,"Currently, much awareness is paid to the effects of smart grids on efficiency of power systems and energy districts, and the selection of suitable operating modes for equipment for transmitting electric energy. Modern intelligent networks have an impact on ensuring a stable state of power system operation modes, increasing their reliability in operation, and increasing the quality of electric energy. The article analyzes the use of intelligent electrical networks and intelligent network systems in both Western countries and the Russian Federation. Statistical data on electricity consumption and forecast values for this rate of consumption are given. In the future, until 2020-2025, there will be a gradual transition to a new type of electric grid organization - smart grids. The use of electric power systems in conjunction with innovative digital information management systems will significantly change the technical and economic characteristics of future power systems in a positive way. The comparison of technical parameters of traditional and intelligent electric networks, as well as the classification of the main groups of devices controlled (flexible) by AC power transmission systems is carried out. Systems are divided according to the principle of power regulation. Implemented projects of using flexible alternative current transmission system devices in the world are presented. As a result of the analysis, it was found that China is actively developing managed (flexible) AC power transmission systems, with a large amount of investment from the state, the volume of investment is much larger and amounts to about $ 70 billion per year.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2020.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1742-6596/1679/5/052083?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1679/5/052083, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This statistic further indicates that 10 percent of the Sri Lankan total population also has some kind of disability. Sri Lanka suffered three decades of civil war. As a result no of disabled people gradually increased. Most of the civilians disadvantage of getting benefits of ICT during that period. As a result the war ending in 2009, the government strategies for the future were directed more on the Development of the country. Sri Lanka ICT literacy rate was increases 8% in 2005. It was increases up to 40% in 2013. Government focuses to be 75 percent by the year 2015. The motivation behind this research is to overcome disability digital divide in Sri Lanka and facilitate more opportunities for them to enjoy in the digital world. The objective of this study is to propose a Web, Mobile and Computer related ICT model to bridge the disability digital divide gap in Sri Lanka and improve the quality of life of the differently abled community in Sri Lanka. This study involved Literature survey, and many different data gathering techniques mainly group discussions, interviews and site visiting more than 107 samples were interviewed to propose the model. Sri Lankan Participants for this study were inclusive of informal interviews with different communities, different disabled categories and different geographical locations. Study findings were indicated that most of the Sri Lankan differently abled community is not aware and not benefited from globally available modern technologies available for this community. This model is basically proposed based on the initial study has done in phase one to eliminate Disability Digital Divide in Sri Lanka and this paper is a revised model proposed by the same author. This new model includes guidelines to eliminate categories under disability digital divide in Web services, Mobile devises, Computer devises.

0bfb32f95f5edd9a8ccacf4aab30fd13076a5ff0,Coaching program for academic success: Promoting equal opportunities for engineering students,"This paper examines a special Personal-Academic Coaching (PAC) program for promoting students' self-efficacy and academic success, which was developed and implemented in a leading engineering college in Israel located in the northern periphery, and seeking to increase accessibility and equal opportunities to higher education. The PAC program was developed to cater to the students' sources of difficulties while addressing the problem of dropout, particularly in the first year of engineering studies. This new program is based on personal coaching principles, but includes an additional component of imparting tools required for academic success. The coaches are 25 college lecturers who were especially trained for this new coaching program. Two hundred and eleven engineering students who had failed in their first year participated in the research during 2015–2016. Forty-six students participated in the PAC in individual weekly coaching encounters with a lecturer-coach, for one semester. The research investigated the PAC program's contribution to students' learning skills and academic achievements. The research examined the academic achievements of students who participated in the PAC and those who did not, at the end of the first year, and at the end of the following two semesters. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 students to examine their perceptions regarding the PAC program's contribution to their academic success. The research findings show that PAC program contributed to improving academic achievements of students, changing from an unsatisfactory academic status to a solid status that allowed them to continue their engineering studies, thus preventing dropout. The students reflect acknowledgement of the PAC contribution to their academic success in three major areas: improving self-management skills, taking active responsibility for learning, and getting significant emotional support from lecturer-coaches. The Teaching and Learning Center and college management find these contributions to be of the utmost importance and provide reason to allocate resources to additional programs for promoting equal opportunities and advancing students from diverse backgrounds in the periphery. PAC can be adapted to other inclusion purposes in academic institutions.",IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference,2018.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363363?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363363, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ab965e41180b2c6138ef97d24770284a445a37a7,Sustainable Educational Innovation Through Engaged Pedagogy and Organizational Change,"This Research-to-Practice Work-in-Progress Paper presents a midway report on a change initiative underway in the College of Computing and Informatics (CCI) at UNC Charlotte. Comprised of approximately 100 faculty members and nearing 2,000 undergraduate majors, CCI was awarded a 5-year, $2 million grant from the National Science Foundation in 2015 to revolutionize computer science education at the collegiate level. This initiative, which seeks to simultaneously achieve both pedagogical and organizational change, is built upon a foundation of educational innovation through engaged teaching practices. To sustain educational innovation in CCI beyond the funded scope of the project, pedagogical change is thus strategically embedded in CCI's organizational structure through a 3-stage model of faculty adoption, redesigned student course evaluations, and realigned values in the reappointment, promotion, and tenure process. By recognizing that sustained organizational change takes root when there is concurrent buy-in from organizational members—both bottom-up and top-down— this reform initiative seeks to embed two-pronged change not only via educational innovation (pedagogical change), but also in the day-to-day practices, policies, and physical environment of the College itself (organizational change).",Frontiers in Education Conference,2018.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658491?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658491, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c94f2e26b6cc0e384e1d59cf3951c33ffd80b320,Diversity and Evolution Trend of Protein Types of Human Influenza A (H1N1) Virus HA Segment,"The Influenza A virus is prone to mutation and the ongoing research on its evolution is of great significance to its prevention and control. The WHO did not update the recommended vaccine after A/California/07/2009 was recommended as the vaccine strain, but the virus has been mutating. This paper proposes an Integrated-Clustering-Analysis (ICA) model to study the distribution and evolution of the influenza A (H1N1) virus. We discover the following interesting facts. Every year there is one major type of virus sequences, the number of which is the overwhelming majority of all sequences. Viral sequences after 2009 undergo cumulative changes as they deviate from the viral vaccine strain over time. According to the drift rate, the evolution process can be divided into three stages. The first stage is a high-speed mutation period from 2009 to 2011. In the second stage, from 2012 to 2014, the mutation speed drops continuously and keeps at a low level. The third stage, from 2015 to 2017, the mutation speed starts with a year jump and follows by two years trough. It seems that the evolution of the influenza A virus has a three years cycle, so we cautiously guess that the drift rate in 2018 would jump up again. The ICA model proposed in this paper can intuitively observe the process of virus type change.",2018 IEEE 20th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 16th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 4th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),2018.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00273?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00273, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

27a74cfe2b6e55d96ad2a74236458e5830738229,A Proposed Crowdsourcing Engine for Indonesian Cultural Heritage,"Indonesia is rich in cultural heritage. Based on BPS data in 2015, there were 6238 intangible and 1413 tangible cultural heritage [1]. Ironically with this great wealth, the 2014 Podes survey shows that Indonesian participation in cultural visits and cultural performances is very low (5-15%) [2]. So it is not surprising that about 127 of Indonesian intangible cultural heritage are on the verge of extinction, one of which is the result of the low level of cultural socialization among the community. Cultural socialization can actually be done through internet media considering that the public's exposure to devices and the internet is increasing year by year[3]. However, the cultural data available on the internet has not been integrated so that it cannot be optimally utilized. Data on cultural heritage is currently spread to many parties: cultural institutions such as museums; cultural community; and individuals. Data on cultural heritage in individuals are prone to be lost if it is not stored and/or inherited. The problem is, how to collect data that is spread everywhere and then store it in a structure that can answer questions such as the number of cultures that exist, statistics, cultural distribution regarding geographical location, and kinship relations between one culture and another. Facing this problem, crowdsourcing is a solution opportunity that allows data collection from many parties. Crowdsourcing is a new way of utilizing human resources spread throughout the world to do certain jobs. The low-quality problem of crowdsourcing technology can be handled by combining crowdsourcing systems with automatic classification algorithms or with procedure or algorithm to select the appropriate worker due to their performance. In this study, a crowdsourcing machine will be built to collect heritage cultural data from various sources. The collected data is stored in an ontology format that can answer questions: statistics on cultural data, number of current cultures, geographical distribution of cultural objects, and intercultural kinship.",International Conference on Intelligent Computing,2018.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IAC.2018.8780481?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IAC.2018.8780481, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

When it comes to sentiment analysis competitions and shared tasks, this is the most popular to date with more than 40 teams participating each year from its inception in 2013. Only subtask B (Message Polarity Classification) was considered under main task (task 10) in this model, as it was a return from previous years and remained highly challenging and competitive among teams from around the world. The proposed model performed exceedingly well, notably getting best results (1st) against 2015 test set, 2nd best results for evaluations against 2013 and 2014 test sets. We performed evaluation using both constrained and unconstrained data under two major classification techniques, single classifier based approach and ensemble approach. For single classifier based approach, classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, Logistic regression, BayesNet and Artificial Neural Networks and for ensemble approach algorithms such as Bagging, Ada Boosting, Random forest and Voting techniques were used.

ffbd8c4db1c8aa5f193afd12e1c3bf854d847c6d,The impact of supervised homework sessions and SAT-Math scores on academic performance in an advanced undergraduate course,"Ancillary learning opportunities outside the classroom take different forms such as peer-led team learning (PLTL) and supplemental instruction (SI). To gain the benefits of ancillary sessions with less overhead than PLTL and SI, we facilitated optional weekly supervised homework sessions for AAE 35200, an aerospace structural mechanics course for third year engineering students at Purdue University. In these sessions, a graduate teaching assistant used the assigned homework problems to demonstrate key concepts on structural mechanics. In order to understand the attributes of the participants, a survey was administered. Also, session attendance was recorded and compared against the exam and homework results. Based on the collected data during the Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 semesters, we have reached the following conclusions: a) attending the supervised homework sessions does not significantly affect the exam score, whereas the opposite is true for the homework scores and b) SAT-Math scores do not seem to have a strong influence on both the exam and homework scores.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2016.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757431?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757431, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

One third of the accidents happened in the manufacturing industry, of which the steel manufacturing industry is a part. Steel industry employees are undoubtedly working in an extremely vulnerable environment. Therefore, it is important to improve workers' safety. Predicting accidents may be one solution for managers to understand the dangers ahead of time, so that they can implement protective actions. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is a widely used method for prediction. It has been used in many areas and objectives. In this study, we use an ANNs model to predict whether an operator in the steel industry will encounter an accident. The prediction factor is the score from safety climate questionnaire, which is an easy way to assess the safety of the organization. The results showed that the prediction accuracy is 61.72%.

d6a429f819869875cbd57a1c21ea16863fce24c7,Data acquisition and signal processing on FMCW navigation radar system,"Data acquisition and Signal Processing is an important part of frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar system. In recent year P2ET-LIPI was developing FMCW navigation radar system in portable size. The main component of data acquisition for navigation radar is highspeed Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) USB-2020 board and signal processing algorithm has been developed using Visual C# 2015 Community Edition. USB-2020 board has two channel ADC on board with 12 bits resolution and operated in a burst-io mode to get maximum sampling rate at 20 MS/s. A timing generator for synchronization between ADC and linear frequency modulation (LFM) chirp generator is developed using Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) Max II series based on VHSIC hardware description language (VHDL). Signal processing unit consists of windowing function to reduce side- lobe suppression, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) function to get range information and adaptive threshold using three algorithms of Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR): Cell Averaging (CA), Order Statistic (OS) and Variable Index (VI) CFAR. The experiment shows that the data acquisition module can capture In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) beat signal and signal processing algorithm can detect object/target from the noise.","2017 International Conference on Radar, Antenna, Microwave, Electronics, and Telecommunications (ICRAMET)",2017.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICRAMET.2017.8253143?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRAMET.2017.8253143, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7918df8fcdf0b0d50f463a8f9aecea0ba0c86189,Potential implementation of subject areas in Malaysia's research assessment Co-word analysis study,"In the education environment, subject area is one of important matter since primary school to higher learning institution. Subject area exists in other developed countries for research assessment. But, apparently, some of country didn't apply the subject area in its research assessment's framework. It is important to have the subject area in the assessment's framework in order to know the development and progress of subject area. Therefore, in this study, one of mechanism used to produce potential subject area is by manipulated selected bibliometric element which called as co-words analysis. This study is focused on 20 year time span started from 1995 and 2015 for Malaysian's researcher's publication. All data were extracted from selected database, Scopus. In Scopus, data were sorted from the highest cited publication. We used a powerful tool namely as Vosviewer to help us to extract the occurrence and potential words that hidden in publication. As a result, our result produced 7 clusters of potential subject area. In this study, we performed correlation analysis between our clusters with selected ranking in order to relationship between these two variable. The analysis results gave us a valuable information that there are potential to implement the subject area in the assessment. Another valuable information from our result is the potential to combine two method in assess the assessment, which is by using the bibliometric element with human judgement. The details for our research were divided into sections.","2017 IEEE Conference on e-Learning, e-Management and e-Services (IC3e)",2017.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IC3E.2017.8409244?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IC3E.2017.8409244, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

2693b8eb443ecd1859968003a5363f36ef26095d,Engineers’ imaginaries of “the public”: Content analysis of reader reactions to an environmental injustice controversy,"This full research paper presents an analysis of 43 engineers’ responses to a 2015 newspaper article about a conflict in St. Rose, LA between affected residents, governmental agencies, and industry representatives concerning potential environmental contamination from a local chemical plant. The article contains conflicting points of view about the facts of the case, leaving readers with no clear sense for which party might be “right.” In reading it, research participants were faced with contradictory information about air monitoring data and the potential health risks involved. While residents reported that data showed clear exceedance of federal air quality standards and that toxic air emissions were causing them widespread and severe health problems, governmental agencies and industry representatives argued that federal limits were being met and that data confirmed the absence of a public health concern. Interview participants included first-year and senior undergraduate students, engineering faculty, and engineering professionals with at least five years of work experience outside academia. Each participant was asked to read the article, share their initial reactions, and discuss what they would recommend as “next steps” in the conflict. Interview recordings were transcribed and analyzed by two reviewers, using emergent thematic coding. Analysis of participant responses showed two main reactions. The first was that residents’ reported health experiences must have been true and that the community’s association of these experiences with industrial air emissions, at the very least, deserved attention. This position tended to be accompanied by efforts on the part of participants to reconcile conflicting information from governmental agencies and industry representatives. The second was that the governmental and industry interpretations of the monitoring data must have been correct and that the community’s reported experiences and/or interpretations must have been at least to some degree invalid. This position tended to be accompanied by efforts on the part of participants to reconcile conflicting information from the residents. Participants’ responses to the article required at least partial reliance on their ‘gut feeling’ about the likely intent, mindset, and conduct of affected communities in environmental injustice controversies. We thus treated their responses as a ‘window’ into engineers’ imaginaries of “the public” and drew on the theoretical lens of ‘social imaginaries’ to analyze dominant emergent themes. The paper closes with a discussion about the potential implications of our findings for engineers as well as for the diverse publics that engineers aim to serve.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2018.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659220?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659220, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

963461f17da0bfaba292ccd746c9766d2db51c7b,Remote Diagnosis of Solar Panel Performance: A Case Study of the Filibaba Energy Kiosk,"This paper describes a statistics-based investigation of the long-term power production of solar panels installed in September 2015 in an energy kiosk in Filibaba, Zambia. The panels power a centralized energy kiosk, which in turn is used for powering personal electronic devices, homes, and businesses. As with any off-grid system, faults and normal or accelerated degradation can reduce the power produced by the solar panels over time. The motivation of this work is to determine if the condition of the solar panels can be assessed remotely, using limited measured data. This can save the time and expense of sending technicians to the site to diagnose or troubleshoot the system. The methods discussed in this paper utilize a data set of the solar panel production and energy kiosk battery voltage. The methods include: comparing solar power output on days that could be expected to have similar weather and sun exposure; analysis of the consistency of power output as it relates to time of year; and using the battery voltage to find times of day for full power output of the panels. Preliminary results show that for the Filibaba energy kiosk, there is, on average, as much as a 34% decrease in power output from one year to the next. Given the age of the panels, these results prompt more analysis to determine if this is indicative of accelerated degradation. The work outlined in this paper will be used to further develop systems for remotely diagnosing issues that may cause decreased panel performance.",IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference,2018.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/GHTC.2018.8601648?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/GHTC.2018.8601648, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These challenges include scheduling, load flow analysis, planning and control of electric energy system. To address this problem, accurate models for electric power load forecasting are essential to the operation and planning of utility companies. The study used a data from the Ashanti East and Ashanti West Regions of the Electricity Company of Ghana. The data is a daily peak load for the whole year of 2014, 2015 and the first month of 2016 with a total of 752 samples. In this study three Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) with layered architecture models (RNN-1–10-1, RNN-1–15-1 and RNN-1–20-1) were developed to forecast the peak electricity load.

A website to raise interest in a STEM future through Internet speech controlled robots.,"This Research to Practice Work in Progress paper reports on a project to interest children in STEM subjects (and later on, hopefully to encourage them to enroll in engineering and science programs). Initially (in 2014) the project used proprietary technology (Microsoft Xbox/Kinect). In 2015, Internet-based but region-limited technologies were tested (Google speech recognition API). In 2017 it changed to its current form, a website using the Annyang JavaScript speech recognition library. The site allows children (and others) to program robots through speech commands, or by clicking buttons. Once finished, the commands are sent by email to the university that has the robot. There, the robot actions are videotaped and uploaded to YouTube or its Chinese equivalent Youku. This will allow for a future scenario where a 7-year-old tells his/her friends “Yesterday, I programmed a robot in China.

The core issue of food security was whatever the food production could meet the food demand of resident population in a region. Per capita grain possession directly reflected the relationship of food supply and demand. In order to analyze food security situation and put forward proposals to Chinese sustainable agricultural development, this study aims to determine how the spatial-temporal distribution of per capita grain possession changed in counties of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2011 to 2015. According to Chinese situation and the per capita nutrition standardization published by FAO, 400kg food was the per capita food consumption meeting nutritional requirements per year. According to this standard, if per capita grain possession per year reached 400kg in a region, this region was considered food security region. In this study, the per capita grain possession of counties was calculated in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2011 to 2015, and the map of per capita grain possession of counties from 2011 to 2015 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei was drawn to show the spatial-temporal changes of food security. Using gravity center method, the spatial gravity center of per capita grain possession from 2011 to 2015 were calculated, and the map of moving path of gravity center was drawn to research the spatial-temporal changes of per capita grain possession.

8ec7b55c6fad29ed363650d926e147a1dff2777b,Inverting VARK what are the possibilities?,"Systems Analysis and Design, a second year subject offered as two modules is offered as part of the Information Technology course at the North-West University's Vaal Triangle Campus. Being sensitive to the learning preferences of the learners, varied opportunities for learners to learn have been developed over a period of time. These include visual, auditory, reading-and-writing, learn-by-doing (VARK), or a combination of these. Although teaching during the second module uses inverted instruction, the first module uses conventional teaching methods. Learners still struggling with particular concepts after a class, have a repertoire of material to choose from to facilitate understanding. Since 2015, the first half of the offering was split into two classes to accommodate new enrollments and repeating learners separately. The offering for repeaters requires learners to prepare for weekly interactive classes. In doing so, they may attend the conventional class. They also have access to a wide variety of material and tools to support their learning, done in their own time. To support the inverted VARK notion, the repeating learners are intentionally made aware of their learning preference. Towards the end of the module offering, these learners have an opportunity to reflect on the new experience compared to their original experience as new enrollments during a previous year, their learning preference, and their learning. At the end of the year they reminisce on the experience by answering a questionnaire.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2017.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2017.8190617?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2017.8190617, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Each and every year students need to renew their visa, to extend their studentship in order to stay in a particular country. In Malaysia, in order to process visa renewal faster, Education Malaysia Global System (EMGS) was introduced by Malaysian Government. Since the implementation of EMGS in April 2015 at International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), however renewal process has become complex and lengthy. As a result, many international students faced difficulties in visa application which cost lot of money, time and resources.

The network was first established in 2005 as a trial network of three (and later four) film camera observatories, which had immediate success with the successful recovery of meteorites in 2008 and 2010. The network was re-established in 2012 as a network of digital fireball observatories, and now comprises over 50 observatories with an observable area over 2.5 million square kilometres. The new digital network was validated at the very end of 2015, with the successful recovery of the Murrili meteorite from Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre in South Australia. This paper describes the design of the observatories and network, and outlines a semi-automated data pipeline which handles nearly a petabyte of data per year.","International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision",2016.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICARCV.2016.7838631?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARCV.2016.7838631, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e8f73a813a014add30d8d448476f656b67b0b044,Statistical analysis of hotel plan popularity in regional tourist areas,"The tourism industry admitted by World Tourism Organization is one of the greatest growth industry. In Japan, this industry has big influence for economics, employments and regional activations. In 2003, Japanese government regarded own country as tourism country and has been doing various policies to makes Japan tourism country. According to the statistical data from home page of Japan Tourism Agency, the number of foreign tourists visiting Japan reached 24.04 million in 2016, marking a 21.8% increase over the previous record of 19.74 million set in 2015 and setting a new record high for a fourth consecutive year. Against this backdrop, the national average guest room occupancy rate of lodging facilities in Japan was 60.0% in 2016. However, it is noteworthy that a major disparity in guest room occupancy rates has occurred between urban areas and regional areas. The guest room occupancy rates in Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture were 79.4% and 84.1%, respectively, whereas in ten prefectures, they were below 50%, with Nagano Prefecture having the lowest rate: 35.5%. In these circumstances, regional tourism promotion is essential for implementing the Japanese government's regional revitalization policies. Accordingly, in the present study, for the purpose of considering the increase of guest room occupancy rates of the lodging facilities in regional areas, we performed analysis of the popularity of hotel plans in Yamanashi Prefecture, which is located near Tokyo, and in Okinawa Prefecture, where the number of tourists from overseas has increased in recent years. To ascertain hotel plan options, we used morphological analysis of plan names. And We created plan groups by cluster analysis. We defined the purchase rate as an indicator for measuring hotel plan popularity. For the purpose of ascertaining hotel plan popularity, we use multiple regression analysis. As a result, we obtained new knowledge about hotel plan popularity.",2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2017.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/BigData.2017.8258451?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData.2017.8258451, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

High-resolution retinal prostheses require precise activation of retinal cells to elicit a small visual phosphine that can serve as a building block to make patterns. Each electrode should activate only nearby cells, however patients receiving single electrode stimulation often report a streak-shaped phosphene rather than a focal spot. It is important to investigate stimulus paradigms that will provide better control over the spatial patterns of activation. During this study a 55 year old patient implanted with the Argus II system on August 2015 was tested with single electrode stimulation and pattern stimulation experiments. Tasks were performed using Argus II normal parameters.",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2017.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037038?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037038, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The Symposium was held the first time last year in 2015 and this is the second edition. It is a forum for researchers, students and practitioners to explore the solution space to address the above challenges. W.K. Chan, Xiaodong Liu, and Hridesh Rajan are pleased to serve as the program chair of SETA this year. SETA received the lion share of submissions submitted to COMPSAC 2016. It received 93 submissions in total. All submissions were reviewed through a double-blinded review process. Each submissions was reviewed by at least three program committee members, and some submissions have received up to four reviews. It was worth noting that some reviews were very comprehensive and contained more than a thousand words. Although length of text was not a strong indicator of review quality, yet it showed that the reviewers were serious and provided invaluable feedbacks to the authors on their work. After the submissions review period, for each submission, there was a period for online discussion among program committee members who reviewed that submission before the physical program committee meeting held in Tokyo on 19−20 February 2016. In the program committee meeting, the summary of the reviews of the submissions was presented in turn, and the program committee members in the meeting as a whole made the decision of acceptance submission by submission. As a result, in the program committee meeting, 18 submissions were accepted as regular papers, representing an acceptance rate of 19.4%, and some 20 submissions were accepted as short papers. One accepted regular paper and two short papers were withdrawn before the symposium was held. For submissions that we could not be included in SETA 2016, the program chairs recommended some of them to venues such as the workshops and the fast abstract track of COMPSAC 2016 for further consideration. SETA has solicited a journal special issue from the Journal of Systems and Software. Finally, we deeply appreciate the invaluable help and guidance by the program committee members of SETA as well as the Organizers of COMPSAC 2016.

494da9be0b54a18b94117ec04293d42478286722,Implementation of bridge modeling competition in evaluating the students competency,"Students' skills and competency serve as a vital requirement that can contribute to their marketability. It can be directly formed in lectures or indirectly through exposure and competition students engaged in. To build and nurture the skills and competency of the students in the Civil and Structural Engineering Department, a bridge model competition was carried out in Semester 1 for Session 2014/2015. The bridge model competition among the First Year students has become the initial platform for lecturers to assess students' competency. Two courses namely LMCK 1331 Effective Communication and LMCK 1531 Leadership and Creativity were assessed in this competition. From this competition, all students need to apply and integrate their knowledge learned from various courses either at the matriculation level or at the university level. Students' preparation and discussion in groups either during training or competition day indirectly can increase their communication skills and spirit of cooperation among themselves. At the end of the competition, students are required to produce a report, present and test the bridge model. The performances of the students were evaluated using specific rubrics. Through the evaluation carried out during the competition, it was found that students have successfully showed their creativity in constructing and presenting the bridge model. Overall, eighty eight percent of the students obtained A grade, ten percent A-grade and 2 percent with E grade in both courses.",IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference,2016.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474693?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474693, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

e8f73a813a014add30d8d448476f656b67b0b044,Statistical analysis of hotel plan popularity in regional tourist areas,"The tourism industry admitted by World Tourism Organization is one of the greatest growth industry. In Japan, this industry has big influence for economics, employments and regional activations. In 2003, Japanese government regarded own country as tourism country and has been doing various policies to makes Japan tourism country. According to the statistical data from home page of Japan Tourism Agency, the number of foreign tourists visiting Japan reached 24.04 million in 2016, marking a 21.8% increase over the previous record of 19.74 million set in 2015 and setting a new record high for a fourth consecutive year. Against this backdrop, the national average guest room occupancy rate of lodging facilities in Japan was 60.0% in 2016. However, it is noteworthy that a major disparity in guest room occupancy rates has occurred between urban areas and regional areas. The guest room occupancy rates in Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture were 79.4% and 84.1%, respectively, whereas in ten prefectures, they were below 50%, with Nagano Prefecture having the lowest rate: 35.5%. In these circumstances, regional tourism promotion is essential for implementing the Japanese government's regional revitalization policies. Accordingly, in the present study, for the purpose of considering the increase of guest room occupancy rates of the lodging facilities in regional areas, we performed analysis of the popularity of hotel plans in Yamanashi Prefecture, which is located near Tokyo, and in Okinawa Prefecture, where the number of tourists from overseas has increased in recent years. To ascertain hotel plan options, we used morphological analysis of plan names. And We created plan groups by cluster analysis. We defined the purchase rate as an indicator for measuring hotel plan popularity. For the purpose of ascertaining hotel plan popularity, we use multiple regression analysis. As a result, we obtained new knowledge about hotel plan popularity.",2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2017.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/BigData.2017.8258451?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData.2017.8258451, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d7f3d7ca205cc1b4a56977decaca998f7f1e773a,Infusing Cooperative Learning into AP Computer Science Principles Courses to Promote Engagement and Diversity,"The Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) course was the culmination of an eight-year NSF/College Board pilot project that exceeded all expectations in terms of enrollment in its first two official years. Four NSF-sponsored projects and six other projects have endorsed AP CSP curricula and professional development (PD), a first for an AP course. In this paper, we report on an NSF-sponsored multi-year effort to infuse cooperative learning (CL) structures into AP CSP classrooms to improve class participation and student learning. As we report, CL structures have been beneficial for both new and experienced teachers and across the curricula of the endorsed providers. Since AP CSP was designed to engage all learners, the CL structures used in our PD workshops and the CL resources designed by participating teachers in our project have the potential to positively impact all AP CSP classrooms. Research was conducted on the extent to which use of CL structures impacted student efficacy and student achievement. Three cohorts of AP CSP teachers participated in PD that focused on AP CSP pedagogical content knowledge using CL structures. A cumulative 143 teachers attended one-week PD workshops spanning July 2015, 2016, and 2017. We studied the effect of CL structures on student learning using AP scores as an outcomes measure. Use of CL structures was a statistically significant and positive predictor of student AP scores for participating classes in cohorts 2 and 3.

A relatively new regrasp planning method is by throwing and catching objects, which cannot be considered as a quasi-static problem due to its high dynamism influenced by the gravity, impact forces, air resistance, friction, etc., and thus has rarely been researched. In this paper, rehttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/worldnews/11318730/New-Year-2015-in-pictures-Fireworks-and-celebrations-around-the-world.html?frame=3152146grasp planning is performed through throwing and catching of various objects by a five-fingered anthropomorphic hand attached to a PUMA 560 manipulator. The planner uses an MLP neural network for learning from past throwing and catching experiences of objects with 9 different geometries. For the test set, five distinct objects with different geometries, densities, and center of mass were designed and tested. Experimental results of throwing and catching these objects showed that the minimum and maximum number of throws for successful catching was either 2 or 3, among which three objects needed just 2 tries (throws) thanks to the correct prediction of the implemented neural network.",International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics,2014.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICROM.2014.6990945?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICROM.2014.6990945, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ae0b1c9b00f946b7e2a9d2c760b50fbb4072af55,The influence of big data and informatization on tourism industry,"From the beginning of the new century, modern society gradually steps into the era of big data and information big bang with the popularity of computers and the Internet. Tourism industry is an important part of China's national economy, and some provinces and cities have been taking it as a pillar industry, a key industry and a pilot industry [1]. With people's income and consumption level being increasing, travel has become one of the important consumption components for most people. Despite the rapid development of tourism, the traditional tourism industry has been unable to meet the growing material and cultural needs of our people. And the use of big data and informatization in the tourism industry brings it a robust and healthy development. The corresponding policies also come into being. China National Tourism Administration proposed in 2011 we shall strive to achieve a comprehensive informatization and modernization of China's tourism industry within about 10 years. The year 2014 is assigned as “Year of China Intelligent Tourism”. China's tourism work conference in 2015 proposed that tourism should fully be integrated into the Internet age and China tourism industry should be armed with information technology. This has been taken as one of the top ten key tasks in “515 strategy” to be deploied. China put forward the “integration, application, security, security”, i.e. the “eight-character” policy, in the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan period, as China's tourism information of the main task.

Now the age of Information Revolution based on intelligence has arrived. In this critical period, the completion of the digital process in the energy sector, the realization of the Information revolution, will directly affect the development of the energy sector Information revolution. The power grid is the basic platform of energy development and utilization, and the State Grid enterprises assume the important social responsibility. Through the construction of the power grid, the Internet of things will be integrated into the digital economy, complete the ""Made in China 2025"" and welcome the arrival of the ""Industry 4.0"". 1. The role of industrial revolution in China In the history of the development of modern human society, there have been three industrial revolutions, each revolution will push the human society to a new height of development. Of course, the world's Lion China also benefited from the rapid development The widespread use of Watt's steam engine in Britain in the 1860s also had an indirect impact on China as it opened its doors to the world and learned advanced science and technology from the West. The development of the Self-Strengthening Movement, the dispatch of foreign students, the establishment of new schools, the planning of coastal defense, the establishment of Jiangnan Machinery Manufacturing Bureau, the rise of various types of enterprises in China, and so on, lead to the development of isolationism China. This industrial technology revolution is known as ""Industry 1.0"" and it was the age of the steam engine [1]. From the 1960s to the early 20th century, electricity replaced steam as an important energy source, marking the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution. At this time, China's domestic and foreign troubles, world capitalism began to develop from liberal capitalism to monopoly capitalism. Imperialist aggression against China shifted from the production of goods to the production of capital, controlling the lifeblood of China's economy. This era is known as ""industry 2.0"" and it is the age of electrification [1]. The third new scientific and technological revolution came in the middle of the 20th century. Represented by the application of atomic energy technology, space technology and computer technology, major breakthroughs have been made in scientific theory and scientific and technological innovation, accelerating the development of the world economy. This is both an opportunity and a challenge for China. With China's reform and opening up, it adjusted the direction of development in time, caught up with the trend of the times, so that China's economy began to take off. This era is known as ""industry 3.0"" [1]. At present, the technological revolution based on artificial intelligence, clean energy, robotics, quantum information technology, virtual reality and biotechnology is rising quietly Known as the ""Industry 4.0, "" this is an era of intelligence in which information technology is used to transform industries, and its arrival will dramatically alter existing modes of production and living. In April 2013, at the German Hannover Messe, the German government officially launched the concept of ""Industry 4.0"" to speed up the process of intellectualization and increase its competitiveness worldwide. In March 2015, Premier Li Keqiang presented the first ""Made in China 2025"" grand plan in the NPC'S report on the work of the government. The ""Made in China 2025"" proposed an innovation-driven, green development, structural optimization and talent-oriented Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 109 International Conference on Economic Management and Cultural Industry (ICEMCI 2019) Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The influence of industrial revolution on China's electric power industry Since the mid-1980s, China's power system has undergone three major reforms. The first is reform of the investment system. From relying solely on government investment to introducing foreign investment, encouraging private capital to invest in power construction, solving the problem of power construction funds, has greatly promoted the development of power supply. Second, the separation of factory and network reform. In 2002, the State Council issued document No. 5, which clearly proposed that the former state power companies should be divided into seven according to the principle of ""separating plant networks and bidding on the Internet"", and establish two power grid companies and five power generation groups. This reform adapts to the rapid growth of the national economy and the surge of the demand for electricity, which makes the construction scale of the power grid reach an unprecedented level. The third is a separate reform of resettlement. At the heart of this reform is the dismantling of grid companies in the power production, transport, trade and consumption chains. Power sales, regulation of natural monopoly, liberalization of non-natural monopoly, introduction of competition mechanism, market determines the allocation of power resources. These three reforms have a far-reaching impact on the development of the electric power industry and the national economy as a whole [3]. Every reform faces changes in management systems, models and processes. Prior to the first reform, the power companies were managed in accordance with government management functions and were managed and developed as functional units. GOVERNMENT-ENTERPRISE MERGER MODEL, provincial, municipal and county-level power companies relatively independent, investment and construction funds shortage. After the reform and opening-up, the power investment channel is strengthened, the power grid construction strength is strong, the power grid scale is expanding day by day. With the second reform of the power system, China's power industry has formed a unified power management industry dominated by the two major power grid companies and the five major power generation groups, making the management of the power industry more standardized, professional, and also adapt to modern enterprises. The management request has formed the consummation management business process, the province, the city, the county electric power management department has changed from the function management to the process management. 3. Basic function of electric network In the process of digitalization developing to intelligentization, a new technological revolution will be set off. This year, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) proposed the comprehensive construction of the ""ubiquitous power internet of things"", which is part of the ""Made in China 2025"" and an important strategic layout for SGCC to go to China and realize the ""Industry 4.0"". After more than 140 years' development, China's power industry has realized Regional Power Grid Operation Structure and regional balance of China's power energy. The Electric Power Industry has become an important basis for China's energy transformation and upgrading. Information, digital and smart devices and technologies will be widely used in the power industry. One end of the grid is connected to energy production, and energy consumption is the basic platform for energy development and utilization [5]. It will closely link energy production and energy consumption, lead the pace of the industrial revolution in the energy field, become the forefront of the process of power digitalization and information, will become the leader of the Digital Economy Era. The grid integrates modern information technology and communication technology into one, which will eventually realize a powerful smart grid carrying power flow and ubiquitous power Iot, carrying data flow, complementing each other, integrating development, and forming a powerful Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 109",Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Economic Management and Cultural Industry (ICEMCI 2019),2019.0,0,0,"{'url': 'https://www.atlantis-press.com/article/125927511.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2991/aebmr.k.191217.001?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2991/aebmr.k.191217.001, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In support of this desired paradigm, the major U.S. Army's battle laboratories are performing key experiments to determine how the projected mix of personnel, materiel, and doctrine can be interwoven into a desired structure for the year 2015. In February 2003, the U.S. Army's battle command battle laboratory (BCBL-L) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas appraised, utilizing a more intuitive decision-making process, a simulated futuristic two thousand-man force structure with its anticipated equipment. There were several stated, and a few unstated, objectives to this experiment, necessitating the use of numerous observers and several data collection instruments. Of the data collection instruments, the principal instrument for team cognitive task analysis functions was the Wagon Wheel interview methodology. Of the tools, the principal tool employed to collaborate, consolidate and sustain the data collection events was a group support system. This paper first explores how the selected group support system tools were utilized to automate the Wagon Wheel process from a one-on-one manual process to an automated system that enabled simultaneous data collection from 20 individuals. This paper then examines how the concept of ThinkLets was used to define the Wagon Wheel process. Lastly, an exchange of ideas are provided, talking about the strong and weak points of using a group support system in the experiment, the problems that arose and the solutions employed, and some thoughts for using a group support system in the follow-on experiments.","37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

It is characterized by typical symptoms of lower functioning, diminished interest in activities, insomnia or hypersomnia, fatigue or loss of energy and observable psycho motor agitation or retardation. Many studies exist with an aim to predict the geriatric depression from the perspective of healthcare informatics based on data mining analytics. However, there is no study emphasizing on the performance of stacking mechanism, which is one of ensemble classifiers. Therefore, this study is concerned with investigating the performance of stacking approach to predicting the geriatric depression-related dataset from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) ranging from 2010 to 2015. The KNHANES is a publicly available big dataset out of a national surveillance system aimed at assessing the health and nutritional status of Koreans since 1998. It is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey including approximately 10,000 individuals each year as a survey sample. By using 9,089 dataset regarding the geriatric depression in the Korean elderly (2010 ~2015), this study analyzed the changes in performance of the stacking mechanism when combining five classifiers (i.e., LR, DT, NN, SVM, NBN) in the base-level learner and meta-level learner. The performance of stacking mechanism measured in accuracy and AUC shows more robust pattern when the base-level learner is relatively simple (like LR, DT), and the meta-level learner is rather complex (like NBN, NN, SVM). To be specific, before the feature selection, the stacking performance was very competitive with accuracy 0.8624 when LR(SVM) indicating that the base-level learner is LR, and the meta-level learner is SVM. After the feature selection, the stacking performance was best with accuracy 0.8643 when DT (NN). With AUC, the similar results were obtained- i.e., LR(NN) with 0.8182 before the feature selection, and LR(NBN) with 0.8147 after the feature selection.",IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics,2017.0,16,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICHI.2017.95?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI.2017.95, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4b19fa2fcfe00a172722788e937ec3ab54e5e9ac,"CST, a freeware for predicting crop yield from remote sensing or crop model indicators: Illustration with RSA and Ethiopia","CST (Crop Statistics Tool) is a standalone freeware for predicting crop yield statistics using indicators derived from crop models, weather or remote sensing data. The principle of CST is that years similar to the target year (e.g. the current year) should have similar yields, or similar yield deviations from a technological time trend. In practice, CST guides the crop analyst through standard steps: after data screening to identify possible outliers and analysis of time trend, the crop analyst has the choice between the following two approaches to forecast yield: (1) multiple regression analysis in which a linear relationship is calibrated between historical yield data and yield indicators, while accounting for a time trend if present; (2) scenario analysis, whereby CST looks for the years most similar (according to the indicators) to the current year to estimate a yield deviation from the time trend or the average yield. CST allows to assess models with standard statistics and tests as well as warnings, which is especially useful when many indicators are available. Moreover, thanks to batch processing, the crop analyst can test a given model for various dekads, regions or crops. This paper illustrates the interest of CST with two case studies made over Africa and based on the regression approach between crop yields and NDVI or cumulated rainfall at a given dekad. In the first one, South African maize yields at province level over 1987–2015 were found to be well correlated with Vegetation/ProbaV NDVI or CHIRPS rainfall for two of the three main maize producing provinces; for each province, we tested indicators from the 15 dekads between January and May. In the second study, we regressed the 1999–2014 maize yields from the main 26 crop production zones against also NDVI and cumulated rainfall with two different start dates (April and June); we tested 3000 models (26 zones, 15 dekads, 3 single indicators without and with time trend, all indicators together, and finally trend alone) and obtained mixed results: a strong dominance of the time trend and for the indicators, unstable relationships and sometimes wrong slope signs. Beyond these contrasting results that could be partly due to the quality of yield statistics or the relevance of the selected indicators, CST combined with the SPIRITS tool for extracting indicators at region level from raster time series, should help crop analysts predict crop yield, in particular where many indicators derived from remote sensing data or crop models are to be tested.",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics,2017.0,6,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/AGRO-GEOINFORMATICS.2017.8047071?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/AGRO-GEOINFORMATICS.2017.8047071, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

77feff83e29f683ba43231e8582479fb7b7b0be3,"Impacts of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the Olive Yield in the Mediterranean Region, Turkey","Turkey ranks the 5th in the world in terms of total olive fields, and the 4th in terms of olive production. Although this ranking varies over the years because of the periodicity feature of the olive, Turkey is an important olive producer country in Mediterranean. The olive tree (Olea europaea L.) is a member of the maquis community that is involved in the natural vegetation of the Mediterranean climate. It is accepted as a bioindicator that characterizes this zone because of its good adaptation to the Mediterranean climate. According to the report of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the year 2016 was determined as the year with the highest global average temperatures (1880-2018). It is considered that the variability in climatic conditions and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events (extreme precipitaion, floods, extreme temperatures, heat waves, hail, etc.) that have been occurring frequently in recent years are associated with the changes in the large-scale pressure and wind circulation and atmospheric oscillations (with direct and indirect effects, e.g. NAO-North Atlantic Oscillation, AO-Arctic Oscillation and ENSO-El Nino Southern Oscillation, etc.). In this study, the effects of Southern Oscillation (El Nino/ La Nina) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the olive yield in Turkey will be examined. The objective of this study is to a.) determining the statistical relationship between climatic conditions and atmospheric index values during the phenological periods of olives, b) determining the effects of oscillations on yield by examining the years of strong atmospheric oscillation indexes and yield values on the line graph. To do this, the phenological periods of the olive were determined. Daily average temperature data of 48 years covering the years 1970-2017 for Adana, Osmaniye, Kahramanmaraş, Antalya, Mersin and Iskenderun meteorological stations, and daily average total rainfall data were used as the climatic data. Nino 3, Nino 3.4, Nino 4 and ONI indexes representing the El Nino activities and effective during the 1970-2017 period and the NAOI index representing the North Atlantic Oscillation were used. The relationship between the monthly average temperatures which were effective in the phenological period of olive and the atmospheric index values was statistically analyzed according to Pearson correlation coefficient method. As a result of the analyses, statistically significant relationships varying between 40-64% were found between average temperatures during the flowering and first initiation of fruit period among the phenological periods of the olive and Nino 3.4 and Nino 3 indexes. Statistically significant relationships varying between 38-60% were found between total rainfall and Nino indexes. In addition, no statistically significant relationship was found between North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) and climatic conditions. In order to determine the effect of the oscillations on yield by determining the yield values on the line graph with the years with strong atmospheric oscillation indexes, yield values of the olive covering the years between 1991-2017 were used. According to this, the yield of olive was below the average in the strong El Nino years, which were determined as 1991, 1997, 2009, 2015 and 2016. These years in general correspond to the periods when drought was experienced in the area including the Mediterranean Region in Turkey.",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics,2019.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820566?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820566, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a465c8bfbfdc58bd6e84b2cfd54d534b0734d71a,Understanding rollover data,"Internet service providers (ISPs) have been facing heavy competition to attract more users in the mobile data market, along with growing operational costs. Most mobile data plans charge users a fixed fee for a monthly data quota, and any unused data at the end of each month will be wasted. In the beginning of 2015, both AT&T and T-Mobile reinstated rollover data plans with constrained eligibility. Users could then keep the unused portion of their monthly data quotas for use in a future month(s). In this work, we evaluate the benefits of rollover data for both ISPs and users as well as identify the types of users who would upgrade to rollover data plans. To do so, we consider two alternatives: a smaller data plan without rollover data, and a more expensive data plan with larger monthly quota that does include rollover data. We find that moderately price-sensitive users benefit from rollover data: price-insensitive users would not have any data to rollover, while extremely price-sensitive users would not find the rollover data worth its higher cost. Under specific bounds on the size of the rollover data plan's monthly quota, we find that users can obtain more utility and ISPs can profit from rollover data, which is verified on one year of usage data from a U.S. ISP.",Conference on Computer Communications Workshops,2016.0,13,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/INFCOMW.2016.7562159?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2016.7562159, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

78e927f7fe51474dd231a17a88518867acfda153,Building Inclusiveness in a PBL Based Online Robotics Competition: Challenges and Outcomes,"e-Yantra conducts an annual online competition, e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) which incorporates a Project-Based Learning (PBL) methodology to train students to implement a robotics project in a step-by-step manner over a five month period. The competition is designed to provide all the resources - robot, accessories, and a project - to each participating team to make the competition accessible to students from the remotest parts of India. Every year the goal is to increase the number of participating teams selected through an online selection test. Even though multiple teams from a college qualify, we restrict the number of teams from a college to the number of unique ""Themes"" -- projects abstracted into rulebooks -- assigned in the competition. In eYRC-2013, 72 teams (out of 232 teams) who had qualified through the selection test could not be included in the competition, as we had only 5 unique Themes. In 2014, we started a parallel competition, eYRC+ Pilot to include all the qualifying teams. In this paper we describe the methodology used in this competition where we experimented with a Theme involving an advanced topic -- Image Processing - such that we could assign the same theme to more number of teams. Our analysis of performance of teams show that contrary to our hypothesis, the learning outcomes of teams in the various tasks assigned in the competition are comparable to that of teams participated in the eYRC themes. Analyzing the effectiveness of the competition in imparting PBL, based on feedback received from the teams, we find that eYRC+ is as effective as eYRC.

12332e627937931f6c52375063afd7a4983b0a7b,The development of iCALL application for Thai learners to study a LAO language,"Language is a method of human communication and essential to express ourselves, e.g., ideas, feelings, thoughts. With an agreement of ten ASEAN nations in 2007, the regional economic integration, also known as the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), will be established by 2015. In particular, Thailand is currently the largest trading partner of Laos with an estimated value of annual merchandise export to Laos over $1000 billion per year. For Thai people, studying a Lao language is a great advantage to better understand each other, such as relationship, tradition and culture. Afterwards, it can increase opportunities for prospective merchandise between two countries. This paper presents the development of “Interactive Computer-Assisted Language Learning (iCALL) Application for Learning a Lao Language”. The objective of iCALL is to provide Lao language learners with extra materials for self-study support. The system was designed based on the Learning Theories, Educational Psychology and Human Computer Interaction. The iCALL was developed as a Windows 8 application to support touch-screen devices with enhanced illustration of learning lessons using audio, animatic and animation.",2014 Third ICT International Student Project Conference (ICT-ISPC),2014.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICT-ISPC.2014.6923210?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICT-ISPC.2014.6923210, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3ffb3ff7726f49d9768c4922d7cf0d66761183b6,Game theoretic vulnerability analysis for the optimal defense of high speed rail,"High-speed rail (HSR) holds promise as an investment to modernize our country's transportation infrastructure and serve as a driver for our national economy. The five-hundred billion dollar price tag necessitates thorough analysis and planning upfront to ensure long-term success, including a well formulated vulnerability analysis to identify an optimal strategy for deploying protective technologies and infrastructure that will render the HSR network resilient to disruptions induced by natural disasters and terrorist threats. This paper embeds a game theoretic vulnerability assessment technique that considers the impact of defending the links of the network on network vulnerability into a genetic algorithm, which searches for the optimal assignment of finite defensive resources to the links of the network. The approach is applied to the incremental HSR network deployment map given by the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, describing network construction over a fifteen year period from 2015 to 2030.",IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security,2012.0,7,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/THS.2012.6459866?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2012.6459866, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This poster reports on our experience creating an eighteen-week lab curriculum for fifth grade students. Using Processing, an open source programming language and IDE that is built on the Java programming language, we developed and taught eighteen separate lab components introducing basic coding concepts appropriate for fifth grade. These lab modules were developed by a team consisting of a fifth grade teacher, a computer science master's student, and a computer science professor. The labs were taught to over 100 fifth grade students in the 2014-15 academic school year at a public school, Peabody Charter School. All coding labs produced visual output, either static scenes or animations. Topics included basic syntax with a large focus on two dimensional spatial reasoning, but also included three different modules focused on concepts from the fifth grade science curriculum. All curriculum is available at http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~zwood/Outreach/PCS/PCS5.html. This poster breaks down the basic lab components developed and presents challenges and positive outcomes. In general, students enjoyed the exercises; the teacher observed that all students were eager to complete the labs. Prior to this experience the teacher had no programming knowledge and learned alongside the students each week. He continues to teach the Processing modules in the fifth grade for the 2015-16 school year.",Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2016.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/2839509.2850554?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/2839509.2850554, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

c1e71890a99285f955c6d44dda2e9ae580981664,Modeling and Forecasting of Fuel Selling Price Using Time Series Approach: Case Study,"The liberalization of the petroleum sector in Morocco has a significant effect for petroleum product distributors. Since the beginning of December 2015, fuel prices are freely determined. This event presents many constraints affecting the balance of the sector plus the competition between its economic players. The lack of accompanying measures by the State makes this vital reform for public finances that stop subsidizing the price of gasoline vulnerable. With the halt of the competitive manufacturing's activity, Morocco's only refinery, distributors must, for their part, build up large stocks. As all fuel products are imported, we will be interested in the evolution by making forecasts of the price of fuels in the Moroccan market. In order to achieve their objectives, the oil companies must rely on precise forecasts. In this context, our paper aims mainly to study the time series of diesel and gasoline in order to provide precise forecasts to the company and to respect the permissible error margin of 3%. To this end, we worked with the ARIMA method. We found that the ARIMA model (1,1,1) gives forecasts of the price of gasoline near the margin to be met for the first quarter of the current year with an average error margin of 2,855%. In addition, the assumption that the residuals are a Gaussian white noise has always been verified.","International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies",2018.0,7,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/CoDIT.2018.8394835?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/CoDIT.2018.8394835, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The WHO noted that there were 47.5 million people with dementia worldwide in 2016. As the number of people with dementia in low- and middle-income countries continue to increase, it is predicted that the total number of people with dementia will reach 75.6 million in 2030 and reach 135.5 million in 2050. The National Health and Family Planning Commission released the “China Family Development Report (2015)”, which is half of the total number of elderly people. The number of severely mentally disabled patients registered in the country reached 4.297 million, and there were 1, 650 national mental health professional institutions and more than 20, 000 psychiatrists. As of 2012, there were 681 prisons in the country, 300, 000 people in prison, and 1.64 million prisoners. More than 80% of the prisons have established video surveillance systems. The Ministry of Public Security’s “Emergency Release Platform for Children’s Missing Information” is about 100 people abducted every year. The number of missing children who are about one-millionth of a year is not found, and the missing rate is about three-tenths of a million. The real-time positioning of the above-mentioned special population has become the key to solving related problems. Relevant nursing homes, community institutions, mental health institutions, and prisons have become the main demand side.",IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2020.0,1,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/719/1/012055', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1757-899X/719/1/012055?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/719/1/012055, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

7e63994054ba96c042ed3617e914be85a3daac2c,Foreword to the Applied Data Science: Invited Talks Track at KDD-2017,"The Applied Data Science (ADS) Invited Talks Track at KDD-2017 is a continuation of what has now become a ""7-year tradition"" at KDD conferences. This is the second year the track operates under the ADS name, an evolution from its origins at KDD-2011 as the ""Industry Practice Expo"". The KDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) is the world's first, largest and best conference on Data Science, Data Mining, and Knowledge Discovery. It brings together a healthy mix of academic researchers, industry and government researchers, and practitioners from a wide range of institutions and fields. The primary focus on KDD is on peer-reviewed research contributions and the academic advancement of the field. This is an important goal and in fact the KDD conference is now recognized as the most competitive and prestigious forum for presenting high quality research results. KDD, being fundamentally an applied field, needs the strong representation of applied work of big impact. Over the years of running the conference we observed that our initial speaker-selection approach needed to be re-thought because of the important contributions made to the field outside traditional academic, industrial and government research laboratories. The result of this re-thinking was to create a forum that exposes important contributions to Data Science through Big Data Applications that address strategic problems. We wanted to effectively capture the rising importance of Data Science and Machine Learning especially in the Big Data environment where structured and unstructured data create special challenges, and of course present new opportunities. The goal of the Invited Talks Track is to curate contributions from leaders in our field who have made important contributions through the development of a system, the creation of a new and important business, or the development and market introduction of a product,. Some of these important contributions may never see an academic paper or detailed peer-reviewed paper written about them, yet they are of critical importance to our very applied field. To give you an idea of how rapidly growing this area is, and how this sector of our industry and promises to be highly disruptive across many industries, we cite a couple of articles out of a plethora of such coverage: According to IDC, the global revenues from Big Data and business will grow from $130.1 billion in 2016 to more than $203 billion in 2020, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.7% [1]. Furthermore, to quote from a Forbes article: ""Data monetization"" will become a major source of revenues, as the world will create 180 zettabytes of data (or 180 trillion gigabytes) in 2025, up from less than 10 zettabytes in 2015.?

Using this expressive language we are addressing all the views needed to develop real time web centric intelligent health care diagnostic system. UML which is a standard language for software blueprints and whose vocabulary and rules focus on the conceptual and physical representation of the system is used to represent a web based diabetes expert system. As a case study, the web based diabetes expert system WEBDIACIN is presented. Diabetes is the single most important metabolic disease, which can affect nearly every organ in the body. It has been projected that 300 million individuals would be afflicted with diabetes by the year 2025. In India, it is estimated 19.4 million individuals are victims of this deficiency. We propose a medical network based on state-of-the-art medical kiosk that addresses the problems of providing preventive and diagnostic health care. The combination of an expert system with the benefits of web technology allows that several doctors and patients use the benefits of the system of support the detection of diabetes. The rules of the expert system are applied to diabetes, and the related diseases in the diabetes evaluation.",International Conferences on Biomedical and Bioinformatics Engineering,2008.0,6,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICBBE.2008.746?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2008.746, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

153e2e73fd64944b756328bc83afe0d6dacb5daf,Manifesto Redux,"The Manifesto for Teaching Online is a series of short statements first written in 2011 by the Digital Education group at the University of Edinburgh.  It was designed to articulate a position about online education that informs the work of the group and the MSc in Digital Education programme it leads. This position was perhaps best summarised by the first of the manifesto statements: Distance is a positive principle, not a deficit. Online can be the privileged mode. 
Such a position was (and to an extent still is) at odds with dominant discourses of digital education that described it either in terms of replication of offline practices, or in terms of inadequacy, where online learning is the ‘second best' option when ‘real' (face-to-face) encounters are not possible or practical. We rejected both of these positions, and the instrumental approaches to online education that tend to accompany them. 
The manifesto was initially developed over a period of a year, June 2010-May 2011, and it was further shaped and refined during a series of discussions and events among students and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh. Responses to the document ranged from excitement to discomfort, and when the manifesto was launched in early 2012, it was met with considerable interest. It was intended to stimulate ideas about creative online teaching, and to reimagine some of the orthodoxies and unexamined truisms surrounding the field. Each point was deliberately interpretable, and it was made open so that others could remix and rewrite it. In early 2015, the Digital Education group itself began to revisit and reassemble the manifesto, with new points covering emerging issues such as openness and ‘massiveness' in online education, teacher automation, new research on spatiality and temporality, and digital authorship. 
This paper discusses the way the manifesto has changed between 2011 and 2015 to reflect shifts in the field of research. In addressing some of the themes and issues informing the 2015 version, it discusses what we believe to be some of the most pressing critical issues facing practitioners of networked and digital education in the current moment.",Proceedings of the International Conference on Networked Learning,2016.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.54337/nlc.v10.8821?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.54337/nlc.v10.8821, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

36f3b07734df79cc5c311f454082c6176b285d30,A Modified Genetic Optimization Algorithm Using Ancestor Path Extrapolation,"Optimization techniques have become increasingly popular in building performance simulation and design. The relatively high computational expense of simulating a building for a full year has traditionally been a major obstacle in the widespread use of these techniques. Consequently, most practical implementations employ some variety of meta-heuristics which do not necessarily guarantee an optimal solution but also do not require an impractical number of simulations to run. Still, further gains in convergence speed are needed for automated optimization to become truly practical in building design. This paper introduces a modified genetic optimization algorithm which implements a new creation operator to improve the rate of convergence in building performance optimization. The performance of the new algorithm was compared to that of a traditional genetic algorithm using a test case building model with 26 real valued design variables over several optimization runs. The new algorithm displayed a faster rate of convergence in all tests. The improved convergence rate was independent of the initial population fitness and building location. These results show that genetic algorithms with ancestor path extrapolations can greatly reduce the computational time required in building performance optimization. Introduction The goal of optimization in building simulation is to determine the set of design parameters that optimize one or more objective functions. The essential difficulty in these optimizations is that the evaluation of the most popular objective function (building energy consumption) is very time consuming. This has led to the wide use of metaheuristic optimization algorithms, which do not guarantee an optimal solution but also do not require a large number of calls to the building simulation engine compared to other methods (Nguyen et al. 2014). One of the most popular classes of meta-heuristic algorithms used in building performance optimization is the class of genetic algorithms (GA). These algorithms attempt to optimize building performance by mimicking natural selection over a number of generations of potential solutions. Implementations of the basic GA have been successfully used to solve a variety of building performance optimization problems (Palonen et al. 2009, Rahmani Asl et al. 2014, Xu et al. 2016). The ready availability of the basic GA in packages such as jMetal (Durillo and Nebro 2011) and Optimo (Rahmani Asl et al. 2015) have also helped increase the popularity of this algorithm in building design. Implementations of a genetic optimization algorithm can still be very time consuming, with run times being reported as high as 23 hours to simulate 30 generations (Xu et al. 2016). As a result, additional techniques have been used to reduce this burden. One of these techniques is to reduce the initial population size or the total number of generations; however, this can result in the selection of sub-optimal solutions. Another technique, the use of surrogate models, has been shown to effectively reduce the computational burden associated with running GAs on building models (Magnier and Haghighat 2009, Tresidder et al. 2011, Aijazi and Glicksman 2016). Surrogate models are simplified models which are constructed to have behavior similar to the actual detailed building model. This technique reduces computation time because the surrogate model executes much faster than the detailed model when evaluating the objective function; however, there is some loss in accuracy when using the surrogate model. This paper introduces a method for creating new individuals in a genetic algorithm based on the paths created by ancestors. When used in conjunction with traditional crossover and mutation, this method can reduce the time required to approach an optimal solution. Basic Genetic Algorithm Overview The basic genetic algorithm for single objective optimization can be defined as shown in Figure 1.

19d2ca4e38b3c51556357e7f4d853fe0a085e21c,Incorporating FEA in an undergraduate biomechanics course,"A bioengineering course is offered to senior students in the Mechanical Engineering major as an elective at Penn State Behrend in the first semester of their senior year. On average around 20 students enroll in this project-based course and 72% of their grade depends on three comprehensive group projects, one of which is to design a bone plate for a fractured femur. 6% of the grade comes from an individual application presentation, discussing different circumstances in which the concepts in mechanical engineering can be applied to solve/analyze biomedical problems. Background of physiology is introduced in the class while the majority of applicable engineering knowledge was learned in prerequisite courses, such as statics, dynamics, strength of materials, system dynamics, etc. Finite Element Analysis (FEA), an elective offered in both semesters of senior year, is not a prerequisite for this bioengineering course. Most of students enrolled in our bioengineering course either do not have FEA course or are taking FEA concurrently. Therefore in spite of its popularity in the areas related to biomechanics, thus far FEA has not been incorporated in this bioengineering course. Previously, the fractured femur project utilized the applicable theoretical analyses including those from statics, strength of materials, materials, and machine design. In Fall 2015, the instructor of bioengineering course made an effort to have an FEA study on femur and ensuing presentation be completed by a willing student. This student was taking FEA simultaneously with bioengineering, and was scheduled to present during the last week of semester. The instructor of FEA wrote an introductory manual of FEA procedures to analyze a healthy femur using a CAD model of the femur. Then the student used the manual to initiate the FEA study of the fractured femur. A major challenge to the student was the complicated loading and assembly feature of the bone plus the addition of bone plate. After a several week struggle and independent learning, while guided by the faculty members of bioengineering and FEA, the student was able to accomplish the FEA analysis and presented the results to the class. The discrepancy between FEA results and theoretical analysis was shown to be less than 5% in most results. The presentation also included FEA results for a diverse realistic loading and boundary conditions. Since all students had finished the fractured femur project, they actively participated in a meaningful discussion after the presentation. The completion of this project demonstrated the feasibility and importance of incorporating FEA in our bioengineering course. In addition, the presenting student was able to complete a working manual for the FEA analysis of the fractured femur, which can be passed to the future students of this course. A plan is to include FEA in the project as a bonus activity, and regarding the formation of project teams, the instructor would appoint a member who is enrolled in the FEA course. An assignment or project, based on the present FEA study of the femur, can also be incorporated in the FEA course offered at our campus.",Frontiers in Education Conference,2016.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757627?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757627, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This paper presents an optimal design of network-on-chip interconnects in many-core architectures. A comprehensive optimization methodology is proposed that bridges circuit and technology aspects of inter-core interconnects. The optimal global interconnect is shown to be minimum pitch and minimum dimension limited for a 1000 core chip implemented in the technology year 2015. For the same chip, it is shown that the energy per bit in global wires can be reduced by a significant margin of 16% on optimizing its width, spacing and repeater insertions. These results are drastically different from previous optimizations where the optimal width was many times larger than minimum dimension. The results presented in this paper have important implications for interconnect process development for future technology nodes and also for benchmarking emerging interconnect technologies.",2010 IEEE International Interconnect Technology Conference,2010.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IITC.2010.5510317?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IITC.2010.5510317, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

35904a222bd2ebd75f16746983665ea7ea065134,A novel econometric model for peak demand forecasting,"The future of generation, transmission and distribution of electrical energy depends primarily on accurate demand forecasting. Demand forecasting can be carried out on the basis of load in MW or energy in MWh [1]. Electricity forecasts are needed for generation and network expansion planning; evaluation of tariffs; operations and despatch management. The electricity supply industry in Zimbabwe is facing many technical problems (such as generation deficiencies) and other economic challenges resulting in wide spread load shedding programmes [7, 10]. An insight into a solution of these problems will be an in-depth study of the load forecasting techniques being currently used. A simplified economic model, based on a multiple linear regression approach, for the prediction of the electricity demand in Zimbabwe is proposed in the paper: the peak demand is defined as a function of GDP, CPI, population and temperature. A 30-year historical data set (from 1980 to 2010) was gathered from several sources. Statistical techniques using the MATLAB, SPSS and EXCEL software environments were then used in building the prediction model and their performance compared. The main contributions of the proposed paper are: An enhanced understanding of the load forecasting issues being faced by electricity supply industries in developing countries such as Zimbabwe, for example.

Using various parameters such as a) monthly energy production, b) wind turbine down time in hours, c) external grid/internal grid non-availability in hours, (i) machine availability, (ii) grid availability, (iii) system availability, (iv) annual usage time and (v) capacity factor were calculated. From the available data of energy production from December 2004 to June 2016, for each of the turbines, it was found that turbine T7 produced maximum energy while T12 produced minimum energy. During the two years period from July 2014 to June 2016, it is found that the highest energy production months are September in 2014 and August in 2015. It is also noticed that the energy production of the machines can be improved by increasing the system availability. By using statistical analysis and weibull distribution parameters, Chauhan and Saini predicted a capacity factor of 9.16% and energy prediction of 485 MWh/year. However, practical values obtained from the wind farm site are capacity factor of 22.08% and 22.60% and values of energy production are 1160.50 MWh and 1191 MWh in 2014–15 and 2015–16 respectively.",International Conference on Emerging Technological Trends,2016.0,5,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICETT.2016.7873694?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETT.2016.7873694, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Despite the fact that a high percentage of the flying aircraft fleet is equipped to fly the offset automatically, it is not used in operations. Therefore it would be useful to model the potential of lateral offset and to simulate it as a single manoeuvre to get a better understanding of its performance. This study uses a simulation model covering the densest parts of European en route airspace with traffic levels forecast up to the year 2025. Different parameters of the offset manoeuvre are evaluated like the moment of start of implementation, the offset angle, the offset distance, and the duration of the manoeuvre until its return to the initial flight plan. The main performance metric that is applied is the capability to resolve conflicts and conflict clusters. The discussion targets the use of lateral offset in the Multi Sector Planner concept.",Digital Avionics Systems Conference,2005.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/DASC.2005.1563341?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2005.1563341, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This situation will only worsen in the years to come, as it is expected that U.S. air traffic will nearly double by the year 2025. There is a pressing need therefore for increasing capacity to meet future demand, improving safety, enhancing efficiency, providing additional flexibility to airline operators, and equitable consideration of multiple stakeholder needs in this complex dynamic system. In this paper, we present a scalable enterprise framework for multi-stakeholder, multi-objective model-based planning and optimization of air traffic in the national airspace system (NAS). The approach is based on an intelligent evaluation and optimization at the strategic and flight route levels. At the strategic level, we focus on separations between flights to improve airspace system performance. At the flight route level, we focus on identifying an optimal portfolio of flight paths within a planning horizon that trades-off a reduction in miles flown and a reduction in congestion. This framework not only considers system-level objectives, but also regards the impact of decisions on the principal stakeholders within the NAS. It is expected that this system will serve as a key decision-support tool to address future NAS scalability and reliability needs.",IEEE Aerospace Conference,2007.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/AERO.2007.352955?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.352955, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

bd371e1aff673876fd221b875b04740f74108613,Optimization of Cost and Time of Repair and Rounding of Roads With Way Pavement Design Manual Method 2013,"Smoothness, safety, and comfort of traffic depend on road pavement conditions. If the width of the road is narrow, damaged, hollow, the traffic will disrupted; the travel time will increase, fuel consumption increases, the risk of damage to high vehicles and so on, if there is no immediate improvement in the form of an increase, the damage will increase. To deal with this problem, it is necessary to research and plan road improvements with widening, an increase in existing pavements with overlays, the need for cost and time of implementation. The Mojokerto - Ploso road segment is an alternative route connecting the cities of Mojokerto - Jombang, and Lamongan. Based on the status of the road is the provincial road, and based on the function is the Collector’s road. Furthermore, for the planning of improvement and widening required subgrade CBR data, for overlay planning, a Test Pit data is needed to determine the existing pavement structure and traffic data. In determining the road widening plan, the 2015 revised Road Pavement Design Manual (MDP) method for overlaying was used with the Planning Guidelines for Pt-T-01-2002-B Bending Pavement Thickness and calculating the Budget using Work Unit Price Analysis (AHSP ) 2013, creating a Schedule of Work (Time Schedule), as well as calculating the critical path to find out the critical path in carrying out the work. To planning data analysis is needed - traffic data, land investigation, layer thickness calculation on widening, overlay layer thickness, cost requirements, execution time and critical track path. From the calculation results, the road widening obtained AC = 5 cm pavement arrangement, ATB = 14 cm, CTB = 30 cm, Class B Aggregate = 20 cm, the optional load support layer = 85 cm, using geogrid as the selected urine separator with subgrade, in the old pavement repair (overlay) with an overlay, the AC = 5 cm arrangement, ATB = 14 cm, at a cost of Rp. 19,200,000,000.00 (Nineteen billion two hundred million rupiahs) with a 20-year plan life, as well as a 6-month implementation time.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2019.0,0,0,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1364/1/012068', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1742-6596/1364/1/012068?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1364/1/012068, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

53bbc951738040da2a732ac850ddffb184739289,Gateway to Chips: High Speed I/O Signalling and Interface,"The design of inputs and outputs to integrated circuits has traditionally been a straightforward task involving procurement of a specification and its implementation. In the past few technology generations design and implementation of integrated circuit I/O's have become much more complex. Just as Moore's Law predicts that functions per chip will double every 1.5-2 years to keep up with consumer demand, there is a corresponding demand for processing electrical signals at progressively higher rates. The international technology roadmap for semiconductors (ITRS) predicts the I/O bandwidth (Gb/s) for high performance ASICs to be 30 Gb/s by the year 2015. Adding to the complexity is the need to conform to a plethora of emerging I/O specifications and continued focus on reliability regarding electro static discharge (ESD) and simultaneous switching noise (SSN), and the circuit designer has about as much challenges as one can stand. This tutorial presents the techniques and methods employed to build a low power, high bandwidth, highly reliable I/O. It covers the popular signaling standards like LVDS, DDR, XAUI and PCI-Express.

Despite the demand and growth of this new field due to its public health importance, only 4 out of the 107 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) nationwide offers a Bachelor's of Science (B.S.) in Bio-Engineering related fields. In order to contribute to a growing BME Workforce, HBCUs need to react and offer more degree-programs relevant to BME. At the University of the District of Columbia (UDC), an HBCU and the District's only public institution for higher learning, we have recently established a new, degree program: Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering (B.S. in BME) full-board approved in Fall 2014, with program activities initiated in Fall 2015. The educational goal of this program is to enhance the quality and diversity of the BME Workforce via student professional development, new and relevant BME courses, and BME scholarly activities (e.g., guest lectures and journal club sessions), ultimately to increase the number of ethnic minorities pursuing careers and degrees in BME. Through our program activities, we are aiming to meet the nation's demand to contribute to a diverse BME workforce, directed towards solving problems in human health. A secondary, but related goal, is to increase the diversity of STEM-related fields. This paper summarizes our initial, but encouraging, BME activity-related findings. However, this study will be longitudinal (on a multiple year time period) to observe the true outcomes of our initiative.",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2016.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591684?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591684, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In this paper, by analyzing the working characteristics and environment of civil aviation airport staff, a hierarchical fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is introduced. For the complexity and variability of the working environment of airport, a composition operator adjusting the parameter's weight is proposed to enhance the flexibility of the evaluation model. In the fuzzy evaluation matrix selection stage, in order to structure a more scientific and objective evaluation matrix, the random sampling method is brought in to assess the relevant data about the evaluation target. By analyzing the airport's work records in 2015, the parameter weights are calculated, and the improved model is applied to the staff work performance evaluation in the first half of 2016.

The proposed seven year mission includes a flyby of main belt asteroid (108144) 2001 HM1, a flyby and impactor release (a la Deep Impact) at the Trojan asteroid (624) Hektor (a suspected contact binary) with companion P/2006, and a flyby with impactor release at the Centaur asteroid 39P/Oterma. The variety of types and positions of these small bodies will help answer some of the fundamental questions we have for the evolution and composition of our solar system. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Planetary Science Summer School team has designed a mission designed to address all of these scientific questions and design objectives. We will describe instrument selection, launch dates and mission timetables, measurement and encounter strategies, impactor design and benefits, data acquisition and communication tradeoffs and provide background into the mission science goals.

Tracking and monitoring from the coast all type of ship on a common operational picture is no more sufficient. An Innovative solution shall be set up to support human operators in their permanent surveillance tasks in vulnerable trading lanes and zones in order to detect abnormal or illicit vessel behaviour and to understand and to early identify threatening situations. Displaying thousands of tracks on a single display has be demonstrated its inefficiency, in front of all the cases of illegal immigration, terrorism, drugs trafficking, smuggling, illegal fishing, pollution, etc… that were recorded this year. This future generation of maritime surveillance system must allow: ▪ Permanent and all weather coverage of border maritime areas. ▪ Continuous collection and fusion of heterogeneous data provided by various types of sensors deployed on coast and on mobile platforms and other information from external sources. ▪ Supervised automatic detection of abnormal vessel behaviours (in track and performed activity) and generate justified alarms. ▪ Understanding of suspicious events and early identification of threats from series of detected spatiotemporal abnormal vessel behaviours (alarms). ▪ Generate electronic and formatted interpretation reports on the suspicious event to keep periodically informed decisional authorities. ▪ Anticipate the operational response mobilizing and using means with the best efficiency as possible ▪ To capitalize knowledge and work of each partner, within an inter-agencies and international framework, for a common benefit on a real time basis ▪ To ensure the data protection respecting the respective rules of information sharing. No equipment and information system deployed are currently able to answer all these requirements together. However, in the horizon of 2015 significant technical progresses will be made in wide maritime area coverage detection and highlighting abnormal behaviors methodology that could be usefully used together to built up an new generation of sea border surveillance integrated system for efficient security applications in high density traffics. The objectives of the SISMARIS project are: ▪ To build up a complete test system (end to end information acquisition and processing system). ▪ To test new maritime surveillance sensors and other available intelligent information sources in order to obtain optimal maritime security awareness. ▪ To demonstrate that this new information system will help the operator to analyze automatically a high density of tracks in order to highlight only the useful information, and detect some predefined behavior that could be abnormal or not. ▪ To give the police authorities a helpful tool to collect and register evidences in order to prosecute usefully offenders. The objectives of the ESISMARIS project are to extend the coverage of detection of SISMARIS by including Satellite AIS across North Atlantic Ocean, and to evaluate a new innovative solution in the fight against drugs transfer between Central America and Europe. Integrating existing and advanced capacities demonstrate, in the horizon of 2015 that actual sea surveillance system can be significantly completed and upgraded with innovative technologies to build up operational solution to fulfil the main sea border surveillance requirement which is to early identify threats in order to timely react.",2010 International WaterSide Security Conference,2010.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/WSSC.2010.5730234?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/WSSC.2010.5730234, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

SSA envisages to achieve Universal enrolment, Universal retention and Universal achievement apart from bridging all social and gender gaps at primary level by 2007 and elementary level by 2010. Development of useful indications based on reliable data and evidence are critical first steps not only in policy formulation but also in planning and implementation of any program. Under SSA, there are two separate methods to assess the problems of elementary education. They are VER & DISE. Village Education Registers records names of all pre school, in-school and out of school children of a village and are to be updated every year at the village level. VER is to be referred to bring all out of school children to school so as to ensure Universal enrolment. District information system on education (DISE) is meant to record various details about all schools with respect to infrastructure, teachers and students.

The exchange of ideas and information has exponentially risen with the usage of social media. Web users share more details with their friends and spend most time on social media, and the information obtained from their chat has been used in various applications. Social networking platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ are becoming increasingly popular, enabling users to share opinions on various topics, engage in discussions with diverse communities, and post messages globally. Sentiment Analysis (SA) is applied to Twitter data set for identifying the emotions of users and based on these, several issues can be solved. Twitter is a microblogging site that provides a good environment for SA. Sentiment classification done on Twitter data classifies the emotions in the tweets as neutral, negative, or positive. In this survey, 25 research papers on SA are reviewed. The methods of SA on Twitter are classified as Deep Learning, supervised methods, Hybrid, and other methods. For a reliable evaluation, research papers on SA published between 2015 and 2023 are collected. Finally, the evaluation is achieved based on the datasets, publication year, performance metrics, programming languages, and category analysis.

01c0ac74d1e1afef4458bb0b12fb88f6fe7ca9ed,WIP: An Evidence Gap Map Analysis of Personalized Adaptive Learning in Undergraduate Mathematics,"This work in progress research paper presents preliminary results of a meta-analysis using an evidence gap map that examines personalized adaptive learning (PAL) in undergraduate mathematics. Personalized adaptive learning (PAL) implements intelligent learning systems, integrates learner preferences, and analyzes individual learning data to create a unique learner path personalized to the needs of students. PAL may benefit students in mathematics courses such as college algebra which serves as a gatekeeper course, especially for those majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Our comprehensive meta-analysis of group design studies examines the average effect of PAL on undergraduate mathematics outcomes broadly and specifically on algebra. Thirteen databases were searched. At the first stage, titles and abstracts were screened. Articles violating one or more inclusion criteria were excluded. The second stage of screening was full-text review. Retained studies will have data extracted that will allow the effect size results to be meta-analyzed (which is beyond the scope of the evidence gap maps). Results to date: The search identified 12,734 studies and of those, 44 met inclusion criteria, four of which were merged into two studies resulting in 42 included studies. Of the 42 studies, 19 were published in the previous ten years and constitute the analytic sample for the EGM. Of these 19 studies, two (11%) incorporated a randomized design. The EGM of the number of studies by publication outlet and publication year indicates that of the six journal publications, about two-thirds were published in 2020 or more recent. In comparison, of the 13 non-journal publications, 69% of the non-journal publications were published between 2015–2019. The EGMs suggest the need for researchers to continue to seek rigorous designs for evaluating PAL to provide the strongest evidence. There is a growing and positive trend for PAL research to be published in journals which should assist in making results more discoverable.

bc59277ed12df16ce560aec1fb370290f4961d04,"Towards Green IoTs - Enabling Sustainable Environment, Bibliometric Analysis and Beyond","In the currently prevailing era of Industry 4.0 and servitisation in diverse fields, the major and the most vital regards has turned out to be conservation of energy and consequently eliminating the possibility of resource deficiency in Internet of Things (IoT). In a Green Internet of Things (G-IoT) network, IoT transmits data to and from a fusion node over multi hops. The sustainable operation is obtained by retrieving energy from ambient sources as well as from power grid. The foremost aim in achieving a sustainable ecosystem is to reduce the carbon emission in the environment. The concept of green manufacturing is thriving to its fullest and that too with the consent of the leading global enterprises. An exponential increase in the count of publications is seen on annual basis pertaining to the wide research scope in this field. A detailed study of the IoTs, Green IoTs, their architecture, characteristics and a few bibliometric analyses of the areas relating to green manufacturing is presented in this study to help in a better facilitation of any follow up research work. The database used for this bibliometric analysis is taken from Scopus and involves a total of 268 documents related to G-IoTs that too when no other limiting criteria is applied apart from “Articles” in “English” Language. It is found from the analysis that the most cited article is contributed by ZHU C in IEEE ACCESS in the year 2015, with a total citation of 290. Analysis in various aspects including most cited documents, country collaboration map, analysis of a thematic map and time slicing is performed, depicted and elaborated in this study. Finally, the inferences of this study form a basis of structuring and recommending the future directions possible to be explored.","2022 10th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions) (ICRITO)",2022.0,15,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICRITO56286.2022.9965158?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRITO56286.2022.9965158, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d7cb073a00640c1cf4a7616bb6a7cc2d3b65dc0b,Developing a Predictive Machine Learning Model to Determine the Likelihood of Readmission of Substance Abuse Patients in Zimbabwe,"This research aimed to address the issue of readmissions of substance use patients in Zimbabwe. The data used was obtained from one of the biggest psychiatric hospitals in Zimbabwe that offers outpatients and early rehabilitation services to psychotic patients. The dataset consisted of 1246 rows, 30 columns, and 921 unique patients. The features were combined to develop a predictive model that had a very good performance because it considered a cocktail of variables. The model accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score and AUC-ROC had scores above 97%. The Model Prototype was successfully deployed via a web-based platform to determine the likelihood of readmission of substance abuse patients on a scale of 0% to 100%. The major findings from the research are: 1) readmission is not one factor determined but is a factor of different influencers combined, 2) the most commonly used substances inducing psychosis in Zimbabwe were found to be alcohol, crystal meth, marijuana and nicotine, 3) substance-induced psychosis is exponentially increasing and geographically spanned because admitted patients came from 51 different towns, cities or town councils all over Zimbabwe. These findings provided actionable insights and recommendations for the ministry, which declared a national concern of substance abuse and henceforth launched a five-year ‘Zimbabwe National Drug Master Plan’ (ZNDMP 2020-2025).

bb6b11d2809f6a3e01feb4dcfceeceae0fd7dd87,Semantic Similarity Analysis between Future Topics and Their Neighbors in Topic Networks for Network-based Topic Evolution,"Topic evolution automatically tracks a set of concepts within a given dataset over time, assisting researchers to overview various research domains. Network-based topic evolution is one of the recent approaches incorporating relational models instead of traditional text-based models for allowing the detection of topic correlation events. Topics are represented with co-occurrence relationships instead of word vectors, connected over time through their positions in a network instead of their semantic similarities. This paper shows that the topics and their network representations share meaningfully similar semantics. The existence of such contextual relationships allows topics to be labeled without having enough direct textual appearances in the document collection. Forty fields-of-study keywords with 64,215 to 5.8 million related articles were selected from the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset containing more than 200 million publications. The semantics of topics within forty topic networks were found using three sets of word embeddings trained from a collection of 10.5 million Medline abstracts from the year 2000 to 2016, and word embeddings of the topics are compared against their network-based representations, which are their neighborhoods in the previous timeslot. Cosine similarities between topics and their neighbors consistently resulted in moderate correlations from the year 2001 to 2015, showing higher values for topics that were already present in the topic networks compared to newly emerging topics. The result suggested that labeling topics based on the network structure are possible without semantic analysis, which is necessary for predicting topic evolutions such as the topic emergence when future documents are unavailable.",2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2022.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020287?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020287, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

53553b882aa38825cdbf2a75f1cdd3953771b1fe,A Long-term Spatial and Temporal Analysis of NDVI Changes in Java Island Using Google Earth Engine,"Java is Indonesia’s and the world’s most populous island. The increase in population on the island of Java reduces the area of forest and other vegetation covers. Landslides, floods, and other natural disasters are caused by reduced vegetation cover. Furthermore, it has the potential to lead to the extinction of flora and fauna. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be used to monitor the vegetation cover. This study analyzes the NDVI changes value from 2005 to 2020 using Terra and Aqua MODIS image data processed using Google Earth Engine. Processing was carried out in some stages: down-setting, performing NDVI processing, calculating monthly average NDVI, calculating annual average NDVI, and analyzing. From the study results, the NDVI value of Terra and Aqua MODIS data has a solid but imperfect correlation coefficient due to differences in orbital time which causes differences in solar zenith angle, sensor viewing angle, and azimuth angle. Then from this study, it was found that overall, changes in vegetation density cover on the island of Java decreased, which was indicated by the NDVI decline rate of -0.00047/year. The most significant decrease in NDVI value occurred in the period 2015–2016, covering an area of 13994.630 km2, and the most significant increase in NDVI occurred in the period 2010–2011, covering an area of 2256.101 km2.",IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environment,2021.0,8,1,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/936/1/012038', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1755-1315/936/1/012038?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/936/1/012038, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4e759287d02a90cefb3233b0a6996aae2bb11c64,A Tensor-Based Sub-Mode Coordinate Algorithm for Stock Prediction,"The investment on the stock market is prone to be affected by the Internet. For the purpose of improving the prediction accuracy, we propose a multi-task stock prediction model that not only considers the stock correlations but also supports multi-source data fusion. Our proposed model first utilizes tensor to integrate the multi-sourced data, including financial Web news, investors' sentiments extracted from the social network and some quantitative data on stocks. In this way, the intrinsic relationships among different information sources can be captured, and meanwhile, multi-sourced information can be complemented to solve the data sparsity problem. Secondly, we propose an improved sub-mode coordinate algorithm (SMC). SMC is based on the stock similarity, aiming to reduce the variance of their subspace in each dimension produced by the tensor decomposition. The algorithm is able to improve the quality of the input features, and thus improves the prediction accuracy. And the paper utilizes the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to predict the stock fluctuation trends. Finally, the experiments on 78 A-share stocks in CSI 100 and thirteen popular HK stocks in the year 2015 and 2016 are conducted. The results demonstrate the improvement on the prediction accuracy and the effectiveness of the proposed model.",International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace,2018.0,21,3,"{'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07979', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07979, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We highlight a unique partnership between the cybersecurity training and research communities with the common goal of capturing human team performance. Whether in the context of a training assessment or a research endeavor; both are two sides of the same coin. As cybersecurity training events and competitions have evolved, there is increasing interest in analyzing the performance of the defenders as well as identifying the best methods of training, assessing, and educating the cybersecurity workforce. This includes analysis of the types of training, pedagogy, and the relationship between education, training, and commercial Information Technology (IT) certifications. In this work, we present a high-level look along with some initial findings from the premiere cyber training event for the Army National Guard Bureau focused on enhancing the capabilities of cyber defense teams to mitigate threats to critical national infrastructure. Our first year data collection effort was conducted in the spring of 2015 and involved multiple threads of data collection. The main realization to come from this study is that improved systems and procedures should be put in place to effectively monitor and quantify team behavior for valid analyses.

bf8e59afaa05e0045515b9bba901075018c88bd0,Agriculture Drought and Food Security Monitoring Over the Horn of Africa (HOA) from Space,"Global climate change has been resulting in more extreme weather and climate events, such as drought and heat wave. Food security has become a critical issue because of global population increase and extreme weather and climate events. The Horn of Africa (HOA, including Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia) is one of the most food-insecure regions in the world. Millions of people in the HOA are undernourished and at the risk of famine. Food security is a very complicated and interdisciplinary problem across many sectors. To study food security, it is essential to investigate innovative solutions to integrate and analyze various related data and information, especially satellite remote sensing measurements from space, and weather and climate information from ground observations. Satellite Remote sensing measurements have advantages in spatial and temporal coverage and can be used for long-term monitoring of crop status and drought events from space. This study aims to investigate the impacts of extreme agriculture drought and food security in the HOA region using the remote sensing data products from the NASA MODIS Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), a key instrument onboard the NASA satellites Terra and Aqua. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) data from year 2000 to 2017 are derived from the MODIS land surface reflectance and land surface temperature products and analyzed for assessment of vegetation health and the impacts of extreme drought events. The spatial patterns and temporal trends of vegetation stress and extreme drought events are discovered, which demonstrates the critical regions and period with food security. The results also show that the drought and food insecurity have increasing trends. For a case study, the strongest El Niño event of 2015–2016 impacting on extreme drought events in the HOA is analyzed. This study provides an integrated approach to food security monitoring and assessment, which is very helpful for in decision making and strategic planning for agriculture management, disaster relief and food security.",International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics,2018.0,16,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/AGRO-GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8476128?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/AGRO-GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8476128, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We conduct this study by analyzing the statistical behavior of posts and modeling user interactions around them. We have chosen Reddit as an example, since it has grown exponentially from a small community to one of the biggest social network platforms in the recent times. Due to its large user base and popularity, a variety of behavior is present among users in terms of their activity. Our study provides interesting insights about a large number of inactive posts which fail to gather attention despite their authors exhibiting Cyborg-like behavior to draw attention. We also present interesting insights about short-lived but extremely active posts emulating a phenomenon like Mayfly Buzz.

ba328804c19c15a8ec0404e01eb1ef0c6aaf1f40,Archival Crawlers and JavaScript: Discover More Stuff but Crawl More Slowly,"The web is today's primary publication medium, making web archiving an important activity for historical and analytical purposes. Web pages are increasingly interactive, resulting in pages that are correspondingly difficult to archive. JavaScript enables interactions that can potentially change the client-side state of a representation. We refer to representations that load embedded resources via JavaScript as deferred representations. It is difficult to discover and crawl all of the resources in deferred representations and the result of archiving deferred representations is archived web pages that are either incomplete or erroneously load embedded resources from the live web. We propose a method of discovering and archiving deferred representations and their descendants (representation states) that are only reachable through client- side events. Our approach identified an average of 38.5 descendants per seed URI crawled, 70.9% of which are reached through an onclick event. This approach also added 15.6 times more embedded resources than Heritrix to the crawl frontier, but at a crawl rate that was 38.9 times slower than simply using Heritrix. If our method was applied to the July 2015 Common Crawl dataset, a web-scale archival crawler will discover an additional 7.17 PB (5.12 times more) of information per year. This illustrates the significant increase in resources necessary for more thorough archival crawls.",ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries,2017.0,17,2,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/JCDL.2017.7991554?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/JCDL.2017.7991554, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

dccf159f21baeb40feaf03913bccdec6d8b14f6d,On the use of deep recurrent neural networks for detecting audio spoofing attacks,"Biometric security systems based on predefined speech sentences are extremely common nowadays, particularly in low-cost applications where the simplicity of the hardware involved is a great advantage. Audio spoofing verification is the problem of detecting whether a speech segment acquired from such a system is genuine, or whether it was synthesized or modified by a computer in order to make it sound like an authorized person. Developing countermeasures for spoofing attacks is clearly essential for having effective biometric and security systems based on audio features, all the more significant due to recent advances in generative machine learning. Nonetheless, the problem is complicated by the possible lack of knowledge on the technique(s) used to put forward the attack, so that anti-spoofing systems should be able to withstand also spoofing attacks that were not considered explicitly in the training stage. In this paper, we analyze the use of deep recurrent networks applied to this task, i.e. networks made by the successive combination of multiple feedforward and recurrent layers. These networks are routinely used in speech recognition and language identification but, to the best of our knowledge, they were never considered for this specific problem. We evaluate several architectures on the dataset released for the ASVspoof 2015 challenge last year. We show that, by working with very standard feature extraction routines and with a minimum amount of fine-tuning, the networks can already reach very promising error rates, comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way to further investigations on the problem using deep RNN models.",IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network,2017.0,17,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966294?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966294, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a6b02e3df6e82f3a1c3be4d453fe06d7e7017b03,Long Short-Term Memory Model for Time Series Prediction and Forecast of Solar Radiation and other Weather Parameters,"Interest in the solar radiation and associated meteorological variables have been growing over the years due to their effect on energy generation, agriculture and food security, Ozone layer and other industrial applications. Hence, forecasting these variables in long-term and short-terms using various fusions of measured weather parameters has become a major research focus in many regions. However, developing and selecting an accurate model for the prediction of solar radiation based on several weather parameters is still a challenging task. In this study, a time series model for predicting and forecasting Solar Radiation and other weather parameters was developed using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). A publicly available dataset of Mowo, Osun State, Nigeria containing Longitude and Latitude, Elevation, Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, Precipitation, Wind speed, Relative Humidity, Solar Radiation and Tropospheric Ozone was collected. The LSTM model was trained with diverse compositions like the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, training epochs, and optimization algorithms. Results showed the model had 97%-99% correlation coefficient between actual and predicted values and 99.3%-99.9% prediction accuracy on the test datasets. The LSTM model also forecasted each of the trained variables for a ten-year period between 2015 to 2025 accurately.",Communication Systems and Applications,2019.0,11,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICCSA.2019.00004?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSA.2019.00004, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

8fa014ba85dfad56b61bd8b764d30a6429a2b66b,Applying Scrum to the Army - A Case Study,"Agile methods are now a mainstream production process and its proponents are no longer considered hackers or cowboy coders. Still, in embedded and safety critical domains there is somehow the expectation that the approach be “more” plan-based; at least, many of the current normatives seem to lean toward such approach. A definite change in attitude has emerged with the latest DoD standards in the United States; in Italy, this change has been introduced through a new initiative taken at the 4th Logistic Division of the General Staffs of the Italian Army. This paper reports on this new initiative.Given the recent budget cuts and the concurrent but opposite need to develop a new software system, the General Staff of the Italian Army has decided to partially internalize its software development, asking their contractors to build a mix of military-civilian development teams, composed of around 6-10 developers, and to organize the overall development using an adaptation of Scrum. To this end, the two top officers of the Division have received the appropriate training to become Certified Scrum Product Owners. The project started with one team and, after about one year of operation, has grown to about seven teams, partially geographically distributed. The teams feature approximately one third of military people and two thirds of civilian developers, mostly with an education equivalent to an MSc in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or closely related area. Data about the production process has been collected following a non-invasive approach. The results have been impressive and reassuring on the approach, even if criticality has emerged with respect to a natural resistance toward change and the need of support at the highest possible level to ensure the perdurance of the selected process.The defense software development process is a highly complex endeavor because it has to deal with a complex domain, it has to provide a very high quality solution and it has to satisfy very specific and complex needs. Command and Control software in particular must meet functional requirements that are often extremely detailed as the situations that create them involve a large number of assets and human resources that have to be coordinated in a way that minimizes losses, as any trade-offs may result in the loss of lives.Additionally, defense operations are conducted in conformance with a specific set of strategic rules called “doctrine,” and are further specified in very minute detail in a set of operational manuals that are meant to create familiarity in a series of tasks that have to be executed in difficult situations, e.g., under strict time constraint or in the presence of unknown threats.At the same time, considerable freedom must exist to choose the most favorable course of action, given that the situation evolves continuously and often in unpredictable ways. In a command and control system, for example, the leader in charge of the operations must be able to decide the courses of action for any units under his or her control; and these actions must be communicated rapidly and reliably to any and all such units. The feedback loop is also crucial to understand how the situation evolves in the field.Given the environment in which defense software needs to operate, it is not surprising that until recently, most of the software development process was plan-based: that is, processes that would ensure a high repeatability and predictability. In fact, process standards have been developed by defense agencies and armed forces to prescribe a series of features that every defense software development effort should possess (Benedicenti et al., 1999).In recent years, however, a number of factors have come to disrupt this plan-based software development process culture inside defense, the most disruptive of which has been the change in the very nature of defense efforts. Whereas traditional conflicts have involved symmetrical opponents, and most doctrines have made that assumption at their very core, recent events prove that more and more conflicts involve asymmetric opponents.Evident examples of this change are the fight against terrorism and organized crime. In these situations, a large and highly structured force is poised against a smaller but nimbler contingent. The two opponents often have profoundly different value systems and cultures, which makes very difficult to construct effective strategies without incurring in uncomfortably high risks.This rapid change introduced by asymmetrical opponents has a profound impact on the software development effort. Whereas in the past requirements were very detailed and complex but relatively fixed, recent requirements have become more volatile although they remain equally detailed. This dichotomy cannot be addressed using a standard plan-based development process (Boehm and Turner, 2003).Another disruptive factor is the cost of software development. While the complexity and volatility of requirements increases, the cost of developing a system also increases accordingly. In our experience with the Italian Army, the cost traditional defense software development has risen to approximately 130 Euro per line of code. In of itself, the rising cost of development would not be disruptive, but when it is associated with a considerable reduction in the defense budget and the need for frequent requirement changes, it becomes such (Martinelli 2015).To address the problem described above, we hypothesized that agile development can be an adequate approach for developing software in the defense sector even for mission critical applications. To this end, it is worth recalling how some of the tenets of agile can be structured in the production of software for defense (Cotugno 2015; Messina 2015), in particular with respect to the following aspects:•Frequent releases•Change management•Effective cooperation in a complex environment between requirements owners (goal owners), acquisition owners (gold owners), and contractors, who are numerous in the defence sector and do not traditionally interact easily with one another•Focus on small and empowered teams, to be able to react fast to evolving customer needs and emergency situations, a mentioned in the previous sectionImplementing a Scrum derived agile software development cycle in the Italian Army has required a great effort both for the technical and cultural change. This effort can be summarized by the four “pillars” of effort. The second “pillar” is the most critical since no specific innovative tools are available and the current implementation of the development environment are based on the adaptation of “traditional” software tools and experimental products.The first “pillar” was needed to instill the initial knowledge within the organization. The third “pillar” was necessary to create a user community governance structure which could authorize selected experts to act as delegated “Product Owners” with the same decision power as their heads. This step also required the involvement of the top level authority in the Army. The other pillars have been developed in parallel and are still under construction. It was necessary to create a brand new training process capable of generating agile agents able to act as Product Owners and Scrum Masters in the mission-critical software arena. Probably the most critical “pillar” to build was, and still for the most part is, the innovative CASE tool suite to support and assist software development. To this end traditional tools have been adapted and some new ones have been generated. The criticality is the non-invasive nature of the tools. If the programmers’ time has to be allocated to feed the support environment, the effectiveness of the production cycle decreases. Last but not least a doctrine had to be developed to ensure that any replica of the process throughout the military environment be coherent with the “Italian Army Agile” methodology.The agile approach adopted in this project is based on Scrum. The defense environment, however, required a few changes to make this approach effective. The first step was to obtain a Scrum Alliance certification for key project members. This was achieved relatively painlessly; but creating an agile culture in a plan-based environment required a serious change management effort, as previously discussed. By taking advantage of the pre-existing hierarchical structure of the Italian Army to instill a sense of need, we created the motivation to adopt the new agile method. We then closed the virtuous loop through the standard mechanisms of Scrum enabled through the four pillars mentioned above. As the first few sprints proved the incremental nature of Scrum, delivering increasingly more functional prototypes, the team’s level of confidence in the process grew accordingly.Even though Agile Methods have been discussed for, at least, the last 15 years, there are no conclusive studies on their effect or on the effect of some of their practices. An earlier study of some of the authors of this paper (di Bella et al., 2013) focusing on Pair Programming reported that from 1998 to 2011 there were 30 comprehensive studies, and among these studies there there is a tendency to show that Pair Programming has positive effects on quality, albeit with major concerns. However, there is no convincing statement on the effects of Pair Programming on productivity.Since then a few additional works have appeared but they have not clarified such relations. In particular, the meta-analytical study of Rafique and Mišić (2013), has shown the lack of evidence (or even the presence of counter evidence) of the positive effects of test-driven development (another agile practice) on productivity, especially in industrial settings. Moreover, apart from the aforementioned study by di Bella et al. (2013), most works relate either to academic settings or to small experimentations.The novelty of this paper therefore lies",2016 IEEE/ACM 38th International Conference on Software Engineering Companion (ICSE-C),2016.0,11,1,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/2889160.2892652?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/2889160.2892652, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

d2fb74612658dd23410d4af69f905a6bc864706f,Designing a PSCAD based PV simulator for partial shading to validate future PV application planning,"Partial shading on Photovoltaic (PV) array reduces solar irradiance experienced by PV modules and hence reduces system performance by lessening output power. Thus, to plan for a future implementation of PV system in any place, it is essential to simulate the performance of desired PV array under both uniform and partial shading condition. To fulfil such simulation requirement, a PSCAD based PV simulator for grid connected PV system is proposed in this paper to investigate the performance of a PV system before implementation. The main application of this PV simulator is to simulate different levels of solar irradiance on PV panels for grid connected PV system and study its performance before implementing it practically. To verify the application of this proposed simulator, a case study based on Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus is conducted. The rooftop of building E, Swinburne Sarawak is used to design a PV system and the shadow pattern on the rooftop is monitored for a month throughout the day. Real-time solar irradiance data in 2015 is obtained from Sarawak Meteorological Office. Based on both solar irradiance data and shadow pattern on the rooftop, a computational study is performed for a complete year on how much power can be obtained from proposed PV system using the PSCAD simulator. The power yield from simulated PV system is compared with the load consumption in the university and a simplified cost analysis on the system is carried out to determine the suitability of implementation of such PV array on the rooftop of that building.",IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference,2018.0,9,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/APPEEC.2018.8566639?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2018.8566639, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Recent widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the U.S. now makes possible construction of EHR-based specialty registry data collection tools and reports, previously unfeasible using manual chart abstraction. But the complexities of specialty registry EHR tools and measures, along with the variety of stakeholders involved, can result in misunderstood requirements and frequent product change requests, as users first experience the tools in their actual clinical workflows. Such requirements churn could easily stall progress in specialty registry rollout. Modeling a system's requirements and solution design can be a powerful way to remove ambiguities, facilitate shared understanding, and help evolve a design to meet newly-discovered needs. ""Agile Modeling"" retains these values while avoiding excessive unused up-front modeling in favor of iterative incremental modeling. Using Agile Modeling principles and practices, in calendar year 2015 one institution developed 58 EHR-based specialty registries, with 111 new data collection tools, supporting 134 clinical process and outcome measures, and enrolling over 16,000 patients. The subset of UML and non-UML models found most consistently useful in designing, building, and iteratively evolving EHR-based specialty registries included User Stories, Domain Models, Use Case Diagrams, Decision Trees, Graphical User Interface Storyboards, Use Case text descriptions, and Solution Class Diagrams.",2016 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI),2016.0,10,0,"{'url': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5940340?pdf=render', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/BHI.2016.7455935?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/BHI.2016.7455935, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a34ffb53acba57373dab33c551c8c25161a06563,Visual Exploration of Topics in Multimedia News Corpora,"The increasing availability of digital multimedia content has led to the need of new approaches for the analysis of large databases containing video and associated data, for example, subtitles. Visualization provides valuable insights of such dataset, complementing approaches solely based on techniques for knowledge discovery in databases and information retrieval. Hence, visual analytics, combining automatic processing with interactive data visualization, has proven to be an effective means to explore and interpret such data. The analysis of news corpora represents a typical task for such a scenario. Domain experts such as journalists and social science scholars require an overview of important topics, the temporal coherence of events, and they should be able to compare different topics. We present a visual analytics approach that aims to support these tasks with automatic video preprocessing, topic extraction, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Coordinated linked views support the flexible inspection of the dataset and the processed results. We further discuss the application of our approach in a usage scenario, inspecting the dataset of a daily news broadcast of the year 2015.",International Conference on Information Visualisation,2019.0,5,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IV.2019.00048?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IV.2019.00048, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

22e22ecb36d0b15863db59eb09999096e5818b38,UTM Evolution Into the 2020S – New York as a Case Study,"The New York Griffiss Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Test Site is a designated Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) national UAS test site. With an integrated UAS test facility and airspace covering around 7,000 square miles over central and northern New York State, the test site mission is to promote safe UAS integration into civil airspace through UAS test operations, together with collection and analysis of air traffic surveillance data.Following legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in 2012, the FAA selected New York in 2013 from among 25 applicants as a national UAS flight test site. The FAA noted that the New York planned ""to work on developing test and evaluation as well as verification and validation processes under FAA safety oversight."" The FAA role for New York was research on ""sense and avoid capabilities for UAS and to aid in researching the complexities of integrating UAS into congested northeast airspace.""This paper describes the test range data collection and instrumentation capability, employing multiple ground-based air traffic sensors to track both cooperative and noncooperative manned aircraft. Sensors include wide area multilateration (WAM or MLAT), ADS-B, and 3-D primary radars.The original test site concept was to support development of RTCA minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) for ground-based radar air traffic surveillance systems. RTCA standards in this area apply to ability of unmanned aircraft (UA) to remain well clear of and avoid collisions with manned aircraft. The test range would become a proof-of-concept for future ground-based detect and avoid (GBDAA) systems for UAS beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) operations in the airport terminal area and in transition to enroute airspace.In 2015, the New York UAS test range started to support NASA UAS Traffic Management (UTM). This required adding an ability for UAS remote pilots to detect and remain well clear of, not only manned aircraft, but also small UAS operating below 400 ft. above ground level (AGL).A major step in 2016 was a $30 million New York State award to develop a 50-mile Rome to Syracuse New York UTM corridor. The grant, along with state financial support for unmanned and connected systems development, enabled investment in a five-year program for air traffic surveillance, data collection, cyberphysical security, safety risk management, and commercialization.Working with NASA and FAA through succeeding UTM Capability Level demonstrations from 2017 to 2019, New York prepared a foundation to go beyond demonstrations and build a versatile and long-life UTM systems integration and operational testbed covering a wide geographic area.The paper reports on New York UAS Test Site development and lists challenges into the mid-2020s for unmanned applications, focusing on UTM evolution and UTM’s contribution to safe UAS integration into the NAS.",International Conference on Networking and Services,2020.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICNS50378.2020.9223007?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNS50378.2020.9223007, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

506b5033947c03177ed308976dbebc542b6fff1d,Performance Evaluation of Mobile Broadband Cellular Networks in Pakistan,"Pakistan is a rapidly growing cellular market with a growth rate of 185 % in number of mobile broadband users during 2014-16 and over 15.75 million mobile broadband users [4]. The exponential increase in broadband penetration demands investigation of mobile broadband performance from an end user perspective. To the best of our knowledge, no extensive study exists to document mobile broadband services experience in Pakistan except a recent Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) QoS report [8]. This deficiency of evidence is distressing because benchmarking Mobile Wireless broadband performance is primarily important for customers in Pakistan as well as for mobile operators. This will help both mobile operators and regulators to improve and maintain an acceptable level of quality of service. Thus, we conducted a pilot study to benchmark and analyze quality of user experience of mobile wireless users by deployment of an Android application for mobile customers to measure performance of each cellular broadband provider (Ufone, Telenor, Zong, Warid and Mobilink) in Pakistan. We analyzed performance attained at the end user device, quality of service that users are getting and identified performance bottlenecks and possible reasons. On basis of these results, we provide insights to improve mobile broadband internet services (3G and LTE) in Pakistan. Among our list of mobile operators, performance of Zong is the best in 3G networks followed by Mobilink. We consider throughput and latency as core characterizing parameters. Zong 3G has higher sustained throughput, better latency to international servers but in other factors like average signal strength, jitter and last mile latency, Mobilink 3G is superior than Zong 3G. Zong 4G performs better in overall results whereas Warid performs better in last mile latency and jitter.

9d9e1a076c2d1454d9e25347f926b0c1c42250c9,Ocean surface current prediction based on HF radar observations using trajectory-oriented association rule mining,"HF (high frequency) coastal radar system is used to capture the surface current behavior — in terms of velocity and direction — in the ocean near the coast. 18 HF coastal radar stations were implemented along the Gulf of Thailand in order to monitor for disasters (e.g., Tsunami) as well as relevant risks. The HF systems are also to serve other life-critical applications, such as water quality control and monitoring, chemical spill backtracking, and marine navigation. However, not all the applications can benefit from this near-real-time HF data; some applications in different domains require forecast values. The examples include search-and-rescue system and hazardous materials spill trajectory prediction. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a predictive model for future current data based on historical HF coastal radar data sets, utilizing association rule mining combined with an object dispersion concept. So, the full potential of HF radar systems can be exploited. The spatial and temporal dimensions are taken into account when designing our predictive system, which consists of two phases: ocean surface current track formulation and spatio-temporal association rule mining. The experiments are performed on a two-year HF radar dataset (2014–2015) using Google Cloud Platform. The resulting forecast current values: velocity and direction are then compared with testing datasets (using 10-fold cross validation) of the actual recorded values and evaluated based on percentage accuracy and RMSE, respectively.",2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2017.0,6,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/BigData.2017.8258457?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData.2017.8258457, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

020c94009b0e44a18e60aa33b757724ee2778fe5,Modeling the Total Electron Content variation in the Ionosphere for Improved Positional Accuracy,"The total electron content (TEC) in the ionosphere produces a group delay in the propagating signal of a navigational satellite and produces a range error. This error in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is corrected by the fixed Klobuchar ionospheric model in the single-frequency receivers. The performance of the Klobuchar error correction is lowered due to the irregular and complex distribution of TEC in the equatorial and low latitude regions. This is further affected in the equinox month of March and during geomagnetic disturbances. In this paper, model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed to predict the ionospheric TEC range half an hour in advance. The TEC thus predicted can be further used for estimating a suitable correction to minimize the range error. The model can apriori estimate the range of mean value of TEC at t+δt using the input features at time t. The model is trained using the TEC values of all days, Disturbed Storm Index (Dst), Auroral Electrojet index (AE), time of the day and extracted features of TEC. The performance of the model is also compared by changing the input features and its accuracy is measured using precision, recall, F score and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. It is observed that the model performance is improved by adding extracted features of TEC and is able to predict the mean TEC range half an hour in advance with better accuracy. The model is also tested with unseen storm day TEC data and is found to perform well with 80% accuracy. The equatorial anomaly region near the geomagnetic equator is chosen for the study. The TEC data is obtained from the International GNSS Service (IGS) dual-frequency receiver located at IISC, Bengaluru, India for the equinox month of the year 2015 for training the model.",European Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2020.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ECAI50035.2020.9223247?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ECAI50035.2020.9223247, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The ultimate objective in this research is to design and implement novel and scalable methods for extracting knowledge and computational history. While citations are highly used to identify emerging/rising research topics, they can take months or even years to stabilise enough to reveal research trends. Consequently, it is necessary to develop faster yet accurate methods for trend analysis and computational history that dig into content and semantics of an article. Therefore, this paper aims to conduct a fine-grained content analysis of scientific corpora from the domain of Machine Learning. This analysis uses DeepHist, a deep learning-based computational history approach; the approach relies on a dynamic word embedding that aims to represent words with low-dimensional vectors computed by deep neural networks. The scientific corpora come from 5991 publications from Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference between 1987 and 2015 which are divided into six 5-year timespans. The analysis of these corpora generates visualisations produced by applying t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction. The qualitative and quantitative study reported here reveals the evolution of the prominent Machine Learning keywords; this evolution supports the popularity of current research topics in the field. This support is evident given how well the popularity of the detected keywords correlates with the citation counts received by their corresponding papers: Spearman’s positive correlation is 100%. With such a strong result, this work evidences the utility of deep learning techniques for determining the computational history of science.",IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network,2019.0,3,0,"{'url': 'https://www.open-access.bcu.ac.uk/7343/1/IJCNN_Paper2019.pdf', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': 'mit', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852140?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852140, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

a60ce57dac99da590e90713a0b266179a79f23d3,A comprehensive community energy storage planning strategy based on a cost-benefit analysis,"Energy Storage (ES) has been seen as a crucial element in active distribution networks. It facilitates a high penetration level of intermittent renewable energy in power systems thus provide several technical and economic benefits to the utility and consumer. However, given a high capital cost associated with ES, it is crucial to develop an effective planning strategy to avail the maximum benefit. This paper proposes a methodology to determine the optimal location and capacity of Community Energy Storage (CES) units by considering all their possible benefits and costs. The benefits are obtained from energy arbitrage, peaking power generation, energy losses reduction, Transmission and Distribution (T&D) system upgrade deferral, CO2 emission reduction and VAr support, while the costs include CES's capital, replacement and Operational and Maintenance (O&M) costs. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is conducted to identify the optimal Net Present Value (NPV), Discounted Payback Period (DPP) and Benefit Cost ratio (BCR) of CES investment starting at current year, year 2025 and 2035. Numerical results show that the proposed strategy is able to specify the optimal location and size of CES unit for maximizing the NPV.

1c6e8b612f38349214890ef464a33e45359f20ea,A systematic review of features identification and extraction for behavioral biometrie authentication in touchscreen mobile devices,"Today, mobile devices are being widely used in personal and professional life. By increasing the popularity of touchscreen platform as an input method in mobiles phones, touch gesture behaviour is becoming more significantly important in interaction with the phone. Due to increasing demand for safer access in touchscreen mobile phones, old strategies like pins, tokens, or passwords have failed to stay abreast of the challenges. By utilizing touch gesture behaviour biometric techniques, the authentication mechanism will improve and would make it more difficult for a shoulder surfer to replay the password, even if he observes the entire gesture. The purpose of this research is to conduct a systematic literature review SLR for the current state-of-the-art in the field of touch features gesture. The results of this research identified thirteen touch features followed by the previous studies (PSs) to authenticate users. However, based on the schemes followed by the previous studies (PSs) there was not any scheme that extract and use all touch features for mobile user authentication. There are number of areas of future work that could be carried out to advance upon this research and within the area of authentication on mobile devices. Each of the pervious study (PS) extracted only one or more features. The maximum number of features used in S14 year 2014 and S15 year 2015 were seven features. Extracting thirteen touch features and use them for the authentication will be one contribution in future work.",International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology,2018.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.23919/ICACT.2018.8323647?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.23919/ICACT.2018.8323647, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

119a647bbcd94a8a64c7b4562a819d92d72d39e0,Analysing Performance of Company through Annual reports using Text Analytics,"Investors and financial analysts mainly rely on Annual Reports to decide on the company's current performance and make calculated plans on their investments. Annual reports provide an overview of firms past performance, how they make use of the external environment for their growth needs, their strategies for growth and their expectations for the future. The financial information presented in the financial statements is a combination of textual and numerical information. The numerical information includes the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement, which constitutes about less than 20%. The remaining 80% are textual in nature, which includes footnotes, letters from executive leaderships, strategies, leadership team, shareholder details, and various reports including directors report, sustainability report, corporate governance report. Until recent years, financial analysts use conventional methods like ratio and trend analysis primarily based on numerical information for analyzing the performance of the organization. So far textual data in annual reports were considered as complex and categorized as inaccessible information for the huge number of novice investors. This paper tries to investigate how the textual component of Annual report can be used deduct meaningful information about company's performance by employing text analytics. Text analytics uses statistical pattern learning for understanding the trends and patterns, which in turn provides information of high accuracy. This is attained by working on the unstructured information spread across different section in details, extract meaningful data contained in the text, convert it to numerical, and then use it along with relevant data mining algorithms. The research tries to answer 2 questions; 1. How emotions in the annual reports as a whole determines the current performance of the company, 2. Does these emotions have an impact on the expected returns on the forthcoming year. We conducted a descriptive research, selecting 12 IT Firms functioning in India. The research considered annual reports for a period of 3 years starting from 2015–16 to 2017–18, thereby creating 36 samples. We performed mining on these reports using Bing Lexicon for sentiment analysis as well as NRC lexicon for emotional analysis. The structured data analysis was collected from Bloomberg. Risk and Return analysis were done on the Market performance of the subsequent years. We employed statistical techniques on these data to create multivariate models. The results suggest that companies' current performance plays an important role in the emotions in the annual reports. We also noticed an established relation between the emotions in annual report and future performance of the firm. We concluded that text analytics can be efficiently used on the unstructured data present in annual reports and the results can be effectively used by the stakeholders using these data to make their decisions based on companies' performance.",IEEE International Conference on Dielectrics,2019.0,1,1,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICD47981.2019.9105673?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICD47981.2019.9105673, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

9ad44eac42639b6e183080d4f0c3c0f2fe6e9857,CoStock: A DeepFM Model for Stock Market Prediction with Attentional Embeddings,"Forecasting the stock market trend is a vital component of financial systems. Traditional methods mainly rely on quantitative trading data to make predictions. With the increasing volume of Web information, researchers begin to extract effective indicators (e.g., the events and sentiments) from the Web to facilitate the prediction. It is beneficial to fuse the heterogeneous multi-sourced data to achieve superior performance. Existing solutions adopt simple data fusing methods with conventional machine learning models, which may fail to effectively model the complex interactions among the data. With the success of deep neural networks (DNN) in various fields, we propose a DNN-based model that considers the various interactions and complex correlations among the multi-sourced data into one unified framework. In such a framework, the low-and high-order feature interactions are modeled with the factorization machine and the deep neural network respectively, and stock correlations are incorporated with an attention-based feature embedding method. Evaluations on the stock data from the year 2015 to 2017 show that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2019.0,1,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005649?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005649, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

05b71452e2eed61e1d418898dc5f3c7a1a763fa1,Digital and information literacies and the school library,"You can’t teach people everything they need to know. The best you can do is position them where they can find what they need to know when they need to know it. (Seymour Papert) 
 For school librarians, this is certainly part of a core responsibility, to provide students with digital literacy skills and strategies that will enable them to find and access information at point of need, in order to create knowledge (Farkas, 2011). While students are growing up in this digital age, research reveals they are not necessarily skilled in reading to locate and use online information effectively (Leu, Zawilinski, Forzani, & Timbrell, 2014b; Pickard, Shenton & Johnson, 2014). This is significant when “students overestimate their ability to engage with information in a critical and literate manner” (Kirkwood in Beetham & Oliver, 2010, p.162).  Yet, students are required to be ethical and critical thinkers, and engage as collaborators and creators in participatory digital environments (Coiro, 2003; Mackey & Jacobson, 2011; Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL), 2015). 
This exploratory case study seeks to investigate Year 5 students’ (ages 10-12) learning experiences within a school library program. It endeavoured to explore the pedagogical background, motivation and steps in implementing digital and information literacies. Did these sessions provide students with the emergent skills and strategies to support independent research and collaborative inquiry as they began their International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (IB PYP) Exhibition?",IASL Annual Conference Proceedings,2019.0,0,0,"{'url': 'https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/slw/index.php/iasl/article/download/7384/4280', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.29173/iasl7384?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.29173/iasl7384, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b384a31f156afcc30186e22aff0c7575c6c49d5a,Development of Behavior Monitoring System for Honeybees in Hive Using RFID sensors and Image Processing,"Recently, a new research field “Computational Ethology” is attracting much attention from not only biologists but also computer scientists because advances in computer technology enabled to automate the measurement and the analysis of animal behavior. Especially, analyzing communications performed by honeybee workers in their hive is one of the most important and interesting issue in ethological research area to reveal a mechanism of honeybee's language. However, these analyses have been usually conducted by manually extracting honeybee's walking trajectories from recorded long-time video data. For a systematic and theoretical analysis of honeybee's communication, we have developed an automatic tracking algorithm of multiple honeybees using image processing and constructed an automatic recording system for long-term tracking of honeybee behaviors with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors and high-resolution camera modules using multiple small-size single board computers, Raspberry Pi. Using this system, we conducted recording experiments from 6:30 am to 7:30 pm during one month once or twice per a year from 2015 to 2018. In this paper, first we show the overview of a behavior monitoring system of honeybee in hive. Next, we explain the simultaneous tracking algorithm we proposed. Finally, we show the experimental results and confirm the system capabilities.",International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering,2019.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/JCSSE.2019.8864160?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/JCSSE.2019.8864160, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

23825e5fa62ac823e6e282f682600571fc58a84e,Experimental FSO network availability estimation using interactive fog condition monitoring,"Free Space Optics (FSO) is a license free Line of Sight (LOS) telecommunication technology which offers full duplex connectivity. FSO uses infrared beams of light to provide optical broadband connection and it can be installed literally in a few hours. Data rates go through from several hundreds of Mb/s to several Gb/s and range is from several 100 m up to several km. FSO link advantages: Easy connection establishment, License free communication, No excavation are needed, Highly secure and safe, Allows through window connectivity and single customer service and Compliments fiber by accelerating the first and last mile. FSO link disadvantages: Transmission media is air, Weather and climate dependence, Attenuation due to rain, snow and fog, Scattering of laser beam, Absorption of laser beam, Building motion and Air pollution. In this paper FSO availability evaluation is based on long term measured data from Fog sensor developed and installed at TUKE experimental FSO network in TUKE campus, Košice, Slovakia. Our FSO experimental network has three links with different physical distances between each FSO heads. Weather conditions have a tremendous impact on FSO operation in terms of FSO availability. FSO link availability is the percentage of time over a year that the FSO link will be operational. It is necessary to evaluate the climate and weather at the actual geographical location where FSO link is going to be mounted. It is important to determine the impact of a light scattering, absorption, turbulence and receiving optical power at the particular FSO link. Visibility has one of the most critical influences on the quality of an FSO optical transmission channel. FSO link availability is usually estimated using visibility information collected from nearby airport weather stations. Raw data from fog sensor (Fog Density, Relative Humidity, Temperature measured at each ms) are collected and processed by FSO Simulator software package developed at our Department. Based on FSO link data the FSO link and experimental FSO network availability was estimated for years from 2007 up to 2015. The average FSO network availability up to 98,3378 % was measured (for the BER 10-9). From the experimental data also Hybrid RF/FSO link availability was evaluated. As the weather conditions for FSO and RF link are complementary (FSO works well in rain and RF works well in fog) Hybrid FSO/RF system long time average availability was much better up to 99,9986 %.",Polish-Slovak-Czech Optical Conference on Wave and Quantum Aspects of Contemporary Optics,2016.0,4,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1117/12.2263614?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2263614, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

04e77cf3d5e76651b0179184f8ce4edf478f7bd2,Profile-oriented programming teaching to non technical students: A case study,"Programming education has been one of the most complex tasks in higher education over the years. One of the great difficulties that students face when they start a curricular unit linked to programming is to acquire skills which allow them solving real life problems through the use of algorithms. Such skills require the development of the ability to abstract as well as to apply algorithms development techniques. These difficulties are even greater when students attend to a course that does not have as main objective the programming of computers and their basic education is on non-technological areas. As a result of the difficulty in obtaining these competences, there are high failure and dropout rates in courses related to this study field. In order to solve this problem, we propose a methodology based on VARK questionnaire and students background to define the students' profile and, consequently, define what are the appropriate educational materials and tools. To validate this model, a pilot experiment with students to be divided into two groups was carried out, in the academic year 2015–2016, with the application of the model to one of them.

This program is the follow-on to the COSMIC / FORMOSAT-3 mission, which was a joint US-Taiwan 6-satellite constellation demonstration mission launched in April 2006. The COSMIC mission was the world's first operational GPS radio occultation (GPS-RO) mission for global weather forecast; climate monitoring; atmospheric, ionospheric, and geodetic research. The GPS-RO data from COSMIC has been extremely valuable to the climate, meteorology, and space weather communities, including real-time forecasting users as well as U.S. and international research communities. FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC reached the end of its design life in 2009 but continues to provide useful data to users around the world, some 7 years later. Some of the satellites have exhibited unrecoverable anomalies and consequently the critical real-time satellite observing capability continues to degrade and will likely go offline completely in the next few years. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO) recognize the potential GPS-RO data gap due to the degrading COSMIC/FO RMO SAT-3 constellation and agreed to implement the follow-on COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT mission in 2010. Despite both sides experiencing programmatic difficulties in the past several years throughout the course of implementing the COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 Program, significant progress has occurred over the past year. The program successfully completed Critical Design Review (CDR) Part A (CDR-A) in March 2015 and the Ground and Data Processing Segments successfully completed their CDR in September. The COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 Program continues to make progress towards its September 2016 launch date. This paper will provide a brief overview of the COSMIC-2 / FORMOSAT-7 Program including the Program objectives. It will also discuss the status of the various segments of the Program including the spacecraft design and payload technology, current status of satellite integration and test activities, existing and planned equatorial ground system architecture required to meet data latency requirements.",IEEE Aerospace Conference,2016.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/AERO.2016.7500755?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2016.7500755, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

4e49ea2c03748e509684ff65ffec7d0f874c16d0,GAM Modeling on Power Consumption for Campus Buildings,"Precise prediction of power consumption is critical to power generation planning, which is important to overall power demand and supply management. Power consumption for university campuses is different from that of general office buildings and shopping malls due to, among other factors, the particular academic calendar that includes summer and winter vacations. GAM (Generalized Additive Model) model [1] is a powerful tool to fit a set of response data to a collection of explanatory variables for its exceptional capability of modeling interacting explanatory variables though nonlinear smooth functions. GAM has been successfully employed in power prediction for modeling targets like research covering office buildings and nation-wide consumption. However, the most difficult problem in applying GAM modeling is how to find the right fitting GAM formula in the first place. In this regard, this paper proposes a general form of GAM demand model based on human daily activity. On top of this general form, we propose an AOO (Adding One by One) algorithm to find a fitting GAM model for a particular target based on historic data collected from that particular target. In particular, in the context of power consumption modeling, we train the general GAM model by a year-long historic power consumption data of year 2014 from a university campus to derive prediction models for both the expected value and its variance. The two resultant fitting GAM formulas thus obtained for both expected value and the associated variance have been applied to predict the power consumption for the following three years of 2015–2017. The prediction results have shown preferable performance, MAPE for expected value and CAE for variance, over that predicted by the GAM models reported in the literature [2].",Cybersecurity and Cyberforensics Conference,2018.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.23919/CHICC.2018.8482747?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.23919/CHICC.2018.8482747, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b5341f6e624dec1c069671390b54e02ec85e9a12,Appropriating a Climate Science Discourse About Uncertainty in Online Lessons,"In an online lesson on climate change, pairs of students make claims in the context of uncertainties, using graphs from authentic scientific publications designed originally for public use. As students grapple with describing and delimiting sources of uncertainty discerned from these rather sophisticated graphs, they migrate from attributing uncertainty to themselves to climate-related phenomena. The dialogue between students appears to be instrumental in the strengthening of uncertainty-based claims and explanations. Discourse about uncertainty Some of the earliest studies on human experience with uncertainty noted the distinction between internal attributions of uncertainty and external ones (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982). To attribute uncertainty internally to the competence of the self forecloses personal agency to resolve or delimit uncertainties arising from natural phenomena. To attribute uncertainty externally suggests a disposition to make sense of the indeterminacy of events in the world. Science curricula have traditionally downplayed or ignored the essential uncertainty of scientific practice, discouraging those students otherwise disposed to look externally to not bother trying. This inaccurate depiction of science deprives students of agency to formulate and explain claims based on limited and fallible evidence and thereby diminishes incentives to learn science (Lemke, 1990). Content understanding is enhanced with attention to the scientific practices of constructing and critiquing claims (Ford, 2008). For this reason, scientific practices have become a central feature of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013). The online lessons described here on the topic of climate science are part of a suite of lessons where public concerns intersect with controversies within specific fields of science. Climate change is a collective problem complicated by, and perhaps even limited by, citizens’ abilities to participate in productive conversation about it (Corner, 2012). These lessons provide scaffolded instruction around scientific graphical representations as well as user-friendly simulations so as to facilitate explanations and conversation. Students make claims based on evidence while also reflecting specifically on how certain they are and to which factors they attribute any uncertainty. Analyzing screen captures The students described here participated in a series of online tasks on climate science in a public high school in the northeast of the United States. We recorded their work via computer screen capture, a process that also captured their talk. This paper limits itself to two episodes, as the analysis is ongoing and results are preliminary. The first episode involves a lesson on solar irradiance and the second involves future trends in temperature. In our analysis we transcribe student talk and then search for themes, using methods of interaction analysis (Jordan & Henderson, 1995). Our guiding concern is to determine interactional factors that contribute to the written responses that students provide in these online tasks. Each task sits on a single webpage along which students can scroll and into which they submit a series of responses to prompts. Due to constraints in our study at the time, our data do not include video of the students themselves, only their shared screen. Though this is not ideal, it is still feasible to inspect their interaction via their speech and, at times, their cursor movements. Appropriating an uncertainty-infused discourse These lessons discursively position students as competent agents capable of making claims. They orient students to features of authentic graphical representations by providing some contextual information. This is necessary because interpretation goes beyond merely taking up presented evidence. Interpretation is predicated on ways of seeing and making things see-able distinctive to a given discipline (e.g., “highlighting”, Goodwin, 1994). That is, people have to be taught to see. So, the extent to which students can draw evidence from data depends crucially on how the data are framed for them. Explicitly addressing uncertainty as part of scientific activity raises questions for students as to how to construe uncertainty in relation to themselves. Typical curricular materials rarely elevate or highlight uncertainty as a salient and productive aspect of scientific practice. It is perhaps counterintuitive to dwell on uncertainty when cultivating the making of claims. But concerted reflection CSCL 2017 Proceedings 577 © ISLS on the tentative and provisional nature of scientific claims should foster greater confidence in them, not less (Latour, 2004). This is because the means of creating an argument conveys essential information about its strength and durability. The students working on these tasks tend to engage in considerable uncertainty-related talk as they prepare written responses to uncertainty-enriched argumentation prompts. In doing so they “appropriate” (Levrini, Fantini, Tasquier, Pecori, & Levin, 2015) climate science discourse in order to deal with what for them are novel forms of uncertainty. To appropriate a discourse is a matter in part of identifying oneself as a legitimate practitioner and of having the resources available to begin to participate successfully. Uncertainties in the solar irradiance task: General imitation versus waviness In the Solar Activity Task (see Figure 1), students are told they will make arguments based on evidence. They are first prompted to make claims about whether, “Based on the graph, is Earth’s temperature dependent on the level of solar activity?” Since this is an original graph from a scientific publication, let us first note the rich senses of uncertainty embedded in it that the general public would encounter. Both the following year’s temperature and solar activity are highly uncertain based on what we know about the present one, as indicated by the light-colored, erratically-varying lines. This uncertainty in yearly fluctuations is managed somewhat by means of a darker, relatively smooth lines described as the “11 yr average” for each quantity. Based on our knowledge of the 11-year average for a given year, the 11-year average for the next year is comparatively less uncertain. By taming somewhat the fluctuations in quantities in this way, it becomes more feasible to see beyond year-to-year variations so as to inspect trends over decades. The original authors’ intent was to show to the general public that solar activity and temperature run parallel (until about 1960) and then diverge. Figure 1. Cropped Portion of Screenshot of the Solar Activity Webpage for Annie and Betty. The audience for this lesson consists of students rather than the general public. In providing a limited synopsis, the webpage for the lesson explains that, “The graph shows Earth's air temperature and solar activity (irradiance) from 1880 to 2009. Solar activity includes sunspots, solar flares, and other solar weather events. The light-colored lines show the yearly measurements, and the darker lines show the average of 11 years of temperature or solar irradiance data. Earth's temperature is affected by many different factors” (cropped out of Figure 1). By giving students the task of making claims with only limited additional information, the task frames the interpretation of this authentic scientific graph as an activity students are capable of doing as well as any other public person. And they can presumably do so without having to attend to the layered meanings of some terms (e.g., the unit, W/m2) or deeper reflections on the data processing of measurements (e.g., How the earth comes to have a singular temperature for a given year). Table 1 illustrates the kind of conversation that can transpire with a task of this kind. The left column includes the time elapsed in seconds since the beginning of the episode, to provide information on the duration of turns of speech. In the right column, brackets indicate overlapping speech. The two speakers are Annie and Betty (all names are pseudonyms). In Line 1, Annie reads the question out loud and the two students take some time to think about a response. In Lines 2 and 3, they do not initially agree as to which bullet to select, “yes” or “no.” In Line 3 Annie asks rhetorically whether temperature imitates solar activity, answering her own question negatively. In Line 4, Betty signals disagreement, while nevertheless expressing some new doubt in that it may only imitate it partially. In Lines 5 and 7 Annie contrasts an imitation that is (merely) general in some way with a waviness that shows lack of (authentic) imitation. In Lines 6 and 8 Betty agrees but it is unclear whether this agreement is in regard to the general imitation or to the lack of imitation in waviness. In Lines 7-9 Annie elaborates further, characterizing the waviness in terms of some curve being especially “spikey.” She appears to CSCL 2017 Proceedings 578 © ISLS indicate the Total Solar Irradiance Yearly, since it is the most erratic-looking. In Line 10, Betty at first goes back to her initial pick of, “yes,” despite having just agreed to what Annie had just been saying about the waviness. But after a pause, she assents to Annie’s preferred answer. In Line 11 Annie follows up by elaborating on the lack of dependence in terms of not fitting. Later, after Line 11, Annie and Betty wrote, “The temperature and solar activity do not match in terms of “fitting together” because their graphs are not aligned, the temperature is not dependent on the solar activity.” Betty appears to initially construe imitation in terms of a correspondence between the darker lines up to 1960 (“for a little bit”). What is uncertain, then, is the permanence of this relation between 11-year running means. But Annie construes imitation in terms of how erratic the light lines are. What is uncertain is how well measures remain stable f",International Conference on Computer Supported Collaborative Learning,2017.0,0,0,"{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22318/CSCL2017.82?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22318/CSCL2017.82, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

b8ca4c84ccc4dc64bbdee196d71c96a3857cc3a9,Performance Parameters of Speed Control,"The effect of speed control to resolve aircraft conflicts has not been well described in literature. Previous investigations on speed control have suggested some performance parameters such as resolution rates. In this paper additional performance parameters such as resolutions per flight, per conflict cluster and constraining aircraft are investigated by the comparison of speed control with other resolutions. This will help to give a better understanding of the effects of speed control on the overall air traffic management system regarding capacity, feasibility, safety, economy and ecology. I Speed Control And Automation Speed control is one of the measures that air traffic controllers may use in conflict resolution. However, clearances involving speed are almost unused in European upper en-route sector control (<<1%) [1], whereas transfers, level changes, direct routing and vectors are most commonly used. Speed control has not been studied for the purpose of automation yet, or at least there is no significant literature. The literature that treats algorithms for automatic conflict resolution mainly discusses horizontal vectors and, to a lesser extent, vertical resolutions, but very few suggest the use of speed adjustments. Only some project documentation treats speed manoeuvres, e.g. the CORA project [2]. Also, the operational concept of Airborne Separation Assistance (ASAS) investigates the possibility of chaining and 1 Presented at the 24 Digital Avionics System Conference, October 2005, Washington D.C., U.S.A. spacing aircraft in sequence for easier handling of (arrival) flows [3], so-called station keeping, with a consequence of similarities in speed of the targets, but is not explicitly giving speed instructions. The same spacing principles apply to the procedures over the Atlantic Ocean that space aircraft on in-trail sequences on similar speeds or with a specific radar separation buffer. All Arrival Manager tools set time constraints on arrival fix points, and aircraft can accomplish the time contract with speed adaptations [4][5]. This concept of metering fixes can further be generalised into the en-route phase to organise aircraft into flows, e.g. [6][7]. Those flow organisers do not include a conflict resolution function using explicitly speed, at least this has not been found documented. The procedures of sequencing aircraft with speed, however, do differ from generic speed instructions, because they only use one dimension of the geometry (along-track conflicts). If, instead, speed-instructions are used for all kind of conflict resolutions, they will be used in all dimensions of the possible conflict geometries. The Automated En-Route Air Traffic Control (AERA) concept [8] in its very early versions mentions speed restriction measures where the automation system tags traffic that should not be touched by the controllers and pilots, because it is recognised as not being in a conflict situation if nothing happens. This could be regarded as a “maintain speed and heading” clearance, hence a speed instruction that is given by the system. J. Villiers [9] introduces the notion of speed adjustments as a means to make what he calls “subliminal” control, which could be considered as an automation system that creates “lucky traffic” so that controllers, who would still be part of the system, would not have to intervene on the traffic. The automation system would use speed adjustments for this, and the controllers would neither see nor have to know about hidden automatic operations, because they would not perceive the speed changes. The previous study on the potential of speed control [10] has given initially promising results. More knowledge has to be sought on this topic in order to better understand the effects of speed control. This paper analyses additional performance parameters with the help of model simulations and compares speed control with other resolution manoeuvres. II Simulation Setup The Reorganised ATC Mathematical Simulator (RAMS) was used in its version RAMS-Plus5.04 and 5.20. The scenario was reused from the 5 States Fast-Time Simulation [10] with an area extending from London/Paris in the west to Berlin/Prague/Vienna in the east and from Copenhagen/Malmö in the north to Lyon/Milan in the south. More than 140 sectors from 24 ATC Centres were simulated. The measured centres were limited to en-route and to Karlsruhe, Maastricht and Reims, which corresponds to 36 en-route sectors above flight level 245. The traffic baseline simulates a traffic sample from 12 Sep. 1997, which corresponds to 100%. This was increased to 150, 200 and 300%, which emulates roughly traffic loads for the year 2005, 2010 and 2025 for optimistic traffic growth predictions. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 00 :00 02 :00 04 :00 06 :00 08 :00 10 :00 12 :00 14 :00 16 :00 18 :00 20 :00 22 :00 KARLSRUHE MAASTRICHT REIMS Figure 1: Number of aircraft per hour for three measured centres (150% scenario).

260bdad73771608dcf2c8c840d5bc07eeb1a23c5,Comprehensive Assessment of Sustainable Utilization of Water Resources Based on RBF Neural Network Evaluation Method,"Comprehensive assessment of sustainable utilization of regional water resources, including three subsystems: social economy, water resources and eco-environment, is a large complicated and systematic evaluating problem. The selection of the index system for the regional sustainable development of water resources was discussed herein. Furthermore, a neural network methodology for regional water resources evaluation was introduced. The method adopts the Radial Basis Function (RBF) architecture and dynamically penalized rival competitive learning algorithm, which is fast and repetitive, compared with most traditional techniques. Additionally, a new approach to produce training samples, testing samples and examining samples randomly distributed between the critical values was established. The sample used consists of 16 indexes, and by using the proposed methodology the sustainable evaluation of regional water resources could be successfully done. Results showed that from 1994 to 2005, the comprehensive index of water resources sustainable utilization in Zhengzhou city ascended with a fast speed of 0.023 per year, from sustainable development level IV to level III. The calculation with the model showed that, the comprehensive index of water resources sustainable utilization in the future planning years (2010, 2015, and 2020) could be enhanced with a speed of 0.011 per year. A sensitive analysis indicates that it is necessary to increase eco-environmental water consumption rate, industrial output from each cubic meter of water consumption, public greenbelt area per capita, foodstuff output from each cubic meter of water consumption, and to ensure that natural growth rate of population decreases steadily, which are playing an important role in improving sustainable utilization of water resources in Zhengzhou city.",International Conference on Electronic Computer Technology,2009.0,3,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICECT.2009.145?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECT.2009.145, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

3eed94658d8e100409c77ca143a80ca96f62cefd,GSM/GPRS Erlang capacity analyses and simulations under air traffic loading conditions,"This paper looks at the general packet radio system (GPRS) technology as an alternative communications technology for the air traffic users within a managed air space. This technology can compliment, or back up the more conventional links such as VHF digital link modes VDL 2,3,4. Theoretical maximum speeds of up to 171 kilobits per second (kbps) are achievable with GPRS. In addition, it is a widely accepted migration step toward Third generation universal mobile telecommunication system (3G UMTS) which will provide even more capabilities through the use of wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA). This study involved the computation of availability/blockage of voice and controller pilot data link communications (CPDLC) data over GSM/GPRS. The Erlang B was used for the voice, while the Erlang C was used for the data services to compute the availability of each. Traffic loads are obtained for the airport, terminal, and enroute airspace domains. Several parameters that effect the availability results were studied including the outage definition time, range of service data, number of available TDMA logical channels, and buffer size. The results show very good availability for busiest airspace demand rates for year 2015. Overall, the voice communications will reduce the system availability the most, followed by the data applications. The most significant reduction of ideal maximum capacity is probably the limitation of the controller's human capability to handle a large group of aircraft within a sector. Nonetheless, automation advancements may improve that limitation in the future",IEEE Aerospace Conference,2005.0,2,0,"{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/AERO.2005.1559484?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2005.1559484, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
